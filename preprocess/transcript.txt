[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880]   Welcome to the WAN show everyone.
[00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.920]   The truth is, I screwed up this week.
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.820]   It's very obvious that, I mean, I just couldn't conceal it anymore.
[00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.720]   We were paid by NVIDIA for our RTX 4060 TI review.
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.800]   And the scariest part of what I just said is that a not insignificant number of people
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.600]   are going to take that at face value, not watch any more of the video, and believe it
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.000]   for the rest of their days.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.680]   Let's talk about how confusing people found our review of the 4060 TI.
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.200]   We're also going to be talking to you guys about how confusing I'm finding Sony's new
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.640]   handheld accessory.
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.320]   It's a Wi-Fi based PlayStation 5 streaming thing.
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.120]   Did they learn nothing from the Nintendo Wii U?
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.680]   What else we got going on this week?
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.320]   It does seem like the Wii U was just like actually too early at this point.
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.320]   It's starting to feel that way.
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.560]   It really feels like it.
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.560]   Wow.
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.240]   Invisible PC set up.
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.440]   This was actually super cool.
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.440]   Did you see this?
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.440]   I read the comments.
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.440]   Oh, great.
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.360]   We'll talk about it later because you'll probably need to see it if you want to talk
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.600]   about it more specifically.
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.600]   But who knows?
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.600]   Maybe.
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.600]   We'll see.
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:21.320]   The National Eating Disorders Association replaced a helpline with a chatbot because clearly
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.680]   no one there has watched the WAN show.
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:46.040]   Oh.
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.160]   The show is brought to you today by Vessi, Signal Wire and Corsair.
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.400]   All right.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.520]   We're going to jump right over to my laptop here.
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.480]   And this is one of those things where, Luke, I feel like we need to open the conversation
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.720]   back up.
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.280]   Open it back up about shadow banning companies.
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.080]   Shadow banning people do it because just do it.
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:15.840]   I actually found the comment section of this video extremely difficult to handle.
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.120]   Let's see.
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.960]   See, some people get it.
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.160]   Please keep calling out this nonsense.
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.160]   This was an extremely negative review.
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.760]   It started with, oh, thank you, NVIDIA.
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.200]   At least you didn't downgrade this graphics card.
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:40.880]   I literally, literally said something actually positive after some negative things.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:49.800]   And then I said, okay, that last one wasn't sarcastic because I am aware that a not insignificant
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.600]   portion of our audience does have a little bit of trouble picking up on sarcasm, whether
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.560]   it's like a social cue challenge thing or whether it's the fact that English isn't their
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.560]   second language.
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.920]   English is a really weird language.
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.080]   Rather is their second language.
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.080]   So I made it actually explicit.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:16.600]   And the number of comments that are just, let me see if I can, let me see if I can, let me
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.600]   see if I can find this.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.960]   Oh, man.
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.680]   This is, see, this is frustrating because-
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.840]   The second you need them, they're not there.
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.320]   Yeah, the second one I need it.
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.520]   It's not there.
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.960]   That's just how like presenting things on stage or on camera.
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:32.960]   It's just how it works.
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.160]   Okay, where's my phone?
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.760]   Because I sent you one on Discord that was just absolutely mind-blowing.
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.960]   The point is not to call it any specific user.
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:41.960]   Don't go looking for this.
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.520]   But we've got a couple of comments in a row here.
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.320]   Like, why can't you just say it's a bad deal?
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.120]   You're not crapping on Nvidia makes it look like you're caping for Nvidia.
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.800]   Not saying you are, but that's what it looks like.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.800]   This review also feels short and unrigorous.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.000]   This is a rare thumbs down for me.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:07.880]   We had probably more game benchmarking than just them we've ever had before.
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.040]   Extremely rigorous.
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.320]   The whole thing is automated now.
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.360]   All of our testing.
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.880]   This is something to note.
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:19.080]   All of our testing was fresh on the latest drivers for every one of those cards.
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:23.120]   That is extremely unusual, but it's also extremely important.
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.760]   I mean, you can include numbers from three months ago or six months ago, but as we've
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:33.480]   seen, especially with Intel Arc, and especially when AMD launches anything, within a span
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:41.520]   of two, three, six months, you might as well just say, "I hate AMD and don't feel like
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.120]   showing them in a fair light."
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.960]   You might as well just say that because if you're not including fresh numbers, that's
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.200]   not valid.
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.480]   It's just actually useless.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.040]   You might as well just kind of go, "You might as well approximate."
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.000]   Well, I didn't have the XT, so I don't know.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.120]   It has 10% more CU's, so I bumped the clock speed 10%.
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.120]   This is an approximation.
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.120]   You know what?
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:10.440]   It would probably be reasonably close, but it's disingenuous to label the chart in 6700
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.520]   next year, whatever it is, this next one.
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.160]   Thank you.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.360]   I haven't been watching LTT, and now I remember why.
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.800]   The only reason I clicked was I was hoping the title was sarcasm, but weird how he kept
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.960]   looking for positive things to say when the card is straight up garbage, trying to stay
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.600]   in Nvidia's good books.
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:36.760]   I haven't been in Nvidia's good books for like a couple years now.
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.200]   That's not how this works.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.080]   That's not how any of this works.
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:46.920]   The reason that we're looking for positive things to say is because our reviews are designed
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:53.480]   to be everything you need to know about the card, and the price, the price is fluid, right?
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:58.080]   So if you come back to this video in a couple years and you want to know what features does
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:04.120]   it have, how does it compare to the cards that are similar around it?
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.840]   Honestly, one of the things the labs did a great job of this time was including older
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.160]   cards.
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:16.160]   The number of positive comments we got from people saying, "Wow, thank you so much for
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.560]   putting a couple of older cards on the graph for a change.
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:25.440]   Now I have some idea how this compares when I'm looking for an upgrade was really awesome.
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.960]   I just want to give a huge shout out to the writers, huge shout out to the lab.
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:37.160]   I'm actually really, really proud of our 4060 Ti review and our RX7600 review.
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.400]   There are a couple of things we got wrong.
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.120]   I think we had a table in the 4060 Ti review that said it had a 16x interface.
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.000]   It has an 8x interface.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.320]   That is a problem if you're upgrading an older platform.
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.280]   On a modern platform, it's not a problem.
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:55.240]   It doesn't affect the numbers that we showed you guys, but that is something that we could
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.240]   have gotten a little bit better.
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.360]   I think there were a couple small things in the 7600.
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:04.520]   But every time we release a new GPU review, we're getting a little bit cleaner about it.
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.800]   It's a lot of moving parts, guys.
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:12.880]   But this is one of those things that I'm just looking at going, "Give me a reason not to
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.000]   start shadow banning again."
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.440]   This is another one that I saw on today's video.
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:22.480]   It was a short on the Billy Billy Gold Play button that we got for reaching a million subscribers
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.920]   on Billy Billy.
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:28.240]   Which is super awesome, huge shout out.
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.760]   Dennis has been deeply involved in that over the years.
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:36.400]   He's been involved in that over the years and helped foster the community over there.
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:42.440]   Our translation team over in China, all the members, past and present, just shout out all
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:46.840]   those people for making this possible.
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.720]   This is the takeaway that someone got.
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:53.880]   Was not expecting Linus to take a knee to China after saying he will never visit because
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:54.880]   of the CCP.
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.320]   What a hypocrite.
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.320]   Here's something.
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:03.560]   It actually costs us money to run that Chinese channel.
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:08.800]   Because I won't go to China anymore, I have no way of getting any of the ad revenue that
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:12.160]   we've made from that channel out of China.
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.520]   It's all just stuck there.
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:19.120]   It's just something where there was a fan group that was translating our videos, pirating
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.840]   them, uploading them to Billy Billy.
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:24.160]   We went, "Hey, please don't do that.
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.160]   But how about this?
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:30.120]   How about we actually compensate you for it and we'll make the whole thing official?"
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:35.640]   That way we can have a proper presence there with translations and all that good stuff.
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:39.080]   If it's going to get pirated anyways, we might as well do it properly.
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.080]   We might as well do it properly.
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:45.760]   It's just one of those things that I look at and I go, "Why do I have to read that?
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.560]   Why do I ever, whether you're trolling?"
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.680]   Which honestly, I don't think so.
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:53.240]   I've got a pretty good radar for it these days.
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:57.320]   No, some people actually are that brain dead.
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:03.480]   Whether you're trolling, if you are, or whether your takes are just that bad.
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.160]   I used to care about this a lot.
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.160]   Like shadow banning?
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.160]   Yeah.
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.160]   Like thinking it was a bad thing.
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:10.160]   Yeah.
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.160]   Then what happened?
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.160]   Is it just because I send you these?
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.560]   Not even sort of anymore.
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.560]   I'm actually completely on the other side now.
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.320]   This might piss some people off, but it's just the reality.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:25.040]   In my opinion, back when I was a stalwart defender of like, "You shouldn't ban people,"
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:28.680]   the internet was in a bit of a different spot.
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:36.680]   And now like, I don't know, you get how many comments every day and it's like, "Yeah,
[00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.680]   I don't know.
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.520]   Is that helping anything?"
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:41.520]   Yeah.
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.520]   Like actually at all.
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.480]   Is this beneficial for anything?
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.000]   Are you going to change anything?
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.520]   Is this any discourse coming from this that is helpful?
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:50.520]   Yeah.
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:51.520]   So I've been scrolling.
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:52.520]   Here's another one.
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:53.520]   This review was way too lenient.
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.440]   This card is garbage, end of story.
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:57.440]   It's not garbage.
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.440]   That's just, I don't know what to tell you.
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.440]   It's not garbage.
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:11.600]   I feel like people have gotten kind of a twisted, like a twisted perception of what garbage
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.120]   is.
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.400]   At the right price.
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:21.320]   Does it, do you plug it into your computer and does it shart FPS onto your monitor?
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:26.560]   Does it do so without overheating, without causing blue screens?
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:28.360]   Does it harm your dog?
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.960]   You know, like, is it bad?
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:32.600]   No.
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:33.600]   It's overpriced.
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.600]   It's not worth it.
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.600]   That's its problem.
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.600]   Yeah.
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:41.600]   NVIDIA is marketing a 50 series card as a 60 Ti card.
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:42.600]   And that's a problem.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.840]   And pricing it as such.
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.840]   And that's a problem.
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.240]   But it doesn't make it garbage.
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.720]   It makes it overpriced.
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:54.360]   Like if you found it and it was that card and it was on a mad discount.
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:55.360]   Yeah.
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.360]   Maybe it's all right.
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:57.720]   Absolutely.
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.080]   And happy 45, 30 first.
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:01.120]   There's no criticism allowed on LTT videos, I guess.
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.520]   Say anything bad, they shadow bend you.
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:04.760]   Let's say, see, that's not true at all.
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:05.760]   We have no problem.
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:06.760]   That is not a point.
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:09.040]   We have no problem with constructive criticism.
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.960]   What it is, is I just, I don't...
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:15.120]   I just want to continue his arguments, trying to start things just for the sake of trying
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.600]   to start things like, I don't know.
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:18.600]   Yeah.
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:22.240]   I just, I just can't.
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:28.560]   And, oh man, we've actually got a video coming where I kind of lean into this.
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:30.560]   I was having some fun with it.
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:34.240]   I kind of brought back the scrapyard war spirit though.
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:38.880]   So everyone's getting kind of, you know, mad at me for not going hard enough on NVIDIA.
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:39.880]   And I shouldn't say everyone.
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:41.320]   I like dislike ratio on that video.
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:44.240]   It's still about 92%, 93% or something like that.
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.640]   It might even be higher now.
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:50.160]   Because it tends to be that it's that initial rush of people, like the really hardcore tech
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:53.640]   people that are like, "Oh, this review wasn't critical enough," or whatever the case may
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:54.640]   be.
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:58.640]   But the number of people that are mad at me for not going hard enough at NVIDIA is if
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:02.680]   I have any kind of influence whatsoever on NVIDIA.
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.640]   It's just comical to me at this point.
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:11.120]   So I wrote up a little intro because I wanted to address that, right?
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:15.760]   So it kind of goes along the lines of like, "Are you tired of GPU manufacturers screwing
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.280]   over your wallet?"
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:20.240]   Well, it's time to take action here.
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.240]   Let me show you what to do.
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:25.200]   I kind of do a little flourish with my wallet and put it in my pocket.
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:28.920]   And then do you remember the Windows 3.1 sound that's like, "Duh-duh!"
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.760]   I did it.
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:33.240]   I didn't open it.
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:39.880]   And I worked with Nicole from the editing team to, "There's this really cool transition that
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:46.000]   we can do where if you do a whip pan and then a whip pan back, you can use two completely
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.120]   different shots as long as that blur is of approximately the same things.
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:56.800]   So it actually whips away from me to me standing in the studio.
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:00.520]   And I'm like, "Your performative boycott means nothing.
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:02.920]   You have more than enough GPUs for a..."
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:07.360]   I basically get to be my own like peanut gallery.
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.280]   Your performative boycott means nothing.
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:10.640]   Blah-blah, you're...
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:11.640]   Anyway.
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.000]   And I'm like, "Baaah!"
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.480]   And then it like whips back to me.
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:22.120]   And it was a really fun video because I basically went scrapyard war shopping and showed that
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:26.880]   you can get a sick system upgrade for a great price right now.
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:27.880]   Is it getting better?
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.720]   And not giving video or AMD any money.
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:40.800]   In fact, I had so much fun that I'm kind of thinking we might have to bring it back.
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:41.800]   No way.
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:42.800]   I think we might have to.
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:43.800]   No way.
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:44.800]   It was so fun.
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:45.800]   Man, I...
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:46.800]   We're back boys.
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:47.800]   Let's go.
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:51.800]   I basically said, I set a budget for myself.
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.440]   All right.
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:59.120]   I set a budget for myself of approximately the price of a 40...
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:00.120]   4060 Ti.
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.120]   Okay.
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:06.480]   I managed to beat it by about 30% while still saving like 20 bucks.
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.880]   Oh, performance beat it by 30 bucks.
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:09.880]   Oh yeah.
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:10.880]   And save 20 bucks.
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:11.880]   Oh yeah.
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:12.880]   Scary our wars.
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:13.880]   Oh, that's the best.
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:17.600]   And I have almost a year of warranty on the card I got.
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:18.600]   Damn.
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:19.600]   Okay.
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.760]   What could go wrong?
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:23.760]   Sick.
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:25.440]   I won and won and won some more.
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:27.680]   And I got a video out of it, which is winning four times.
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:28.680]   That's a win.
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:30.240]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:35.240]   And so I'm looking at it going like, oh yeah, we got another comment over here on the 40.
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:37.600]   You must have been paid to review this card.
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:44.760]   People like that clearly have no idea what it's like to work with a brand on a paid promotion.
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:45.760]   You do.
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:46.760]   Yeah.
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:49.000]   Would you be allowed to open with a sarcastic...
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   No.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.600]   Thank you, Nvidia, for at least not taking away any VRAM.
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.360]   No, not even sort of.
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:58.360]   You sure?
[00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:59.360]   Yeah.
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:00.360]   Are you sure?
[00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:01.360]   Dude, we...
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:02.360]   Because it seems like you would be able to.
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.880]   Based on some of the comments.
[00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:04.880]   Yeah.
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:05.880]   I wonder how much...
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:09.040]   We've had stuff kick back for like a lot less than that.
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:10.240]   This is great.
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.080]   Ah, hold on.
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.080]   Hold on.
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.080]   Where did it go?
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.080]   Must have been paid.
[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.080]   Super cool.
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.080]   Excellent.
[00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:18.080]   Smart comment.
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.680]   How much they paid.
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:24.120]   This video doesn't feel so honest, but I get it from a business perspective.
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.120]   No.
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.120]   No.
[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:27.840]   You actually don't.
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:28.840]   You get nothing.
[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:30.160]   You're not on our side.
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:32.320]   You missed the whole thing.
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:35.320]   Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh.
[00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:37.920]   Um, yeah, I don't know.
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:38.920]   I just...
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:42.080]   Anyway, massive, massive shout out to the team.
[00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:43.680]   Really, really happy with those reviews.
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:46.240]   Really excited for the direction the lab is going.
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:50.560]   We've had some really cool and exciting meetings lately with the team over there.
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:54.880]   I think we're going to be ready to roll out some of the category specific channels.
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:59.360]   Um, because I think I've talked about this on The WAN Show before, but one of the...
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:06.400]   One of the directions that I see online content going is I see mega channels.
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:13.720]   Like the MKBHDs and LTTs, actually even to a lesser degree, Marquez, because he is kind
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:14.720]   of niche focused.
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:15.720]   A little bit more focused.
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:26.040]   Now that he's split cars off of MKBHD onto autofocus, it's kind of mobile devices and
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:27.040]   consumer electronics.
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:30.320]   So it's relatively narrowly focused, right?
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:31.640]   Compared to ours.
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:35.000]   Whereas we are as broad as, okay, this week.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   Uh, what...
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.560]   Is this thing powered by something?
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:47.840]   This week we uploaded a tour of ASML, who makes the lithography machines that, um, help
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:54.520]   manufacturers like Intel and TSMC produce the world's most cutting edge microchips.
[00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:58.480]   Uh, so like super, super deep technical video.
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:03.960]   And then we also built a silly hundred thousand dollar computer for playing Minecraft.
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.640]   We water cooled to bed.
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:10.840]   I basically did a YouTuber video where I talked about, you know, what's going on in my personal
[00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:12.560]   life, my job role changed.
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:15.000]   Like, we are all over the map.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.960]   Just reviews of a couple GPUs.
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:22.360]   Um, so the way that I see it, it's going to be much, much harder to attract a loyal audience
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:27.880]   to a channel and therefore build a loyal audience for a channel unless you're focused.
[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:31.480]   And the way that I see it, if you have a power supply focus channel, you're going to
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:32.880]   get two different viewers for that.
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:38.000]   You're going to get people who really want to stay up on what's going on in power supplies.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.440]   And then you're going to get people who haven't cared about a power supply in six years,
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:48.760]   but they're building a new computer and they're going, sorry, 16 pin what?
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:51.800]   Uh, what's, I don't care.
[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:53.280]   Just tell me a good one, right?
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:54.960]   So you're going to get a lot of those.
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:18:01.680]   Our goal, our goal for a power supply specific channel will be, and I, you guys can quote
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:06.680]   me on this to have a video for every power supply.
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:11.080]   Like every new one that comes out.
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:13.160]   Well, we're going to have to work on.
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:14.160]   Are you including server ones?
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:19.000]   The back catalog to know, okay, no, like ATX, ATX.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.120]   It's going to be money in doing server ones.
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:25.320]   There could, but I mean, almost nobody builds a server anymore.
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:26.240]   Ah, yeah, fair enough.
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.200]   It's almost exclusively bare bones.
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:31.480]   And I could, I could see us having a more enterprise.
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:38.000]   Uh, IT sort of focus channel at some point where we would look at bare bones servers and
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.080]   look at these, at these platforms as a whole, but that would be something that would come
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:47.280]   later and it would be more along the lines of how we would test something like laptops.
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:48.280]   Laptops.
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:54.280]   Oh man, laptops are deep to cover a laptop properly.
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:58.000]   You have to have your methodologies down for everything.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.440]   Battery testing, screen testing, keyboard testing, processor testing.
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:07.880]   Oh, don't forget that you're going to have to account for different environmental factors.
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:11.960]   Don't forget that you need to test it in different power profiles depending on whether
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:14.360]   it's plugged in or unplugged.
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:15.720]   Laptops are going to take some time.
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:16.720]   Oh yeah, right.
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:21.600]   And don't forget that per model, per chassis, they're available in, I don't know, about
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.200]   25 different configurations.
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:32.000]   Um, I, do you remember when I optimistically bought one of every config of the M1 MacBook,
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.040]   thinking, okay, we're going to get like our laptop methodology down and we're going to
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:43.560]   be the outlet that actually can tell you exactly which configuration to buy, like bang for
[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:44.560]   the buck.
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:47.840]   And then they basically all got deployed to people who wanted MacBooks internally and
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:49.320]   scattered to the high winds.
[00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:54.120]   Yeah, that was a good investment.
[00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:59.640]   Anywho, the idea is that eventually we're going to get there and then all the ones that we
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:00.840]   don't need anymore.
[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:05.680]   We'll just divest ourselves of by flipping them at LTT store, not com or an eBay or whatever.
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:07.920]   We'll figure all that out.
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:11.520]   Um, it's time for us to jump into our next topic here.
[00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:14.960]   Apparently, Dan is not going to let me talk about haters anymore.
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:18.280]   Do you want, can we talk about this, the Sony thing?
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:19.280]   Yeah.
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:23.640]   Sony PS5 announcements at the, their PlayStation showcase.
[00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:28.180]   Sony announced their new handheld projected to come out later this year called Project
[00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:29.340]   Q.
[00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:35.480]   The handheld allows remote play of PS5 games via wifi at up to 1080p and 60fps.
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:37.400]   It has an eight inch LCD screen.
[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:42.120]   I have no idea how much it will cost and it's unclear whether it will do anything else other
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:46.720]   than stream PS5 games or whether it will be able to use cellular networks, considering
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.040]   they specified wifi.
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.040]   I kind of doubt it, but we'll see.
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:51.040]   Yeah.
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:53.840]   Things where the answer is no.
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:54.840]   Yeah.
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:57.640]   Um, also lossless wireless earbuds.
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:58.640]   Okay.
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:02.800]   Uh, the PlayStation showcase also highlighted a number of upcoming games.
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:06.560]   Sony announced slash showed off several standard PS5 games.
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:10.000]   The only notable exclusive being Spider-Man 2.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.160]   Uh, okay.
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:16.400]   Some notable not exclusives, a remake of metal gear three, a reboot of Bungie's marathon
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:17.400]   series.
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:18.400]   That's.
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:19.480]   I know right.
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:23.080]   Sony owning Bungie just makes my brain hurt.
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:29.240]   Yeah, but it's not exclusive, which is also the whole thing is just like, it's weird,
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:30.240]   but maybe really cool.
[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:34.440]   I haven't been able to look into any of that yet because I had a very busy week, but I'm
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:37.840]   pretty interested in the idea of them rebooting marathon.
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:38.840]   We'll see.
[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:43.320]   Alan Wake to a splatoon alike called foam stars.
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:47.840]   And the one Riley is most excited about the Talos principle to, I think quite a few people
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:49.440]   are going to be excited about that.
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:51.440]   It's a PVP extraction shooter.
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:56.760]   Oh, I think you've got his attention.
[00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:02.160]   Oh my bungee making a PVP extraction shooter is extremely exciting.
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.160]   Like the division.
[00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:05.840]   Okay, that part makes it a lot worse.
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:08.960]   Okay, hopefully it's not like the division at all.
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:13.000]   Division was terrible in my opinion, but I'm sure someone liked it.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   Okay.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.760]   I want to talk about this wireless console thing.
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:22.960]   Is it just me or like very little use for this?
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:26.520]   Why don't you just play on your TV?
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:28.000]   I don't know how to feel about this.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   Okay.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.640]   So first of all, here, let's flip over to my laptop.
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:33.720]   This is this is apparently what it's going to look like.
[00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:35.280]   I think it looks cool.
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:36.280]   Yeah, it looks.
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:40.040]   It actually looks like it's probably comfortable to hold and stuff too.
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:41.040]   Here's my problem.
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:45.760]   I don't know how to feel about this because I've been kind of all over the place.
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:46.760]   Yeah.
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:49.440]   I loved the Nvidia Shield.
[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:50.440]   Yes.
[00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:55.480]   And yes, Android games did exist that could be played with a controller, but at the time
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.440]   they were way less common.
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:04.800]   So it was fundamentally only a device for streaming your gaming PC to a handheld form
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:05.800]   factor.
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:08.600]   And I was crazy in love with that thing.
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:13.880]   It was it was how I played games when I had infant children because you basically had
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:17.320]   the kid kind of in the thing in your arms and you could play video games.
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:18.960]   There was no way you could sit at a computer.
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:19.960]   So that was it.
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:21.640]   That was how I could play video games.
[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:22.880]   Love that.
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:28.000]   And then, you know, I was less bullish on the Steam link, which is basically the same
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:34.560]   idea except that it allows you to play your gaming PC games on your TV with a Steam controller
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:36.800]   or some other controller or whatever else.
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:40.560]   And then I'm trying to think of kind of what came what came next here.
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:44.400]   I never really used the Nvidia Shield console for that for that function.
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:47.240]   It just didn't really appeal to me.
[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:53.120]   And then when Logitech, okay, when Logitech announced the G Cloud, I was looking at it
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:58.280]   going, well, this is just kind of stupid because you could get a Steam deck for like
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:02.000]   a hundred dollars more that actually has a full computer in it.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.080]   But then I reviewed the G Cloud.
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:09.560]   And even though I was a certified hater of the thing, I actually really liked it.
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:10.920]   Like, I really liked it.
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:13.040]   I've got nothing against the concept of this.
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:16.040]   I'm a little bit concerned about what I expect the price might be.
[00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:20.600]   Well, then there's the Wii U. Did you ever use the wireless controller pad function of
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:21.600]   the Wii U?
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:22.960]   Did you ever even look at that screen?
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:23.960]   Yeah.
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:24.960]   Really?
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:29.640]   I am a rare Pikachu Wii U enjoyer.
[00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:34.360]   I really liked the Wii U. I was, I actually genuinely very much liked the Wii U.
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:36.360]   I even loved.
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:41.840]   Okay, so the Super Mario Bros, whatever it was that came out for the Wii U.
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:43.400]   New Super Mario Bros Wii U.
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:45.560]   It had a four player co-op feature.
[00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:46.560]   It is a dead.
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:54.720]   With a fifth person that used that main controller, had their own screen, and you could put down
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:57.160]   like emergency platforms for your teammates.
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:01.240]   You could also troll them by while they're like mid jump, put a platform right in front
[00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:03.040]   of them and they smack into it and fall down.
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:06.280]   You could like try to fight your own team from actually completing the level and all
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:07.680]   this kind of stuff.
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:09.720]   Extremely fun.
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:10.720]   That's very fun.
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:13.280]   That's very unique experience too.
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:14.280]   That's fair.
[00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:15.280]   And very fun.
[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:17.400]   I played a bunch of different games on the Wii U. They're all really good.
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:22.320]   I am deeply convinced that the only reason why the Wii U didn't do well was because no
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:28.160]   one knew that A) it existed or B) what the hell it even was.
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:32.000]   My group of relatively techy friends, when I first bought it, I invited them all over
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:37.840]   because I wanted to play the five person Super Mario Bros. thing.
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:45.560]   Literally all of them thought that I bought some expansion for my Wii.
[00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:47.200]   None of them knew that it was a dedicated company.
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:48.200]   Sweetish made?
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:50.000]   What did I say?
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.440]   Did I say something wrong?
[00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:52.440]   No, no.
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:53.840]   You're just an expansion for your Wii?
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:58.920]   I'm asking if it's Sweetish made.
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:25:59.920]   But yeah, I don't know.
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:01.680]   I really enjoyed the Wii U.
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:03.680]   And that controller, one, is very- That's sort of-
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:04.680]   That's sort of-
[00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:06.680]   There is his bag, baby.
[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:13.440]   That controller was actually very comfortable.
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:14.440]   That's true.
[00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:15.440]   Yeah.
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:16.440]   Yep, it's true.
[00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:18.920]   Like, more comfortable than the Switch is by a lot, in my opinion.
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:19.920]   Okay.
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:25.240]   I do want to keep talking about this paradigm though because I had another opportunity to
[00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:32.360]   look at a device that's basically this and I have to confess, I kind of blew them off
[00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:36.160]   because I just didn't really care.
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:40.280]   So you always expect it to suck and then it's actually okay?
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:44.240]   Well, no, it's not that because I was so jazzed on the shield, right?
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:45.240]   So here, hold on a second.
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:48.080]   I'm just going to jump back over to my laptop for a second here.
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:50.960]   This is from PeakDow of all people.
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:51.960]   Remember these guys?
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:57.880]   They had this low latency HDMI streaming thing.
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:03.520]   So it's millimeter wave, which is a problem because that means the range is going to be
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:08.280]   pretty fubar, but 1080/60p, so 60 Hertz.
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:16.760]   And the pitched sort of use case for this thing was actually streaming your PlayStation
[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:17.960]   5 to it.
[00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:21.600]   Compatible of PC, PlayStation Xbox, Windows, Switch, etc.
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:26.840]   Two and a half milliseconds delay up to 30 meters or whatever and three hour battery
[00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:28.000]   life.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:36.760]   And I kind of looked at this and I went, that seems really niche.
[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:45.520]   And Sony just laid down a big fat, I think you're wrong Linus because they are releasing
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:53.000]   a first party accessory that's just this.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.760]   If this thing could work over cell networks, it would be sick.
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:56.760]   It doesn't.
[00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:57.600]   I know it doesn't.
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:01.200]   You don't want see people keep asking for this.
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.720]   You don't want to game over a cellular network.
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:04.720]   Yeah, fair enough.
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:05.720]   Yeah.
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:06.720]   And okay.
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:07.720]   I know.
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:08.720]   Some games would be doing it.
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:09.720]   I know.
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:10.720]   I hear you.
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:11.720]   Someone be told.
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:15.480]   I can actually hear your keys heating up as you furiously type a message about how
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:20.560]   much you love using Moonlight over a cell network or whatever.
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:22.400]   Steam Link.
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:25.200]   I know there are certain types of games.
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:28.200]   You want to play like a puzzle game or something.
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.200]   No problem.
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:31.840]   By all means, play over a cellular network.
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:36.320]   But wherever you live, A, your cell network must be a lot better than mine.
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:41.320]   So maybe you're in like Tokyo or you're in like Seoul or something like that.
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:42.320]   Sure.
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:43.320]   Fine.
[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:45.320]   Cell network is a lot better than mine.
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:49.240]   B, you must have a really great data plan.
[00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:51.800]   Both of those things are true in a lot of ways in the world.
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:52.800]   Absolutely.
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:54.640]   People are in their house internets off cell.
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:55.640]   Absolutely.
[00:28:55.640 --> 00:29:00.040]   However, even under those ideal conditions, there are certain genres of games that are
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:03.880]   just not going to be fun with the additional latency.
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:07.560]   And I just, I wouldn't, I wouldn't compromise on that.
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:09.560]   I just wouldn't.
[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:12.520]   I love what Sony is doing right now though.
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:14.840]   PSVR2 is awesome.
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:15.840]   Yeah.
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:18.320]   This, I don't know if it's awesome.
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:19.320]   It looks cool.
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:20.320]   But it's cool.
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:21.320]   Yeah.
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:22.320]   It's different.
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:23.320]   Yeah.
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:24.320]   It's not just.
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:25.320]   I am 100% certain.
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:26.320]   Well, it's not necessarily for me.
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:27.320]   That's some people will love this thing.
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:34.160]   Like Microsoft, how hard have they lost this generation of gaming at this point?
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:38.040]   You, you could play PlayStation games in the bath.
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:39.640]   Yeah.
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:40.640]   I could.
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:41.640]   That's pretty sweet.
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:42.640]   But I could.
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:47.960]   But it's because not necessarily 100% for you, but someone could fit that use case.
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:48.960]   That's pretty cool.
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:54.960]   I do, I do wonder, and Conrad's echoing this in the, in the chat, how much is it going
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:55.960]   to cost?
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:58.760]   Them not announcing a price is like a little sus.
[00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:03.800]   It is, it is a, it is a wee, wee bit sus.
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:06.360]   I think it's not, I think it's not going to be cheap.
[00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:08.200]   I mean here, here, you know what?
[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:12.840]   I can get you pricing for that peak dough thing because realistically it's the same, same
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:15.440]   hardware.
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:16.440]   You know what?
[00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:19.720]   I don't know if I ever got a final price because I think it was a Kickstarter or something.
[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:20.720]   Right.
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:21.720]   That was one of the other reasons that we didn't cover it.
[00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:25.400]   I don't, I don't like covering kick starters.
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:29.880]   Speaking of which, we should talk about that sponsor spot fail this week on tech wiki.
[00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:31.600]   I'll, we'll address that a little bit later.
[00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:33.120]   Don't let me forget.
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:36.160]   No, I don't have, I don't have a price for this thing.
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:39.880]   So if I had to guess, I'd say it'll probably be similar to the G cloud.
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:45.640]   So in the 250, 250 US to 299, I think this is going to be a very expensive accessory.
[00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:50.720]   But again, I do think some people will eat that, but that's something that Sony has demonstrated
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:53.440]   that they're totally willing to do.
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:58.880]   I mean, the PlayStation VR two is an accessory that costs as much as the bloody console.
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:30:59.880]   Yeah.
[00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:00.880]   Like, okay.
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:10.560]   That's not cheap by any means at all, but like it's not, it's not 700 bucks.
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:12.600]   Because it's not dedicated handheld.
[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:17.160]   Yeah, you're not, you're not buying a, you're not, you're not buying an accessory.
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:20.440]   You're buying a completely different experience.
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:21.440]   Yeah.
[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:26.280]   And yeah, that's something that Sony has done a really good job of here is creating different
[00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:27.600]   experiences.
[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:35.160]   And it's not going to have quite the mobility of the switch, but man, I got to, got to take
[00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:40.120]   a moment and just appreciate how crap the switch is these days.
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:46.480]   I own a switch OLED, a top of the line switch, if you will.
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:48.800]   And I own tears of the kingdom.
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:53.600]   You guys saw my copy that I bought on the short circuit.
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:32:00.680]   And I am currently in the process of getting my, my Yuzu all set up for the trip that Luke
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:04.920]   and I are going on so that I can start tears of the kingdom on a platform that doesn't
[00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:05.920]   suck.
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:06.920]   Yeah.
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:07.920]   Yeah.
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:08.920]   The switch is over six years old.
[00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:09.920]   Yeah.
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:10.920]   And it was garbage when it came out.
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:11.920]   That's the worst part.
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:17.680]   By the way, Jake, Jake from the lab is talking in the float plane chat about what I said about
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:19.960]   cellular networks and, and game streaming.
[00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:24.160]   And he's like, yeah, the problem is not how many gigabits per second or whatever you
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:25.720]   can get in the speed test.
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:29.400]   The problem is that this is real time data and latency matters.
[00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:33.840]   And so if anything arrives, even ever so slightly out of order, it's going to be garbled.
[00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:37.680]   And that's something you simply can't control on a cellular network.
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:41.440]   It's extremely challenging.
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:45.000]   And yeah, yeah, people are talking about like what, what ping time I get or how many
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   megabits I get that that is not the point.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.600]   It's just a very, very, even though it feels the same to us.
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:53.000]   It's the same thing with frame times.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.640]   Yeah, I click link and page load.
[00:32:55.640 --> 00:33:00.120]   It feels the same to us, but it's a really different technology.
[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:01.120]   Yeah.
[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:03.440]   All right.
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:06.240]   It's time for us to explain merch messages.
[00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:10.440]   If you want to send a message into the show, the way to do it is with the merch message.
[00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:14.760]   Hey, look, G or G just scored an insulated water bottle.
[00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:17.320]   64 ounce at LTT store.com.
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:22.280]   When you're in the checkout, you can send when you're in the cart, you can send a
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:26.280]   merch message and our producer, Dan, will try to respond to it.
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:29.200]   It's going to be a bit of a shorter show today because Luke and I have to catch a flight.
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:31.440]   We'll talk about that in a little bit.
[00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:33.440]   And so our producer, Dan might respond to it.
[00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:35.480]   He might just put it up on the bottom.
[00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:39.200]   And if there's no replies, who knows?
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:41.880]   Maybe chat can help reply to your merch message.
[00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:44.800]   We might need some help from you guys today.
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:50.040]   Or Dan is going to curate some of them for me and Luke to address later on during when
[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:51.920]   show after dark.
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:55.560]   Since we're talking about what's going on on the store, why don't we tell you guys about
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:59.000]   a couple of new items?
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.120]   I don't see them in the thing here.
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:03.920]   Yes, I do see them in the thing here.
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:07.680]   We just launched our perimium joggers.
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:09.120]   Who is this with that drip?
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:11.760]   It's got to be like Bella Mons or something.
[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:12.760]   Oh, no.
[00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:13.760]   It's got the whoever it is.
[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:15.680]   They've got the swag stance going on.
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:19.920]   Definitely got the swag stance.
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:22.200]   These are super nice, by the way.
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:23.680]   Got them in two different colors.
[00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:25.320]   I'm actually going to have to check these out.
[00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:26.320]   Black and olive.
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:28.760]   Man, love this.
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:29.760]   Great pose.
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:31.560]   I do want some joggers.
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:32.560]   Sammy.
[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:34.080]   There's Sammy.
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:35.400]   He gets the poses, man.
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:36.400]   Yeah, Colton.
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:37.400]   He tries.
[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:38.400]   Colton doesn't.
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:39.400]   There's that.
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:42.240]   We've got contrast going on.
[00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:43.720]   Solid for him.
[00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:44.720]   That's fantastic.
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:45.720]   Yeah, fantastic.
[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:47.400]   Yeah, these are super nice.
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:48.800]   Oh, look at this.
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:49.800]   What a nice write up.
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:53.600]   You know how we've talked about how we don't do a good enough job sometimes?
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:54.600]   Hey, let's go.
[00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:57.440]   Made of 100% recycled polyester.
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:58.440]   Sick.
[00:34:58.440 --> 00:34:59.680]   Very cool.
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:03.840]   We also launched one other product this week that you guys are going to want to check
[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:05.080]   out.
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:10.000]   I wouldn't necessarily wear these two together, but you know, hey, you can definitely get
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.520]   them both.
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:12.520]   Very different feel.
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:13.520]   Yeah.
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:19.360]   We've had a lot of people ask us for stuff that they can wear to work that still matches
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:24.880]   the comfort that they know and love from our other products, but that is workplace, workplace
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:25.880]   ready.
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:26.880]   Colton.
[00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:27.880]   Fucking really.
[00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:31.400]   I swear I've seen him do exactly that.
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:33.080]   I don't know why.
[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:34.080]   Yeah.
[00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:35.680]   But like I've seen him do that.
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:37.360]   Why does Colton do anything he does?
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:38.360]   I don't know.
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:47.400]   It's available in green and charcoal melange, super comfy and OK, who wrote these?
[00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:52.360]   This shirt is softer than a freshly pixelated kittens fur.
[00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:55.280]   What?
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:56.280]   Pixelated kittens.
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:57.280]   What does that even mean?
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:00.880]   I have no idea, but it is it is comfy.
[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:02.880]   It's interesting.
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:05.240]   It probably would get people to keep reading.
[00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:06.640]   So maybe it's good.
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:11.160]   The joggers are available in two colors and two lengths.
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:13.960]   And the polo shirt is available in two different colors.
[00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:20.400]   Oh, now seems like as good a time as any to talk about LTT is hiring.
[00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:21.400]   Oh, yes.
[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:25.280]   Wait, I'm supposed to show the jobs page and I am also.
[00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:26.280]   I'll do the reading.
[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:27.280]   I'll do the read.
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:29.240]   Okay, I'll show the jobs page.
[00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:32.480]   Bullet point one writer slash video producer.
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:33.480]   Really?
[00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:34.480]   Colton.
[00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:39.560]   We're specifically looking for someone to help make the kind of videos Alex makes, i.e.
[00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:43.400]   we're looking for a laptop expertise and or maker skills.
[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:47.840]   Engineering background with expertise in solid works has to be solid works specifically
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:50.720]   would be a really nice bonus as well.
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:55.280]   Also, we're looking for a data visualization specialist for the labs.
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:57.000]   Basically make our graphs better.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:03.480]   This person should have great data presentation expertise, some ability as a graphic artist
[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:06.840]   and some ability as a data analyst.
[00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:10.840]   Mr. Gary Key has written a message to our potential hires as well.
[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:13.520]   Oh, for everyone to enjoy.
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:18.000]   It's down on the bottom of what do you want to just read it at this point?
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.840]   Oh, I was looking at the wrong screen.
[00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:27.240]   If you believe you're a whoa.
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:28.760]   This will be your boss.
[00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:29.760]   Specialists.
[00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:37.040]   If you can read it, yeah, got the job.
[00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:43.400]   Then we want you for the labs with an eye for details.
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:44.720]   I got there.
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:46.840]   The eye for details took me a second.
[00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:50.160]   How are we hiring so many things right now?
[00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:53.680]   What is a project manager float plane, Luke?
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:54.840]   What's a project manager?
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:55.840]   What is this?
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:58.160]   It's a projector, man and manager.
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:00.520]   Okay, thanks, Gary Key.
[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:02.040]   Yeah, no worries.
[00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:03.040]   Okay.
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:04.920]   We're closing the back end one.
[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:06.880]   I finished writing that contract today.
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:07.880]   Accounting just needs to sign it off.
[00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:09.360]   We're closing that position.
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.000]   Let's go.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:16.640]   The project manager one is probably going to go away as well.
[00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:20.000]   But not because I found someone just because it's not really working.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   You give up.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   Okay.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.320]   Well, hey, there's time, I guess.
[00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:28.120]   There is going to be probably we're looking through current applicants.
[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:33.720]   But if that doesn't work out, we might be making another posting for a front end position
[00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:35.600]   for a float plane as well.
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:36.600]   All right.
[00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:37.600]   Yeah.
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:38.600]   How are we still?
[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:40.480]   Okay, we need to take a little break at some.
[00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:43.120]   Mine are pre-budgeted and having budgeted for a while.
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:44.120]   I know.
[00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:45.120]   Mine are good.
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:46.120]   We might alone.
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:47.120]   I know.
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:48.120]   Me, mine.
[00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:50.480]   Why do we do a couple of merge messages?
[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:51.480]   Dan hit us.
[00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:52.480]   Sure thing.
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:59.080]   Hello, LND with the end or near the end of Moore's Law.
[00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:03.760]   How do you expect to see continued generational performance improvement as the transistors
[00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:10.560]   can no longer shrink?
[00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:19.360]   You know, I just, it seems impossible.
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:20.560]   But they keep doing it.
[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:24.000]   Yeah, they keep finding some lever to turn some wheel to crank.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   Yeah.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   IPC improvements.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   Like there's, there's things that.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   Well, 3D stacking.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   Looks like it is going to be huge.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.760]   Chiplets look like they are going to be huge.
[00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:40.680]   We might find other ways to expand the amount that you're using.
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:41.680]   Yeah.
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:43.520]   Not necessarily the amount we can fit in a certain area.
[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:49.600]   Like, okay, technology like in Intel's Foveros chip where they've got, I forget, it's
[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:56.120]   like three or four different manufacturing processes and all these buses that are communicating
[00:39:56.120 --> 00:40:00.200]   with each other on this like giant package.
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:06.000]   Stuff like that is going to make its way to consumer technology or to consumer electronics
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:11.040]   at some point and could be a game changer.
[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:18.160]   I mean, the way that the way that AI is changing the game to is massive.
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:26.400]   I think that we are super mad about Nvidia giving us underpowered gaming chips at a price
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:28.960]   that isn't palatable right now.
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:35.760]   But when we look back, so 10 years from now, when we're playing photo realistic games at,
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:41.400]   you know, 300 frames per second or whatever on chips that fundamentally haven't changed
[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:48.120]   nearly as much as the 10 years prior, we're going to be looking at it going, wow, that
[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:49.920]   they were way ahead.
[00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:57.680]   And that was early teething pain for what was ultimately going to be the future.
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:06.200]   I mean, just looking at the way that, man, I was looking at this new Photoshop feature
[00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:11.840]   where you basically just give it an image and then just tell it like, oh, yeah, I want
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:15.880]   a lake in the middle and I want a car and I want a cloud that's shaped like the car.
[00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:17.120]   You saw the same article I did.
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:21.000]   Yeah, I was I meant to send it to our thumbnail designer, but I forgot.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   Yeah.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   I'm sure there already.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.160]   So Photoshop just has generative AI built in.
[00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:29.800]   And if we're doing that in Photoshop now, then give it a little bit more time and we'll
[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:35.120]   be doing that in real time in games, you know, you'll be able to mod a game by simply typing
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:36.440]   in a prompt.
[00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:43.480]   Okay, I want to play Super Mario World, but all of the all of the koopas are procedurally
[00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:48.520]   generated games are going to be a whole little faces with mustaches ball wax.
[00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:49.520]   Like that's insane.
[00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:51.480]   I don't think I've even thought about that before.
[00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:55.280]   Yeah, procedurally generated games have to pre make the assets.
[00:41:55.280 --> 00:42:02.120]   Yeah, it's just like I want to play half life too, but all the opponents are donkeys.
[00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:03.120]   And you know what?
[00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:08.040]   It's not going to be perfect, but it's going to get pretty good.
[00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:11.880]   Like you can hugely simplify the modding scene for certain things.
[00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:15.360]   You know, when they make like they made all the dragons and Skyrim into Thomas the Tank
[00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:18.480]   Engine or whatever, I didn't see that, but I love it.
[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:19.480]   It's great.
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:20.480]   It's a fantastic mod.
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:21.480]   Amazing.
[00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:25.760]   They even like when they fly when they fly in, you normally hear the dragon roar.
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:30.000]   They have a train horn.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.160]   It's very good.
[00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:32.320]   It's very good.
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:34.920]   But you could do stuff like that using this instead.
[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:37.560]   Oh, did you find it?
[00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:38.560]   Yeah.
[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:40.960]   Do you want sound?
[00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:44.880]   No, no, I don't think sound will be necessary entirely.
[00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:47.560]   So it's going to land on top of the tower that you're looking at right now.
[00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:48.560]   Right now.
[00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:49.560]   Oh, come on.
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:50.560]   It's Skyrim.
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:51.560]   Yeah.
[00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:58.000]   You see it flighter out of the background.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.400]   It's going to slam down.
[00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:09.360]   There's people who would they'd be like arachnophobic or whatever.
[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:14.120]   So they would replace all the spiders in the game with like Deddy bears or whatever else
[00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:15.120]   to.
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:16.120]   Right.
[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:18.880]   So yeah, that sort of thing is only going to get easier.
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:19.880]   Oh, so good.
[00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:20.880]   Which is great.
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:21.880]   Yeah.
[00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:22.880]   Oh, man.
[00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:29.320]   You know what would be really interesting?
[00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:31.600]   Oh, man.
[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:32.600]   I wonder if we'll get to the point.
[00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:38.720]   You know how we've been waiting for, or I have, whenever, for Skyblivian and more
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:42.600]   Blivian or more Skywind, sorry.
[00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:43.600]   There we go.
[00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:50.000]   Which are it's more wind and oblivion rebuilt in Skyrim's engine with really high resolution
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:51.480]   textures and all this other kind of stuff.
[00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:54.520]   Because you can do some pretty cool things in Skyrim's engine, even though it's pretty
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:56.520]   old.
[00:43:56.520 --> 00:44:01.680]   I think we're going to get to a certain point eventually where because of, because like,
[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:04.600]   yeah, it's going to have some issues doing this kind of stuff out of nowhere, creativity
[00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:05.600]   problems, all that kind of stuff.
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:07.080]   It pulls from something, whatever.
[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:10.840]   But you might be able to go like, okay, here's a game.
[00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:13.320]   Here's all the information I have, all the local files, all that kind of stuff.
[00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:16.760]   I want you to recreate this using UE5 or whatever.
[00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:19.160]   I want you to recreate this using this other thing.
[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:20.840]   Oh, I see what you mean.
[00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:23.320]   Because it's pretty good at like translating, right?
[00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:25.560]   Even stuff like RTX Remix.
[00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:27.880]   You know, okay.
[00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:34.400]   Just AI replace all the light sources with real point light sources.
[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:35.680]   And then you'll have to go on and tweak it.
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:39.280]   You'll still have to be a graphic designer or a game designer or whatever else.
[00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:41.280]   It's still work.
[00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:42.280]   But man.
[00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:43.280]   Yeah.
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:46.400]   It's like the generative AI in Photoshop, right?
[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:47.840]   It's not replacing artists.
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:48.840]   Yeah.
[00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:50.240]   We still need an artist to do that.
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:53.680]   I mean, all the same people that do all the same stuff, it just makes their job easier.
[00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:57.200]   Well, more realistically, it makes it so they have to do more of it.
[00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:58.200]   But yeah.
[00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:03.880]   Because that's what working here is like, there's always going to be stuff to do that
[00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:05.880]   is never a concern.
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:09.720]   I mean, that's what work is like, Luke.
[00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:14.480]   I don't make the freaking, I was reading an article.
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:16.640]   They surveyed a bad way to be clear.
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:22.360]   They surveyed a bunch of Gen Z and millennial people who have sort of pioneered this concept
[00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:29.560]   of it's called lying flat in China or quiet quitting in North America of, you know, their
[00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:34.120]   top priorities being work-life balance as opposed to all these other things.
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:39.040]   And then when they continue asking them questions, they're like, okay, right.
[00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:42.200]   But is that a thing?
[00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:44.440]   And they're like, no.
[00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:47.560]   No, actually I have a second job of hustling because...
[00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:49.360]   You get bored.
[00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:54.640]   Well, no, no, it's just inflation's out of control.
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:56.640]   It's not actually feasible.
[00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:57.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:45:57.640 --> 00:45:59.880]   You have to bust your butt.
[00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:06.400]   And so it's this sort of aspirational thing.
[00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:09.080]   I don't know.
[00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:10.080]   It's a big challenge.
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:15.840]   It's one of those things where I feel like we do, I think, a pretty good job of trying
[00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:24.240]   to make it so that people don't have to work outside their 40 hours.
[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:25.240]   But it's tough right now.
[00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:31.120]   By and large, the way the world's going right now, it's not like that.
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:36.320]   It has shifted from an employee's market to an employer's market, like looking at what's
[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:42.200]   going on with the big tech firms and the way that they're bringing everyone back to office,
[00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:48.600]   cutting perks, laying off literally thousands, sometimes tens of thousands of staff.
[00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:52.560]   Ostevea recently have a certain excessively rich person.
[00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:53.560]   And it was like...
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:54.920]   How much is a banana?
[00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:55.920]   If we...
[00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:56.920]   No, something else.
[00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:57.920]   That was really funny.
[00:46:57.920 --> 00:46:58.920]   That was really funny.
[00:46:58.920 --> 00:46:59.920]   Very funny.
[00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:04.380]   But no, they were like, "Okay, if we take this person's net wealth in single American dollar
[00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:07.800]   bills, so like one US dollar, because I know a lot of other countries don't have that,
[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:09.360]   so I'm making sure you know."
[00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:13.320]   And we stacked it horizontally and tried to wrap around the world.
[00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:14.320]   Yeah.
[00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:15.320]   How many times?
[00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:16.320]   How far do we get?
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:17.560]   Single US dollar bills.
[00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:18.960]   Like the whids.
[00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:19.960]   Almost, yeah.
[00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:20.960]   Pressed against each other.
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:21.960]   Right, okay.
[00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:23.200]   You almost make it the whole way around the world.
[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:24.200]   Wow.
[00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:25.200]   Like...
[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:28.320]   Does this make any sense?
[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:29.480]   Like, I don't know.
[00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:30.480]   Anyways, sorry.
[00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:32.040]   I'm gonna get back on the tech topics.
[00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:36.360]   Oh, no, I think we're supposed to actually do a couple more merch messages.
[00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:40.360]   Yeah, give us a merch message anyway.
[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:41.360]   Yeah.
[00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:42.360]   Come on.
[00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:43.360]   Give us a merch message.
[00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:44.360]   Okay.
[00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:45.360]   This one's from Jordan.
[00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:46.920]   What's the longest you have ever worked in one shift?
[00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:49.600]   Oh, I mean, there was...
[00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:51.960]   I knew that would get a giggle from Luke.
[00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:53.200]   Peanut butter crackers?
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:55.200]   700 series launch.
[00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:56.200]   700 series launch.
[00:47:56.200 --> 00:48:00.640]   I'm pretty sure I was awake for like four days.
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:01.480]   See, I don't know.
[00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:05.360]   I've done some pretty dumb stuff too.
[00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:07.400]   It depends on how we define work.
[00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:14.240]   Like we didn't use to classify sitting on a plane as work, but we apparently do now.
[00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:17.360]   Yeah, it's complicated.
[00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:18.360]   Yeah.
[00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:21.240]   Yeah, it's complicated.
[00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:26.560]   But I remember when David and I and someone from the business team came with us.
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:27.640]   I can't remember.
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:31.960]   But we went to and from Germany in like 30 hours, like doorstep to doorstep.
[00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:32.960]   I remember this.
[00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:33.960]   Yeah.
[00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:36.800]   So that wasn't technically one shift, but good gravy.
[00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:37.800]   Was that ever intense?
[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:41.480]   Because that's like an 11 hour flight or something like that or like nine hour flight.
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:43.280]   I can't remember exactly how long it is.
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:44.880]   We shot a video on the other side.
[00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:50.520]   Like we, like we worked and then we were back.
[00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:54.120]   Just touching go trips can be pretty exhausting.
[00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:55.120]   Yeah.
[00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:56.120]   Yeah.
[00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:57.120]   Yeah.
[00:48:57.120 --> 00:49:04.920]   I think that trip to Germany was probably my worst.
[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:09.160]   The worst recently was what we went through with the channel hijacking though, I think.
[00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:11.480]   It hasn't been that bad in a while.
[00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:12.480]   We try.
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:13.800]   We actually try.
[00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:16.640]   People are constantly, why do you have so many people on staff?
[00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:17.640]   Because we're trying.
[00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:19.720]   Because we are actually trying.
[00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:20.720]   Yeah.
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:21.720]   It's not always easy.
[00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:23.720]   They enjoy that one.
[00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:26.280]   Because this is my, this is, I'm broken.
[00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:31.440]   And this is my problem because you're like talking about how that's a victory.
[00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:34.200]   But for me, those are all like my favorite memories.
[00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:35.200]   Yeah.
[00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:37.680]   But then I have to remember that that's not normal.
[00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:38.680]   That's not realistic.
[00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:42.120]   So I, or that because I will break.
[00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:44.680]   So I have to like, but I enjoy those.
[00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:46.720]   So I kind of like it when it happens sometimes.
[00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:47.720]   Yeah.
[00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:51.560]   Like it probably shouldn't happen too often or I'll, I'm old now.
[00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:52.600]   I can't do that all the time.
[00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:53.600]   But I do like the most.
[00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:54.600]   You're old.
[00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:55.600]   I'm getting there.
[00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:56.600]   I'm getting there.
[00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:58.560]   I'm starting to feel it.
[00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:00.720]   The recovery time from things is getting long.
[00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:01.720]   Oh yeah.
[00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:02.720]   Oh yeah.
[00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:03.720]   It doesn't get better.
[00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:04.720]   That's the main thing that I'm noticing.
[00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:10.400]   I'm not a lot else is really that, you know, but if I, if I go too far, it's like, okay,
[00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:11.400]   I need to rest.
[00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:14.120]   I'll be like, I'll be good in like a day.
[00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:15.920]   And then it's like a week passes.
[00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:17.480]   And I'm like, I'm still feeling it.
[00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:18.480]   Yep.
[00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:19.480]   Yep.
[00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:21.760]   Yeah, it's not, it's not going to get better from here on out.
[00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:22.920]   I'll tell you that much.
[00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:25.400]   30s rough, 35s worse.
[00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:26.400]   Nice.
[00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:33.800]   I had my, my badminton training session last night, my Thursday night session.
[00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:38.280]   I didn't message you this because Luke was messaging me the week prior, I think, telling
[00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:41.000]   me how much water he drank at one of his things.
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:48.520]   So in two hours and 20 minutes, I drank two and a half of these.
[00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:51.760]   That is 100 ounces of water.
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:52.840]   And let me put it this way.
[00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:55.800]   I didn't go pee.
[00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:59.000]   I am fucking annihilated right now.
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:02.880]   I'm like, I am so sore and so tired.
[00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:05.000]   I don't know what he was trying to do to me.
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   I told him.
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:10.960]   I was like, David, I'm going to Taiwan to play badminton every day.
[00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:13.200]   And cover a trade show.
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:19.280]   Why are we doing all smash practice today?
[00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:22.240]   We've been planning this video for a long time and things just keep coming up, but we
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:24.960]   will do it where we're going to go to the gym.
[00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:29.400]   And I, I at no point in time have actually known what the like point was or what we're
[00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:31.800]   like actually supposed to do.
[00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:37.440]   So I've had, I've just in my head, I've had these various ideas for like a while, just
[00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:39.720]   different like, ah, maybe we'll do this.
[00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:40.720]   Maybe we'll do that.
[00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:43.640]   And then eventually I was like, you know, I was hoping this is going to be a recurring
[00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:45.560]   thing and it's not going to be.
[00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:48.480]   So I'm just going to like, heard him.
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:49.480]   What?
[00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:54.520]   I'm just going to make it so hard that like he's just going to wake up the day and not
[00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:55.520]   be able to move.
[00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:58.920]   And then I was like, I like enjoyed this idea.
[00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:00.320]   And then I was like, no, I can't.
[00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:01.760]   Because like we're too old now.
[00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:05.920]   If we were back when we first started doing this, that would have probably been fine.
[00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:06.920]   Yeah.
[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:09.920]   And then just 10 years ago, we probably would have both been fine.
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:14.080]   But now if I do that, it's like actually going to be a problem and you'd probably make
[00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:15.080]   me do it with you.
[00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:17.640]   So we'd both just be wrecked for like ever.
[00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:20.080]   Like, okay, well, I can't do that.
[00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:21.440]   So back to the drawing board.
[00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:23.440]   It's like, all right.
[00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:24.440]   All right.
[00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:28.480]   Why don't we jump into our next topic here?
[00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:35.680]   No one wants to buy the RTX 4060 TI in spite of my best efforts after taking a back alley
[00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:44.360]   deal from NVIDIA to promote their new GPU slash S.
[00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:48.600]   NVIDIA's new RTX 4060 TI has been met with low consumer interest.
[00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:53.280]   Many retailers only ordered a few cards per store.
[00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:59.040]   And in some areas, especially Europe, they're already offering the cards for $10 to $25
[00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:01.200]   below the recommended retail price.
[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:05.480]   And this is probably because in Europe, the recommended retail prices are particularly
[00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:12.000]   brutal because NVIDIA apparently doesn't attend the XC.com school of how currency conversion
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   works.
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:19.200]   At the same time though, NVIDIA's market valuation increased by 30%.
[00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:26.520]   Yeah, 30% their stock went up in the last two days or something like that due to high
[00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:29.240]   demand for LLM chips.
[00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:35.080]   So large language model chips, like machine learning chips.
[00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:38.840]   NVIDIA don't give a f*** about gamers anymore.
[00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:44.120]   It's so annoying because like, yeah, they had crypto stuff and then that sort of died.
[00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:46.640]   And we were like, yeah, come back to us.
[00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:48.120]   Come crawling back, baby.
[00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:51.280]   They're back for like, what, not even a year?
[00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:54.400]   And they're like, Oh, new wave to ride.
[00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:55.400]   Let's go.
[00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:58.640]   Like, Oh, come on.
[00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:02.600]   Oh, well.
[00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:12.240]   Anyway, AMD, of course, dropped prices on the 7600 XT down to 269, only 36 hours before
[00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:13.240]   launch.
[00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:15.880]   Okay, I'd actually like to talk about that.
[00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:21.120]   We had a whole stick for that video where the intro was going to be AMD.
[00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:26.120]   I'd be happy to help you learn how to benchmark GPU so that you can price your cards appropriately.
[00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:27.920]   And we actually left in part of it.
[00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:29.840]   And then we kind of went records.
[00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:37.760]   Uh, AMD changed the price of the card.
[00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:43.960]   If all I don't want us to get too good guy AMD about them bringing this card out at a
[00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:46.920]   price that is somewhat reasonable.
[00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:52.200]   Because it's somewhat reasonable because, yeah, a it's only somewhat reasonable.
[00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:57.080]   It's in line with the rest of their lineup, which they did, you know, get aggressive on
[00:54:57.080 --> 00:55:02.600]   a little bit, but that's only to, you know, deal with the fact that GPU demand is apparently
[00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:05.200]   like at a historic low right now or something like that.
[00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:08.520]   Like that this is not out of the goodness of their hearts.
[00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:14.280]   And be they only did it at the last second.
[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:22.920]   Like, very last second, changing the price of a GPU a day and a half before it's, it's
[00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:31.240]   public launch is a colossal undertaking because they have to basically redo all the contracts
[00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:33.480]   that they have with their board partners.
[00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:34.480]   Right.
[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:39.000]   They have to, they have to go and do it like a whole bunch of paperwork and I mean, I
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:42.560]   mean, I imagine the accounting department would absolutely hate this.
[00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:43.560]   Right.
[00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:48.920]   Um, and I want us to not lose track of the fact that if they were able to price it at
[00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:58.600]   two 69, 36 hours from launch, they could have priced it at two 69 36 days from launch.
[00:55:58.600 --> 00:56:04.000]   There is nothing about the cost of this card that necessitated the two 99 price that they
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:07.920]   originally announced to the press.
[00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:10.280]   Nothing clearly.
[00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:16.480]   And it was only due to some kind of probably intense pressure that they would have made
[00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:21.200]   a last minute change like this.
[00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:23.800]   So I'm, I'm annoyed.
[00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:26.120]   I find it extremely disrespectful.
[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:31.920]   They're like, good guy by association because the other guy's worse.
[00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:32.920]   Yeah.
[00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:37.200]   Well, it's more just like they could have just done this.
[00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:40.360]   They could have, they could have been, you know, pro consumer.
[00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:44.840]   They could have cared about consumer value in the first place and they could have had
[00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:48.160]   it at a good price, but they didn't.
[00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:54.040]   There's clearly a lot of internal forces at AMD that wanted this card to be priced as
[00:56:54.040 --> 00:56:57.160]   high as the market could possibly bear.
[00:56:57.160 --> 00:57:01.960]   And it was only at the last second that they ultimately made the decision to back down.
[00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:07.320]   And it's extremely disrespectful to everyone else who's involved in the launch of a product
[00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:09.560]   like this, including media partners.
[00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:13.160]   And I know there's going to be the people out there who's takes, you know what?
[00:57:13.160 --> 00:57:17.640]   Yeah, maybe I will just start shadow banning because they're phenomenally stupid, but
[00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:24.400]   whose takes on this are going to be, oh, wow, complaining about free GPUs.
[00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:26.560]   Do you think I need a 7,600 XT?
[00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:30.240]   Do you think that meaningfully changes my life?
[00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:37.840]   This is, this is our, our job is to make these reviews so that people know what to buy.
[00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:39.240]   That's, that's the whole point.
[00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:43.120]   And then the way that that symbiotic relationship works with the manufacturers is if they
[00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:48.700]   make a good product, then as long as we are independent and trusted, that will dramatically
[00:57:48.700 --> 00:57:50.920]   improve their sales.
[00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:54.640]   And the second we're not independent and trusted, it will have no impact whatsoever.
[00:57:54.640 --> 00:58:01.880]   So it's in their interest to support an independent media, right?
[00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:07.240]   And so when they don't give us the tools to do our jobs properly, well, it's disrespectful
[00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:08.240]   to us.
[00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:10.200]   And it's also disrespectful to you guys.
[00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:15.680]   There was a not insignificant probability that if any outlet, you know, had a family
[00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:21.360]   emergency or something like that, they wouldn't be able to get the proper message out to their
[00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:22.360]   viewers.
[00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:26.880]   Now the good news is that for any written outlet, a price change is theoretically pretty
[00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:28.680]   easy to adjust.
[00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:36.840]   You just kind of go, oh, okay, control H 299, uh, 269 have a replace.
[00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:43.040]   But because it's so dramatically changed the value proposition of this card, which is a
[00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:49.440]   value tier card, I wouldn't say budget, but definitely it's, it's about the value.
[00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:53.440]   You're not buying a 7,600 XT because you're going for the utmost in performance.
[00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:55.640]   You want bang for the buck, right?
[00:58:55.640 --> 00:59:02.560]   And it changed, it changed the angle of the video a lot.
[00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:05.760]   And for video, that's even harder to adjust because you need to change the script, then
[00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:06.760]   you need to reshoot it.
[00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:08.680]   So I really had to fully reshoot that video.
[00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:13.960]   The only reason that we reused some of our original shoot was because I just kind of
[00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:21.280]   thought it was funny to have my outfit changed sporadically throughout the video.
[00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:24.560]   Um, yeah, yeah, okay.
[00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:25.560]   Oh, okay.
[00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:26.560]   This is great.
[00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:29.320]   In our, in our notes here, it says communication of the drop was scattered and some reviews
[00:59:29.320 --> 00:59:35.280]   did actually go up based on the original price, which is not a proper service to, to you,
[00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:36.280]   the viewer.
[00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:41.480]   Uh, AMD's board partners seem to have stuck with the 270 price with the exception of the
[00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:44.600]   ROG Strix OC edition at $340.
[00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:49.600]   Um, and then Best Buy has made the interesting choice to price multiple models of the 7,600
[00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:50.600]   at 380.
[00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:55.880]   And that's probably because they haven't actually gotten written signed confirmation of any kind
[00:59:55.880 --> 01:00:00.800]   of rebates that they might be getting on these cards that they probably got allocation
[01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:04.840]   of completely sight unseen, not knowing what the pricing was, or they got the original
[01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:06.240]   pricing only for it to change.
[01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:14.280]   Later, uh, Intel apparently though, took the opportunity to slash the a 750 to 199.
[01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:17.560]   That's actually, um, a pretty interesting price.
[01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:21.480]   AV one encoding solid 1080p performance.
[01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:27.880]   And with being able to stream, like there's a very strong argument at that price for streamers
[01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:30.360]   grabbing that just as their, their streaming card.
[01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:31.360]   Yeah.
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:32.360]   200 bucks.
[01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:35.040]   Man, that's a lot of hardware for 200 bucks.
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:41.120]   Meanwhile, meanwhile, Nvidia wants a hundred dollars for just eight gigs of the ram on that
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:42.120]   card.
[01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:49.800]   And if it doesn't sell, man, I just don't think they're going to give any Fs.
[01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:52.320]   They're so busy, the LLM cards, whatever.
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:57.280]   They're so busy selling every wafer they can book at TSMC right now.
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:58.280]   Yeah.
[01:00:58.280 --> 01:00:59.280]   Like AI startup.
[01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:00.280]   Just don't book more time.
[01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:01.280]   Yeah, who cares?
[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:06.920]   Yeah, whatever, just shift production to say to Teslas or whatever.
[01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:09.160]   Or AA, whatever they call it these days.
[01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:11.440]   I think the Tesla branding is gone, but.
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:13.240]   Was it a 4000?
[01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:14.240]   Is that right?
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:15.640]   Uh, no, I think it's something else.
[01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:17.320]   I think it's a 6000 or something like that.
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:21.080]   I can't, I can't remember anymore because it seems like they have intentionally made
[01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:25.000]   their product stack just completely intuitive.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.160]   Why did they take away the quadro name?
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:28.160]   It was so good.
[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:32.720]   Yeah, and then they had like two different generations of workstation card that had the
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:33.720]   same model.
[01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:37.520]   The only thing that they did that I didn't like was they would have like weird like best
[01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:41.240]   by exclusive generations and then skip over them for everybody else.
[01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:42.400]   That was the only thing.
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:44.360]   Basically, all the rest of it was fine.
[01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:45.760]   Just leave it alone.
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:48.280]   Oh, now Nvidia's naming is an out there.
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:49.280]   Yeah, it's a mess.
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:51.160]   That's so is AMD's for that matter.
[01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:56.840]   I have gained a renewed interest in AMD's cards because they're just a killer value right
[01:01:56.840 --> 01:02:03.640]   now from about $180 up to realistically like $450, $500.
[01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:09.480]   And so as part of that scrapyard GPU war thing where I was trying to get the best bang for
[01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:15.680]   the buck GPU for around the price of a 4060 Ti at retail, I ended up doing a bunch of
[01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:20.240]   research into AMD cards that I hadn't really paid much attention to.
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:22.880]   Their product stack is a mess.
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:29.320]   They have a 6600, a 6600 XT and then they have a 6650 XT.
[01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:32.840]   But then in the 7000 generation, they're not doing 50s.
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:37.280]   They're doing XTX for the more better one.
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:40.880]   And I'm just I'm looking at this going.
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:43.720]   What the what the hell is going on?
[01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:45.040]   Sometimes you have an XT.
[01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:46.600]   Sometimes you have a 50.
[01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:49.160]   Sometimes the XT is a huge jump.
[01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:52.200]   Sometimes the 50 is a big jump, but they're both XTs.
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:03:00.200]   I cannot wait for the lab to just have a database where I can just go, okay, get that game at
[01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:04.560]   that resolution and just show me all of them.
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:05.560]   Please.
[01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:07.080]   Lab, I'm so ready.
[01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:09.160]   I haven't I haven't told them yet.
[01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:15.000]   But one of the things that I would like for us to do, never mind GPU reviews.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:20.080]   One of the things that I would like for them to do is have enough test benches that we
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:28.520]   can run in parallel and we can basically like once a year, maybe twice a year, if we can
[01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:35.200]   make it automated enough, we just throw every card back on, run it with the latest drivers
[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:38.800]   and just have this database be up to date.
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:42.960]   So you can just compare functionally anything with a PCIe slot.
[01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:49.400]   I have I have vaguely mentioned this and I saw heart shatter.
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:50.600]   But I'm sure we'll get there eventually.
[01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:52.400]   I think it'll I just think it'll take a long time.
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:53.520]   They just need more test benches.
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:04:00.760]   I mean, if it if it gets as simple as we can use machine vision to to set up the infrastructure
[01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:03.120]   behind all that is going to be like pretty intense.
[01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:06.240]   But that sounds like videos to me.
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:11.720]   Like I said, it's very I believe we can get there.
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:13.280]   But I don't expect it soon.
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:14.280]   That's all I'm saying.
[01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:15.600]   They got they got a lot of stuff going on.
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:19.480]   There's a lot of moving parts in that their lab.
[01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:20.480]   Yeah.
[01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:23.000]   Yeah, I'm I'm excited, man.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.240]   It's going to be it's going to be awesome.
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:27.000]   It's going to ask and flip plain chat today.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:32.320]   If we would make content about cards like pretty deep into their lifecycle talking about
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:33.800]   their performance on new drivers.
[01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:38.680]   I I don't think that that's something that you're going to see very often.
[01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:42.240]   I don't think the content on LTT.
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:48.760]   But I think that's something where the lab could end up digging up, you know, cool outliers.
[01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:56.560]   Like, man, how would we train it to look for, you know, weird anomalies?
[01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:58.680]   Like, you know, hey, flag it for us.
[01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:04.000]   If this card has increased in performance by more than 20% tested it in the past.
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.560]   Yeah.
[01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:10.880]   That would help a lot because then if a test is like way outside of expected change, then
[01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:11.880]   we would know.
[01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:12.880]   Yeah, I guess so.
[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:17.320]   And we're going to have to have like weekly meetings with the lab and kind of like, okay,
[01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:18.320]   what have you tested?
[01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:20.320]   What's interesting?
[01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:26.120]   I had a meeting with James today about sort of what our what our channel strategy is going
[01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:28.640]   to look like going forward.
[01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:35.040]   And it's it's it's kind of like content kind of rolls down a hill sort of thing.
[01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:41.760]   So LTT started out as simple basic like reading the packaging unboxings essentially.
[01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:45.400]   And then it turned into more testing and reviews.
[01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:49.800]   And then it turned into bigger projects and became very personality driven.
[01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:52.480]   And now it's sort of reached a show.
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:56.720]   Yeah, I would say it's reached kind of an end game as far as that goes.
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:06:02.400]   And then we identified that there was this content gap that we were no longer filling.
[01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:04.880]   And we went, oh, okay, how about short circuit then?
[01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:08.880]   A short circuit will now do the the simple, easy, cheapo unboxed.
[01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:11.360]   Okay, no, we're going to start adding data to short circuit.
[01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:13.120]   Let's make that more like a review.
[01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:15.440]   Okay, but then what about these simple unboxings?
[01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:18.560]   Well, you know what, we're going to have data for those two and then we're going to do these
[01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:20.560]   category specific channels.
[01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:27.560]   I think you guys might be disappointed when you see the production values of these.
[01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:31.480]   Oh, yeah, we're making a video on every single power supply that ever exists.
[01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:36.360]   It might just be hands unboxing some very basic B roll.
[01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:41.600]   You might have to find a way to essentially cut these with AI and then have an editor
[01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:42.600]   go in and fix.
[01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:44.960]   There are AI video editing tools.
[01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:48.600]   Like it might be pretty basic.
[01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:54.240]   But if our goal is to, you know, have a video that could belong on every single product
[01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:59.320]   page on Newegg or something like that in the longer term here.
[01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:10.440]   Basically, how much more is there going to be for us to say about the 13500 or the 13400
[01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:12.800]   core I five?
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:20.800]   Man, I'm going to be really interested to see what we'll be able to do with a labs
[01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:27.160]   data sheet, a large language model and a writer to kind of go in and clean it up.
[01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:30.200]   That's going to need that.
[01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:37.280]   Where we basically just go, okay, feed the LLM, all the performance data and specs of this
[01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:47.080]   product and everything within $50 of it on either side and, you know, the top tier from
[01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:49.360]   that generation.
[01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:50.360]   What would it spit out?
[01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:55.240]   Would it say compared to AMD's whatever, it's like this.
[01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:59.720]   That's still 30% worse than the best Intel has to offer.
[01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:05.960]   But it, like if we gave it enough samples, like if we wrote them manually to start and
[01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:09.960]   then fed that to it, would it be able to generate anything usable?
[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:11.560]   I don't even know.
[01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:16.720]   What could be kind of interesting is eventually if we have like site analytic, like user,
[01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:22.320]   how people use the labs website analytics that are good, we could use that to fuel content
[01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:23.320]   direction.
[01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:28.880]   Like if we start noticing a ton of people start comparing some certain cards or whatever,
[01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:31.360]   we could be like, maybe content time.
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:32.360]   That's pretty cool.
[01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:33.600]   I do stuff like that.
[01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:36.080]   Okay, I'm liking that.
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:37.520]   Not yet, not yet.
[01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:38.520]   It's going to take time.
[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:39.520]   Yeah.
[01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:40.520]   That's fine.
[01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:41.520]   We've got time.
[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:42.520]   We've got money speaking of which LTT store.com.
[01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:43.520]   Yeah.
[01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:45.600]   And speaking of which our sponsors.
[01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:48.520]   The show is brought to you today by Vessi.
[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:51.960]   Are you thinking of stepping to like Linus?
[01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:57.480]   Well, instead of stepping down, you should step up with Vessi's boardwalk slip on sneakers.
[01:08:57.480 --> 01:08:58.480]   Thanks Dennis.
[01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:03.520]   With a classic design, Vessi ensures you'll be looking stylish all year round.

[01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:12.760]   And when the rain does start to fall, you'll surely appreciate their claim of 100% waterproof
[01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:14.080]   protection.
[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:19.680]   Check out the Vessi boardwalk and other styles at vessi.com/linustechtips and use code LTT

[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.040]   The show is also brought to you by Signalwire.
[01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:32.200]   Are you tired of slogging through complex code just to implement SMS voice or video
[01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:34.960]   capabilities into your projects?
[01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:38.800]   Well Signalwire makes your life easier by adding essential communications capabilities
[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:42.640]   to your applications without needing a computer science degree.
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:46.600]   Signalwire was created by the team behind Free Switch, one of the world's largest open-source
[01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:50.880]   communication platforms, and it makes it simple to add in features like interactive voice
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:54.120]   menus, call routing, speech recognition, and more.
[01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:57.720]   And if you're ever stuck, they provide 24/7 U.S.-based support.
[01:09:57.720 --> 01:10:04.000]   Get a $25 credit with code WAN25 when you sign up at Signalwire.com/WAN.
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.440]   You can use this credit to purchase phone numbers, build an interactive voice response,
[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:11.840]   register messaging campaigns, or route phone numbers to your personal phone.
[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:15.200]   The show is also brought to you by, oh, this is a super cool monitor.
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:20.080]   I am actually considering, okay, I'll read the talking points at some point, but I'm
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:24.680]   pretty close to swapping out my 120 Hertz 16x9 for this thing at home.
[01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:29.880]   I've had it on my test bench in the garage ever since we did the review.
[01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:34.920]   And every time I'm out there, I'm just like, yeah, I should just bring this inside.
[01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:37.360]   And it's dumb little things.
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:40.120]   Like, okay, some dumb, not dumb little things.
[01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:43.520]   Being able to adjust the angle is super cool.
[01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:48.800]   It's 240 Hertz instead of 120, like the one that I'm using, or it's either 120 or 144.
[01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:51.240]   Anyway, it's a little smoother.
[01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:56.040]   And a big one is that it would mean that if I want to start streaming again more regularly,
[01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:58.680]   my camera could be in a way better position.
[01:10:58.680 --> 01:10:59.680]   Yeah.
[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:04.400]   A big, big 16x9 monitor is actually not that great for webcam positioning.
[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:05.400]   Yeah.
[01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:12.200]   Anyway, sorry, talking points, blah, blah, 45-inch, 1,000-inch peak brightness, three-year warranty,
[01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:16.800]   with burn-in protection, and you can check it out at the link in the video description.
[01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:20.680]   Okay, that's not creepy at all.
[01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:21.680]   Cool.
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:23.600]   Oh my goodness.
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:24.600]   Hey, Dan.
[01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:26.600]   I'm happy to be Dan.
[01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:27.600]   Hey, Dan.
[01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:28.600]   Hey, Dan.
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:30.400]   We don't know what to do.
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:31.400]   Tell us what to do.
[01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:32.500]   Tell us what to do.
[01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:33.500]   Three merch messages.
[01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:36.400]   Okay, well, then why didn't you just read a merch message?
[01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:37.400]   Yeah.
[01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:38.400]   Dan.
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:39.400]   Yeah.
[01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:41.800]   It's going to be less effective trying to yell at it when we're in Taiwan.
[01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:42.800]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:43.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:47.040]   We're going to next week is going to be the Taiwan show.
[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:48.040]   Oh.
[01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:51.520]   Why did I think of that?
[01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:52.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:53.800]   Okay, fine.
[01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:56.600]   We'll do some merch messages if you insist.
[01:11:56.600 --> 01:11:57.600]   Okay.
[01:11:57.600 --> 01:11:58.600]   Okay.
[01:11:58.600 --> 01:11:59.600]   Okay.
[01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:02.480]   Another, Dan, has a question for the talent.
[01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:06.800]   LTX is coming soon, and with the whale land, I would like to hear your tips for traveling
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:08.400]   with land gear.
[01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:09.400]   Oh, man.
[01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:10.400]   I mean...
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:11.400]   Take the GPU out.
[01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:12.400]   You can take the GPU out.
[01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:17.800]   Never, never put your tower down below if you can avoid it.
[01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:19.000]   It's a strong argument for...
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.320]   Yeah, like in the luggage check.
[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:22.320]   Oh, wow.
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:26.360]   Like if you can, if you can small form factor it and bring your computer with you, I mean,
[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:27.360]   I would try.
[01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:28.360]   I didn't think about flying.
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:34.200]   But at the very least, take your GPU out of the system, pack it up with stuff.
[01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:36.200]   We did a video.
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:38.920]   I forgot about this.
[01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:42.960]   Um, Linus, how to pack your PC?
[01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:46.120]   Here, hold on a second.
[01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:48.360]   How to not smash your PC.
[01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:50.200]   Gaming rig packing and moving guide.
[01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:52.080]   This was...
[01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:54.080]   This must have been more than three years ago.
[01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:55.080]   Hold on.
[01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:56.080]   Just a gosh darn second here.
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:57.160]   What's the exact date on this?
[01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:58.160]   Yeah.
[01:12:58.160 --> 01:12:59.160]   July 1st, 2019.
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:04.000]   This was in the lead up to LTX the last time we did it.
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.400]   Look at this hair.
[01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:08.800]   And the whole idea was that we were going to be doing a big land, and we wanted people's
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:10.080]   computers to make it safely.
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:13.920]   So we show you guys all these ways that you can pack up your computer safely.
[01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:16.240]   Oh yeah, this stuff is really good.
[01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:17.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:21.600]   Yeah, so that's a whole video that only got a million views.
[01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:27.040]   But hey, I think we just got a nice little bump from the 500 people who are coming to
[01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:28.040]   whale land.
[01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:29.040]   Yay.
[01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:30.040]   Small bump.
[01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:31.040]   The bump.
[01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:32.040]   Alright, hit it again.
[01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:37.240]   DLL, with how much you guys work when you're lasting four to five hours, how do you manage
[01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:42.520]   a good work/family balance?
[01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:51.960]   Well, I'm supposed to be home already so that I can spend a bit of time with my wife
[01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:53.600]   before I go to the airport.
[01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:55.360]   What time's our flight?
[01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:56.360]   2 AM.
[01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:57.360]   2 AM.
[01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:59.240]   So I fly out in six hours.
[01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:01.680]   It's quite a while to get there.
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:03.080]   It's been a challenge.
[01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:04.080]   Yep.
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:08.200]   But I schedule time for family.
[01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:14.920]   So every week I go to my daughter's martial arts class with them.
[01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:18.240]   So I help participate in the class.
[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:20.720]   Also I do badminton training with my kids.
[01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:22.680]   Like I'll play with them.
[01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:27.040]   You know, whether it's like family game night or board games or movie night or whatever
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:28.040]   else.
[01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:30.800]   You know, we make sure that we do those things at least a couple of times a week when it's
[01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:31.800]   swimming on the weekend.
[01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:33.800]   Like you just have to schedule it, I think.
[01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:37.320]   This is the typical response you'll hear from busy people.
[01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:40.000]   Get it on the schedule.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:44.080]   And the funny thing about it is that like my parents were super busy but I didn't really
[01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:47.000]   think about it until I became a parent.
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:52.440]   Like you remember like, "Oh yeah, we would go to, you know, playland" or "We would do
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:54.720]   this" or "We would do that" and you think back and you get like, "Yeah, we did that
[01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:55.720]   like four times."
[01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:59.720]   Like kids' memories are funny and I think my kids think I spend a lot of time with them
[01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:00.720]   actually.
[01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:01.720]   So it's good.
[01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:07.240]   You know, bedtime stories, making sure that you kind of catch them at least once a day
[01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:08.560]   and do something with them.
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:11.280]   I think it's really important.
[01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:13.160]   My life is a lot easier.
[01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:14.160]   Don't have kids.
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:19.520]   I am hoping to have someone on a time at home though because my birds have been away
[01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:20.520]   all week.
[01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:21.800]   Have I told you this at all?
[01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:22.800]   No.
[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:25.400]   Okay, so when I was in Houston doing one of the coolest things I've ever done in my darn
[01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:29.600]   life, we boarded the birds at the vet.
[01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:30.600]   It's pretty common.
[01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:31.600]   Yeah.
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:34.600]   For people to board their birds at vets when they go away.
[01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:38.080]   Is it common for the vet to not bother taking care of their birds at all?
[01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:39.080]   Yeah.
[01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:41.240]   So there's a continuation of that story.
[01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:42.240]   Oh.
[01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:44.080]   They have mites.
[01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:45.360]   Your birds have mites.
[01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:46.600]   That they got?
[01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:47.600]   Are you sure?
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:48.600]   At the vet.
[01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:51.240]   Okay, I shouldn't joke.
[01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:52.240]   I mean.
[01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:53.240]   I'm too pissed to find it funny.
[01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:56.440]   It was pretty good but I'm very angry right now so it didn't...
[01:15:56.440 --> 01:15:58.200]   Seriously, they have vet mites.
[01:15:58.200 --> 01:15:59.200]   Yeah.
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:02.800]   We contacted the vet and they were like, "Oh, yeah."
[01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:08.320]   So we had our second infestation of mites ever in our entire history and they've been
[01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:10.160]   around for a very long time.
[01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:13.720]   This is like the worst ever and things are bad.
[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:15.840]   Bring them back and we'll take care of them.
[01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:21.120]   Scoop the blue and white one was anemic and birds are...
[01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:22.800]   You know how humans are mostly water?
[01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:23.800]   Birds mostly air.
[01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:25.720]   They have no mass to them.
[01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:28.160]   So if it's anemic...
[01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:29.160]   That's really bad.
[01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:32.120]   And they took such good care of your birds last time.
[01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:37.640]   So big concern and they're probably home right now actually.
[01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:38.640]   Okay.
[01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:42.440]   So I'm hoping to see them for so amount of time before we leave.
[01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:48.000]   Because I am a big squishy man that wants to see little tiny borb before I go away for
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:49.800]   two weeks.
[01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:52.120]   You're a good bird, dad.
[01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:54.080]   Yeah.
[01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:57.800]   I don't think I could be as attached to a bird as you seem to be to your birds.
[01:16:57.800 --> 01:16:58.800]   I don't have kids.
[01:16:58.800 --> 01:16:59.800]   Yeah.
[01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:01.440]   Well, it's one of those things where...
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:02.440]   Oh boy.
[01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:04.080]   This is going to be a hot day.
[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:05.800]   We should do the next merch message.
[01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:12.800]   As a parent, I often hear people, you know, like dog people or bird people talk about how
[01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:13.920]   much it's like kids.
[01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:14.920]   Oh no.
[01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:18.440]   And I'm just like, nope, it's an animal.
[01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:21.480]   You feel that way because you don't have kids.
[01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:25.720]   I thought I loved cats a lot.
[01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:30.320]   And now I'm like, oh, no, it's just a cat.
[01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:31.320]   Okay.
[01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:32.800]   I mean, I like my cats.
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:34.560]   And you can care about them a little.
[01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:38.360]   Maybe love them a little, but it's not the same.
[01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:41.600]   Emma and I actually have this conversation like often.
[01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:42.960]   And I'm like, no, like they're cool.
[01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:44.320]   I care about them a lot.
[01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:45.720]   I will do a lot for them.
[01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:50.840]   But you only have that much energy for your dog because...
[01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:54.200]   Yeah, no, it's just a dog.
[01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:55.200]   I'm sorry.
[01:17:55.200 --> 01:17:57.200]   And like dogs are cool.
[01:17:57.200 --> 01:17:58.200]   Super cool.
[01:17:58.200 --> 01:17:59.440]   My birds are fantastic.
[01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:00.440]   Yep.
[01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:02.000]   I love my cats.
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:03.000]   But...
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.880]   And we went through a lot.
[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:05.880]   Okay.
[01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:06.880]   Here's the fun part.
[01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:09.000]   You'll know how much I liked doing this.
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:15.040]   They sent us this huge PDF about like, okay, so you had mites because now we had mites
[01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:16.040]   in our house.
[01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:17.040]   Right.
[01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:21.600]   And we found them, my girlfriend found them because they were crawling on the blanket.
[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:23.520]   So it's not, they're not just on the birds.
[01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:25.120]   They're not just in the cage.
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:27.360]   They're now in our house.
[01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:29.360]   So it's like, this is how you deal with things.
[01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:32.640]   Now that you have mites in your house and they're like, you will effectively never get
[01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:34.640]   rid of this infestation.
[01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:36.120]   Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:40.400]   some of the reasons why are they'll get into like your couch and you can't get them out
[01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:42.160]   of your couch.
[01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:43.160]   Guess what?
[01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:46.000]   My response was, let's see how well...
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:49.000]   Mine's can usually pin me pretty well, but this one was interesting.
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.600]   So we'll see.
[01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:52.560]   To get rid of mites?
[01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:53.560]   Arson.
[01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:58.040]   Because you can't get it out of certain things.
[01:18:58.040 --> 01:19:01.880]   So like, my computer chair is right next to the cage.
[01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:03.760]   They sit literally right here.
[01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:06.560]   The couch is literally right on the other side of that.
[01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:07.920]   The solution to this.
[01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:10.080]   There's a carpet that was right beside them as well.
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:13.040]   I mean, no, you have to have just hauled it out immediately.
[01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:14.040]   Yep.
[01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:15.040]   Yeah.
[01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:17.840]   I've yeeted my couch, my computer chair, and my giant carpet.
[01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:18.840]   Thanks, vet.
[01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:21.600]   So you walk into my house and it echoes now.
[01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:22.520]   Right.
[01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:26.640]   Like I actually yeeted like half of the furniture that I own.
[01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:30.520]   And I'm going to leave on this trip and come back and have no computer chair.
[01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:31.520]   Sick.
[01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:32.840]   I have like a dining room chair.
[01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:33.840]   Like I'll be fine.
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:34.840]   Sick.
[01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:35.840]   But like...
[01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:36.840]   What a pain in the butt.
[01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:38.960]   Oh my God, I'm so annoyed.
[01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:39.960]   Anyways.
[01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:40.960]   Pain in the...
[01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:42.960]   Ah, good one.
[01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:43.960]   Okay, I get a...
[01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:47.320]   I get a courtesy chuckle for that one.
[01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:48.320]   This is great.
[01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:49.320]   That's until you?
[01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:50.320]   Bro.
[01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:51.320]   Bro.
[01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:54.960]   I think I'm going to start implementing my shadow banning.
[01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:57.520]   I got a Twitch message.
[01:19:57.520 --> 01:20:01.480]   Loving a self-reproduction of yourself is the height of hubris.
[01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:04.720]   That is actually not what a kid is.
[01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:07.680]   You're a f***ing idiot.
[01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:09.720]   Miniature Linus cloned.
[01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:11.720]   Like actually...
[01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:15.880]   Like actually your brain is bad.
[01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:17.840]   Oh.
[01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:25.160]   It's like you can't have that bad of a take because your brain couldn't possibly get there
[01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:31.920]   from a place of being remotely functional without it actually being real.
[01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:34.920]   Like that's kind of how it works.
[01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:38.480]   Oh my God.
[01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:41.480]   Oh.
[01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:43.480]   Next message.
[01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:45.480]   Is it how many more...
[01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:46.480]   Please move on.
[01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:47.480]   Please move on or we won't be.
[01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:48.480]   We will not have enough time.
[01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:49.480]   You've got ten minutes.
[01:20:49.480 --> 01:20:50.480]   Yeah, me again.
[01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:51.480]   Eight sleep.
[01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:52.480]   Should we talk about that?
[01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:53.480]   Yeah.
[01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:54.760]   You've got to talk about it at some point.
[01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:58.800]   Some viewers were upset that eight sleep, who sponsored a video last week, requires a
[01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:00.600]   mandatory subscription.
[01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:03.120]   I do want to put an asterisk on here because I've talked about eight sleep on the show
[01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:04.120]   a few times.
[01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:05.960]   I'm about how I have one and how I like it a lot.
[01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:08.840]   I'm 99.9% sure it was not a mandatory subscription.
[01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:10.080]   No, we can talk about that.
[01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:11.080]   It is.
[01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:12.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:13.280]   No, but I bought mine back then.
[01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:19.160]   So it requires a mandatory subscription for at least a year to their premium features.
[01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:23.080]   And it's really expensive just as a note to their premium features with the purchase
[01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:26.200]   of their temperature controlled mattress topper.
[01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:32.800]   The product super basic feature, heating/cooling, works without the subscription.
[01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:36.720]   There's nothing forcing users to continue to buy it after the first year.
[01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:42.480]   At our request, eight sleep has agreed to double their discount offer from $150 to $300
[01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:44.520]   to cover the cost of the subscription.
[01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:48.160]   And we've let them know that we won't be working with them moving forward unless they
[01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:53.320]   make changes to their subscription model and commit to an open source transition should
[01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:55.240]   the company go out of business.
[01:21:55.240 --> 01:21:57.360]   Hopefully that helps address things with you guys.
[01:21:57.360 --> 01:21:58.440]   I got to be honest with you.
[01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:04.560]   The reason that I didn't know this was a problem is because I'm using my eight sleep topper
[01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:10.200]   without a subscription because I looked at the features of the subscription and what I wanted
[01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:14.120]   it for and I went, "Eh, not really worth it."
[01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:16.200]   And it was optional back then.
[01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:19.880]   And I didn't realize that you had to buy the year of subscription.
[01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:22.920]   Honestly, I think they could have just messaged this better.
[01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:27.400]   If the price was just higher and it included the first year of subscription.
[01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:30.480]   Include it for you, like that's exactly.
[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:34.960]   Then I don't think anybody would have, people would have said it was expensive, but they
[01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:39.960]   wouldn't have called it evil or predatory or whatever else.
[01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:42.720]   Because it is really expensive.
[01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:45.160]   With or without the subscription, whatever, it is very expensive.
[01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:47.440]   Yeah, it's very expensive.
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:53.520]   But hey, thanks eight sleep for dealing with it in terms of how the discount code works.
[01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:54.960]   The school that they did that.
[01:22:54.960 --> 01:23:00.760]   And hopefully these guys will make a commitment to ensure that these things don't turn into
[01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:08.520]   35 pounds of just e-waste if the company were to ever go out of business.
[01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:11.640]   With that said, given how much their subscription costs, I think it'd be a real challenge for
[01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:14.200]   them to go out of business.
[01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:19.440]   But as expensive as it is, I like the product.
[01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:22.400]   And a lot of people were posting misinformation too though.
[01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:25.960]   They were saying that without the subscription, you can't use the app.
[01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:26.960]   That is not true.
[01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:27.960]   That's correct.
[01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:28.960]   I do not have to.
[01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:32.440]   I do auto pilot, which is the auto adjusting feature, right?
[01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:34.160]   I don't have a subscription.
[01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:38.640]   My phone is almost dead, so you can barely see my battery saver, screen or whatever.
[01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:41.840]   But this is my dashboard.
[01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:42.840]   That's rough.
[01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:43.840]   My temp dial.
[01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:44.840]   My temp dial.
[01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:46.920]   I get that almost every day as well.
[01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:47.920]   Definitely works.
[01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:51.600]   Oh, oh, my sleep attention score of 26.
[01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:57.360]   Yeah, well, I mean, what do you want from me?
[01:23:57.360 --> 01:24:00.160]   Yeah, I don't sleep well.
[01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:06.320]   Anyway, yeah, my temp dial works and it will adjust throughout the night, but it doesn't
[01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:08.120]   adjust based on my body temperature.
[01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:11.000]   So I just have to kind of dial it into what I like.
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:15.920]   And the challenge there is that if you are not in a temperature controlled space, like
[01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:18.320]   my house has climate control, right?
[01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:21.240]   If you're not in a temperature controlled space, then it could be a lot more important
[01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:22.840]   to have the automatic thing.
[01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:25.560]   But then presumably you aren't paying for climate control.
[01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:33.280]   So I see why people were upset and that's why we've gone to them and said, okay, look,
[01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:35.200]   here's our list of demands.
[01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:37.280]   But I also do see the value of the product.
[01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:38.280]   It's not.
[01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:41.440]   Oh, I've actually done pretty good lately.
[01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:44.120]   I've got you beat 74.
[01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:45.120]   That's very good for me.
[01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:46.120]   Wow.
[01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:47.120]   Good job, Luke.
[01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:48.120]   Thank you.
[01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:55.480]   For the last, for the last five days, I have a sleep score of 26, 41, 80, oh, 30,
[01:24:55.480 --> 01:24:58.440]   37, 44.
[01:24:58.440 --> 01:25:02.920]   And I have a full 100 from Sunday.
[01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:08.600]   Yeah, that's pretty good.
[01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:11.640]   Man, I slept till like 11 30 though.
[01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:15.520]   So that's, yeah, that explains that.
[01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:17.120]   My kids let me sleep in that day.
[01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:20.360]   Well, you want to talk about next?
[01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:21.360]   Oh, right.
[01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:26.320]   We should also talk about that other sponsor, Snafu, this week on Tech Quicky, where we
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:30.440]   had that sponsor that was like a, like a neck cooler thing.
[01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:31.840]   Oh, I heard about this.
[01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:32.840]   Okay.
[01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:35.000]   I tried it.
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:38.960]   It's like kind of cool pun intended.
[01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:40.920]   But it's a Kickstarter rate or something.
[01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:41.920]   Yeah.
[01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:45.200]   So that I didn't know.
[01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:50.880]   So I've reiterated to the team, hey, we can't really do Kickstarter and you go go stuff.
[01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:55.320]   However, the reason they let it through is not entirely stupid either.
[01:25:55.320 --> 01:26:02.120]   This is a company that basically uses crowdfunding campaigns as a marketing vehicle.
[01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:08.080]   So you know how even though we don't talk about products on Indiegogo or whatever, but
[01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:10.680]   I'm constantly covering I and EO?
[01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:14.320]   Well, their product development just happens anyway.
[01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:15.320]   Yes.
[01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:16.320]   And they use.
[01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:17.520]   It's almost like marketing at that point.
[01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:25.360]   So this company has also got a very similar history of just releasing products via crowdfunding
[01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:26.800]   campaign as a marketing vehicle.
[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:28.880]   So that's why they made the call.
[01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:34.640]   But the issue here, I think, was that there were a very random company that our viewers
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:39.960]   were not familiar with at all and therefore didn't have that trust built up at all.
[01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:43.360]   And so we got a fair amount of pushback on that and rightly so.
[01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:46.520]   Also the talking points were stupid.
[01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:48.440]   And I talked to the business team about that as well.
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:52.240]   Like one of the talking points was that the fan is AI controlled.
[01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:57.760]   And I'm like, if your fan is AI controlled, you did it wrong because you're powering an
[01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:05.720]   AI processor in your like neck cooler that should probably be using that power for cooling
[01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:10.440]   your neck and just have a simple fan curve on it, right?
[01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:16.120]   So I talked to them about how we can't just take silly talking points at face value.
[01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:20.080]   We have to make sure that we are communicating things in a way that is representative of
[01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:21.400]   the actual product.
[01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:22.600]   What does the product do?
[01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:24.760]   It cools your neck.
[01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:30.800]   It kind of feels like having like a chilly water bottle around your neck like this.
[01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:32.240]   You know what?
[01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:34.440]   I like it.
[01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:40.920]   Is it going to be the difference between going out in 45 Celsius heat and being immediately
[01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:41.920]   comfortable?
[01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:46.040]   I think it's fair if it's a company without a proven track record and it's a it's a
[01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:50.080]   Kickstarter, indiegogo level pre-order.
[01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:53.680]   I think that part's fair, but like you said, you didn't know it was that.
[01:27:53.680 --> 01:28:00.360]   So yeah, I mean, I only found out about this after it was already a controversy.
[01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:03.840]   But I think, you know what, things like this are going to happen more and more.
[01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:08.200]   And I'm just going to have to kind of get used to it as chief vision officer.
[01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:12.760]   I'm probably going to end up running damage control more often as opposed to less often
[01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:18.040]   if part of the goal here is for me to not be like hour by hour involved in absolutely
[01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:21.560]   everything that this company does because it's just it's not possible anymore.
[01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:23.440]   Theoretically, hopefully we have less though.
[01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:26.240]   Like for a change.
[01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:27.240]   Hold on.
[01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:28.240]   What were the two controversies?
[01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:31.240]   There was the okay, the eight sleep one I had something to do with, but I didn't know
[01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:35.680]   all the details and to the business teams credit, they did tell me that there was some
[01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:39.600]   kind of controversy around the subscription and I waved it away because I kind of went,
[01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:43.440]   well yeah, but like I don't know, I use it without the subscription.
[01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:44.440]   Who cares?
[01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:45.440]   Whoops.
[01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:46.440]   Right.
[01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:49.600]   But then this other one with the weird net cooler thing, I actually didn't know anything
[01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:52.520]   about it until the whole thing was done.
[01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:57.800]   And I'm just going to have to get used to it, I guess.
[01:28:57.800 --> 01:28:58.800]   Yeah.
[01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:00.520]   So we're going to make some mistakes.
[01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:01.520]   We had this conversation.
[01:29:01.520 --> 01:29:06.800]   We have this conversation today where she was talking about, I was talking about this
[01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:10.800]   thing that we're implementing and security issues around it and like who should be able
[01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:13.720]   to have what level of access to various things if you're not.
[01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:14.720]   Yeah.
[01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:21.600]   And she was kind of just thinking out loud about how it's interesting and in some ways
[01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:25.920]   difficult but in some ways good, whatever, like just kind of thinking out loud about
[01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:33.120]   the idea that it's not always just line us of on, run everything all the time anymore.
[01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:35.640]   It's weird.
[01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:36.640]   We can't.
[01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:37.640]   It's not possible.
[01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:38.640]   No.
[01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:40.560]   Just like a, I don't like almost 120 people.
[01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:42.960]   We added like two more people on Monday.
[01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:44.360]   Like what?
[01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:45.360]   Yeah.
[01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:50.040]   The, the Monday morning meeting like always has a picture in it these days.
[01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:51.520]   Like always.
[01:29:51.520 --> 01:29:54.400]   Well, you're not helping.
[01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:55.400]   No.
[01:29:55.400 --> 01:29:56.400]   Mine were all pre-approved bro.
[01:29:56.400 --> 01:30:00.560]   Mine were all pre-approved like last year.
[01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:03.280]   I don't deny it.
[01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:06.720]   Should we talk about the invisible PC setup?
[01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:08.560]   Uh, yes.
[01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:10.560]   Yes.
[01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:13.000]   Invisible mouse.
[01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:14.840]   Invisible keyboard.
[01:30:14.840 --> 01:30:18.040]   Hologram monitor.
[01:30:18.040 --> 01:30:20.640]   This channel is actually amazing.
[01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:24.240]   This is the only thing I've seen but it was awesome and I.
[01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:28.560]   Oh no, he did this like super tiny one too and specifically called me out to beat it.
[01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:30.080]   And I was like, I can't.
[01:30:30.080 --> 01:30:31.320]   What am I going to do?
[01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:34.000]   I've taken this to completely end game.
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000]   You have gone too far.
[01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:39.400]   Um, yeah, this was sick.
[01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:44.640]   I actually didn't even know that's kind of funny.
[01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:46.280]   I didn't know this was going to be in the dock.
[01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:51.640]   I watched like a short, I think on it and then was like, man, I wish I could see the
[01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:52.720]   whole thing.
[01:30:52.720 --> 01:30:55.640]   So now I need to watch the whole video.
[01:30:55.640 --> 01:30:58.440]   Okay, I see.
[01:30:58.440 --> 01:31:01.240]   So yeah, the keyboard is like embedded in the table.
[01:31:01.240 --> 01:31:05.760]   But there isn't a mouse, which is interesting because he products like that.
[01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:09.920]   He could have used the same technology for the keyboard, but I actually am happy that
[01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:14.280]   he didn't because there are limitations to it.
[01:31:14.280 --> 01:31:15.760]   Right.
[01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:18.440]   Adjustable sense.
[01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:20.360]   Oh my goodness.
[01:31:20.360 --> 01:31:21.360]   This is amazing.
[01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:25.000]   That looks so insane.
[01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:26.000]   Absolutely next.
[01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:30.960]   That looks like something from like a movie on like future tech and AI from like the early
[01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:31.960]   2000s.
[01:31:31.960 --> 01:31:32.960]   Yeah.
[01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:35.160]   You know, where they fake it, but he actually did it.
[01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:37.760]   Yeah, you guys are going to have to watch this crazy.
[01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:39.880]   You should absolutely check it out.
[01:31:39.880 --> 01:31:41.600]   That's super cool.
[01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:44.880]   All the stuff that's embedded in here, the zero gram invisible mouse.
[01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:47.120]   I love the gaming memes.
[01:31:47.120 --> 01:31:48.120]   Fantastic.
[01:31:48.120 --> 01:31:49.120]   Wow.
[01:31:49.120 --> 01:31:52.440]   Okay, I'm going to have to super cool.
[01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:55.960]   Can we can we can people post the link to that in chat or something?
[01:31:55.960 --> 01:31:56.960]   Yeah, of course.
[01:31:56.960 --> 01:31:58.360]   Oh, I mean, I can just do it.
[01:31:58.360 --> 01:31:59.360]   Cool.
[01:31:59.360 --> 01:32:00.360]   Yeah.
[01:32:00.360 --> 01:32:01.360]   Yeah, don't worry.
[01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:02.360]   I got you guys.
[01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:04.240]   I got you guys basically homeless.
[01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:06.680]   Go check out the super tiny one as well.
[01:32:06.680 --> 01:32:09.880]   I got to watch more of his stuff because that was really.
[01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:15.880]   Yeah, one of those channels like DIY perks where like he doesn't publish that much.
[01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:16.880]   So it's easy.
[01:32:16.880 --> 01:32:18.880]   I freaking love DIY perks.
[01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:19.880]   Like like that stuff.
[01:32:19.880 --> 01:32:20.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:21.880]   Yeah.
[01:32:21.880 --> 01:32:24.760]   Whereas just like they're not they're not prolific publishers like we are.
[01:32:24.760 --> 01:32:26.560]   But every time they drop, it's a banger.
[01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:27.960]   It's a banger.
[01:32:27.960 --> 01:32:29.960]   It's a banger.
[01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:31.720]   You tube chat.
[01:32:31.720 --> 01:32:33.400]   I bet it's a poor experience.
[01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:39.480]   That is not the point.
[01:32:39.480 --> 01:32:44.080]   This is why I never look at you.
[01:32:44.080 --> 01:32:45.720]   That actual unwashed masses.
[01:32:45.720 --> 01:32:46.720]   JK love you.
[01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:47.720]   You too.
[01:32:47.720 --> 01:32:48.720]   Yeah.
[01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:49.720]   At least you're not as bad as Twitch chat.
[01:32:49.720 --> 01:32:50.720]   There you go.
[01:32:50.720 --> 01:32:51.720]   Boom.
[01:32:51.720 --> 01:32:52.720]   Rose.
[01:32:52.720 --> 01:32:53.720]   Got him.
[01:32:53.720 --> 01:32:54.720]   Okay.
[01:32:54.720 --> 01:32:55.720]   Rip Cortana.
[01:32:55.720 --> 01:32:57.200]   Do we only have one went after dark?
[01:32:57.200 --> 01:32:58.600]   We have five minutes.
[01:32:58.600 --> 01:32:59.600]   Okay.
[01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:06.680]   The National Eating Disorders Association replaced their helpline with a chat bot.
[01:33:06.680 --> 01:33:12.920]   They've replaced all hotline workers and volunteers with a chat bot four days after
[01:33:12.920 --> 01:33:15.800]   the workers voted to unionize.
[01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:22.040]   If you thought AI is not coming for my job and you worked for the National Eating Disorders
[01:33:22.040 --> 01:33:27.520]   Association, you no longer think that you were objectively incorrect.
[01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:30.560]   This is absolutely mind blowing.
[01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:35.320]   And this is the leading edge.
[01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:38.920]   This is the tip of the wave that's coming.
[01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:43.720]   The hotline workers included a handful of paid staff as well as around 200 volunteers.
[01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:47.080]   The employees demands did not include pay raises.
[01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:51.600]   They asked for higher staffing levels and ongoing training to deal with staff burnout
[01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:55.040]   and ballooning wait times.
[01:33:55.040 --> 01:34:00.040]   Jeddah has used the chat bot called Tessa since February of 2022.
[01:34:00.040 --> 01:34:05.160]   It is not based on chat GPT and does not make decisions or grow.
[01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:10.160]   It follows predetermined pathways based on the knowledge of the researchers who made it.
[01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:11.440]   So this is an old school chat.
[01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:14.040]   But I went into this assuming it was an AI chat bot.
[01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:15.520]   This is an old school chat bot.
[01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:17.120]   Like the thing that helped you with your work.
[01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:18.120]   That better or worse.
[01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:19.120]   Your Lego thing.
[01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:20.560]   Probably better because like, okay.
[01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:21.960]   At least it won't hallucinate.
[01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:22.960]   Yes.
[01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:26.920]   And why I freaked out about this was remember when we had that conversation forever ago about
[01:34:26.920 --> 01:34:29.680]   the AI that convinced the dude to kill himself.
[01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:30.880]   So yeah, join them or whatever.
[01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:34.720]   I was worried that type of stuff would happen.
[01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:37.760]   But it like won't happen with this type of system.
[01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:38.760]   Yeah.
[01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:43.440]   But while many users have rated the bot as helpful, its creator has stated that it is
[01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:46.520]   not an adequate replacement for a human staff to help.
[01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:47.520]   Yeah.
[01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:49.240]   So that all sounds right.
[01:34:49.240 --> 01:34:55.840]   Oh man, helpline volunteers were asked to act as testers for the chat bot instead of
[01:34:55.840 --> 01:34:59.160]   providing one on one support to callers.
[01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:03.360]   70,000 people last year.
[01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:05.080]   So wait, what actually happened?
[01:35:05.080 --> 01:35:06.600]   Because it said they did this.
[01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:09.320]   They've been doing this since February 2022.
[01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:14.680]   So did they do this back in February of 2022 or what changed?
[01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:17.760]   No, no, they've just had it.
[01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:20.000]   Now it's just all that's available.
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:21.360]   So they just dropped everybody.
[01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:22.360]   Yeah.
[01:35:22.360 --> 01:35:23.360]   See you later.
[01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:24.360]   Wow.
[01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:26.200]   This is kind of wild.
[01:35:26.200 --> 01:35:31.680]   The Google Play Store has suspended the app down loader, a popular app for side loading
[01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:38.440]   on Android TV, following a DMCA takedown from several Israeli TV companies who complained
[01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:43.160]   that the app is capable of loading piracy websites.
[01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:49.560]   Yeah, that face is about how you should be feeling about this right now.
[01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:53.840]   Downloader is essentially a combination of a web browser and file manager that allows
[01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:58.400]   Android TV owners to easily download files from the internet onto their device.
[01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:04.120]   It can display piracy websites, yes, but only to the same degree that any other web
[01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:07.200]   browser can display piracy websites.
[01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:10.280]   So they need to remove Chrome from the Play Store.
[01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:11.760]   Yeah.
[01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:16.920]   The specific piracy site that was noted in the complaint, Sidero, Siderat, I don't know,
[01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:19.920]   has received injunctions from Israeli and US federal courts.
[01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:27.160]   However, it is still online and can still be accessed in Google Chrome.
[01:36:27.160 --> 01:36:30.680]   Prior to the takedown, downloader had been downloaded over 5 million times.
[01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:32.200]   Yo, dog, I heard you like downloading.
[01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:33.520]   So I put a downloader in your download.
[01:36:33.520 --> 01:36:35.120]   It doesn't matter.
[01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:39.200]   Google has rejected the developer's appeal to reverse the decision.
[01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:43.400]   It's still available on the Amazon App Store and the developer's own website where you
[01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:44.720]   can sideload it, I guess.
[01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:52.680]   But if it's for sideloading, can we just stop letting tech illiterate people make legal
[01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:53.920]   decisions about tech?
[01:36:53.920 --> 01:36:55.560]   Is that something we can do?
[01:36:55.560 --> 01:36:58.560]   Do we have that power?
[01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:03.720]   Then again, you let big tech be in charge of it and they're just going to walk all over
[01:37:03.720 --> 01:37:04.720]   everybody anyway.
[01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:05.720]   It's not going to be better.
[01:37:05.720 --> 01:37:06.720]   Yep.
[01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:11.520]   Oh, man, that's really stupid.
[01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:15.720]   How many points did your IQ drop?
[01:37:15.720 --> 01:37:17.760]   Just hearing this.
[01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:18.760]   What was remaining?
[01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:21.480]   I'll say.
[01:37:21.480 --> 01:37:22.480]   Let's move on.
[01:37:22.480 --> 01:37:23.480]   We don't have that much time.
[01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:24.480]   Yeah, fine.
[01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:25.480]   We have any time from the YouTube.
[01:37:25.480 --> 01:37:26.480]   We're talking about it.
[01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:31.480]   It was arrested for posting, monetizing, and posting and monetizing copyrighted content.
[01:37:31.480 --> 01:37:37.320]   The 52-year-old YouTuber was accused of uploading and monetizing a playthrough of the visual novel
[01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:43.160]   Steinsgate, My Darling's Embrace, a romantic comedy dating sim without permission from
[01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:44.240]   the developer.
[01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:48.600]   They had likewise posted videos that contained footage from anime series.
[01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:49.720]   These were not full episodes.
[01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:53.880]   They were narrated summaries condensing the material, which is a popular video genre in
[01:37:53.880 --> 01:37:54.880]   Japan.
[01:37:54.880 --> 01:38:00.000]   A primary point of contention was the relatively long duration of the videos and the fact that
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:03.440]   they contained the game's ending, meaning that they might act as a replacement for the
[01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:04.440]   original material.
[01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:05.440]   Seriously?
[01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:06.440]   Arrested.
[01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:09.440]   Bad precedent.
[01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:10.440]   Yeah.
[01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:18.440]   And this kind of seems to explain why Nintendo doesn't understand how the entire rest of
[01:38:18.440 --> 01:38:22.920]   the world views fair use because my understanding is fair use.
[01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:24.400]   Like, kind of doesn't really exist there.
[01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:25.400]   Is that?
[01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:26.400]   Yeah, I don't.
[01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:27.400]   At least not in the same way that it does here.
[01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:29.400]   I have no idea, but I don't think so.
[01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:35.360]   I have also heard some pretty intense arguments against people streaming or making Let's Plays
[01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:37.840]   or whatever of visual novels specifically.
[01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:38.840]   Is that what this was?
[01:38:38.840 --> 01:38:39.840]   Yeah.
[01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:40.840]   I was reading some, yeah.
[01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:44.280]   Oh, no, romantic comedy dating sim, but yeah.
[01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:45.280]   Oh.
[01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:46.280]   I thought it was.
[01:38:46.280 --> 01:38:48.400]   It seems to be very story driven.
[01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:49.400]   Yeah.
[01:38:49.400 --> 01:38:50.400]   Okay.
[01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:53.800]   So I'm going to go on a tangent, I guess, and just say for visual novels specifically,
[01:38:53.800 --> 01:38:58.160]   because this is a thing on like Steam and stuff, people have been pretty against it because
[01:38:58.160 --> 01:39:03.480]   you're basically live streaming, flipping the pages in a book and you're showing all
[01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:04.800]   the pages in the book.
[01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:05.800]   Right.
[01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:09.320]   Like they're actually is not any other content.
[01:39:09.320 --> 01:39:12.480]   You're not playing the game, right?
[01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:13.480]   So I don't know.
[01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:16.760]   This one sounds like it's not that, but that's just like, I know that's an argument that's
[01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:17.760]   going on.
[01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:18.760]   Yeah.
[01:39:18.760 --> 01:39:21.520]   Jake from the lab who I think lived over there for a few years says this is an interesting
[01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:27.200]   one as Japanese copyright law dictates that the owners need to aggressively defend their
[01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:30.320]   copyright, kind of like how trademark laws work here.
[01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:35.120]   So this may not actually be something that the developer, the developer necessarily wants
[01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:39.160]   to do, but if they want to keep their copyright, that's it.
[01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:45.440]   Oh, seriously, Activision shuts down community run servers for Legacy Cod.
[01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:47.240]   See you later.
[01:39:47.240 --> 01:39:48.240]   Seize and desist.
[01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:49.240]   Yeah.
[01:39:49.240 --> 01:39:53.100]   So the problem is that those community servers were the only safe way to play those games
[01:39:53.100 --> 01:39:56.900]   because Activision is not keeping their own servers up to date.
[01:39:56.900 --> 01:40:02.700]   So you can something, something attack people through Activision servers because they're
[01:40:02.700 --> 01:40:03.700]   not secure.
[01:40:03.700 --> 01:40:07.620]   I don't know all the details, but I know it's like bad and they implemented their own anti
[01:40:07.620 --> 01:40:08.860]   cheat, which is super cool.
[01:40:08.860 --> 01:40:13.220]   This is for the original modern warfare to it's like way better.
[01:40:13.220 --> 01:40:17.740]   A possible cause for their legal action is the fact that one of X lab setup guides contained
[01:40:17.740 --> 01:40:19.980]   a link to an illegal copy of the game.
[01:40:19.980 --> 01:40:20.980]   Well, that's bad.
[01:40:20.980 --> 01:40:23.420]   But then they should have just said take that down.
[01:40:23.420 --> 01:40:24.420]   Yeah.
[01:40:24.420 --> 01:40:26.260]   But then I can see why they don't want to micromanage this.
[01:40:26.260 --> 01:40:27.260]   Yep.
[01:40:27.260 --> 01:40:28.260]   Yeah, shouldn't have done that.
[01:40:28.260 --> 01:40:32.340]   So the modern warfare to steam page has seen a wave of negative reviews claiming that the
[01:40:32.340 --> 01:40:34.540]   game can no longer be safely played.
[01:40:34.540 --> 01:40:35.540]   That's true.
[01:40:35.540 --> 01:40:39.780]   Discussion questions, they're away for companies to defend their IP while allowing the community
[01:40:39.780 --> 01:40:42.860]   to take over old games if they're no longer interested in maintaining them.
[01:40:42.860 --> 01:40:48.300]   Yes, there is sort of because with Supreme commander, which is super cool, the way that
[01:40:48.300 --> 01:40:53.260]   FA forever exists, that was an IP that was no longer actively being developed, whereas
[01:40:53.260 --> 01:40:58.300]   Call of Duty is.
[01:40:58.300 --> 01:41:04.060]   So it's all fine and good as long as this, you know, X labs version of the server is good
[01:41:04.060 --> 01:41:06.860]   and nobody is getting infected or whatever.
[01:41:06.860 --> 01:41:11.100]   But as soon as they make a mistake, well, whose liability is that?
[01:41:11.100 --> 01:41:12.100]   Yeah.
[01:41:12.100 --> 01:41:14.060]   But then you shouldn't, it should be.
[01:41:14.060 --> 01:41:16.020]   Oh, it's tough.
[01:41:16.020 --> 01:41:17.500]   It's a messy topic.
[01:41:17.500 --> 01:41:21.020]   It's hairy, but they should not.
[01:41:21.020 --> 01:41:28.340]   There should be some form of recourse for them selling old games at full fat price that
[01:41:28.340 --> 01:41:30.820]   are unplayable safely.
[01:41:30.820 --> 01:41:32.300]   Well, yeah.
[01:41:32.300 --> 01:41:34.980]   For massively extended periods of time.
[01:41:34.980 --> 01:41:37.820]   I think you get like three bucks in your class action.
[01:41:37.820 --> 01:41:38.820]   Pale.
[01:41:38.820 --> 01:41:39.820]   Yeah.
[01:41:39.820 --> 01:41:40.820]   Yep.
[01:41:40.820 --> 01:41:41.820]   Yep.
[01:41:41.820 --> 01:41:44.060]   Just never matters.
[01:41:44.060 --> 01:41:46.060]   And YouTube killed stories.
[01:41:46.060 --> 01:41:52.540]   I am never getting a stories function on my foldable device because YouTube turned off
[01:41:52.540 --> 01:41:56.260]   the feature or is turning it off June 26th.
[01:41:56.260 --> 01:41:58.060]   That is the last date.
[01:41:58.060 --> 01:42:00.460]   And apparently it's because almost no one uses them.
[01:42:00.460 --> 01:42:05.180]   I mean, they got a lot of views back when, you know, they were a thing, but they want
[01:42:05.180 --> 01:42:10.700]   people to use community posts, which appear to be gaining traction and upload shorts.
[01:42:10.700 --> 01:42:11.700]   So there you have it.
[01:42:11.700 --> 01:42:13.220]   I'm never getting stories.
[01:42:13.220 --> 01:42:16.840]   And I guess that's okay because it didn't really matter except that there were some really
[01:42:16.840 --> 01:42:18.860]   cool things you could do with stories.
[01:42:18.860 --> 01:42:21.180]   Like replying to comments with a story.
[01:42:21.180 --> 01:42:24.660]   Sometimes it's not convenient to type out a thing on my phone and I'd like to just, I
[01:42:24.660 --> 01:42:28.980]   had pitch to them, Hey, how about expanding stories so that it's a feature that exists
[01:42:28.980 --> 01:42:31.980]   more like in the comments under a video.
[01:42:31.980 --> 01:42:36.820]   So, you know, a comment that got a lot of upvotes, I'd be able to just click a button
[01:42:36.820 --> 01:42:40.300]   in my creator app and record a quick response to it and it could just live there.
[01:42:40.300 --> 01:42:43.660]   Like there are absolutely cool ways that you could use stories.
[01:42:43.660 --> 01:42:47.180]   And I think that YouTube is throwing the baby out with the bathwater here a little bit.
[01:42:47.180 --> 01:42:51.460]   But hey, that's the Google way.
[01:42:51.460 --> 01:42:59.020]   Let's create two different kinds of short video and they'll compete against each other.
[01:42:59.020 --> 01:43:01.380]   But one of them is monetizable.
[01:43:01.380 --> 01:43:03.260]   So that one's gone.
[01:43:03.260 --> 01:43:05.820]   Definitely the one that's going to win.
[01:43:05.820 --> 01:43:06.820]   Yeah.
[01:43:06.820 --> 01:43:07.820]   Go.
[01:43:07.820 --> 01:43:13.500]   So, the team, the number of times that they assured me that they were probably going to
[01:43:13.500 --> 01:43:17.860]   be merged and that stories wasn't going away and that they were definitely bringing the
[01:43:17.860 --> 01:43:24.580]   number of YouTube employees who have told me soon for that feature on my phone is at
[01:43:24.580 --> 01:43:25.740]   least three.
[01:43:25.740 --> 01:43:28.420]   I'm not going to name them.
[01:43:28.420 --> 01:43:29.420]   It doesn't matter.
[01:43:29.420 --> 01:43:30.420]   It's over.
[01:43:30.420 --> 01:43:34.660]   But it's at least three and you know who you are.
[01:43:34.660 --> 01:43:38.780]   The last thing I want to talk about is our 45,000 watt fan.
[01:43:38.780 --> 01:43:40.260]   Okay.
[01:43:40.260 --> 01:43:41.260]   Think about that number.
[01:43:41.260 --> 01:43:42.620]   Yeah, I know.
[01:43:42.620 --> 01:43:44.580]   45,000 watts.
[01:43:44.580 --> 01:43:45.580]   Yeah.
[01:43:45.580 --> 01:43:47.700]   I've seen it.
[01:43:47.700 --> 01:43:48.860]   Did you see it in operation?
[01:43:48.860 --> 01:43:49.860]   No.
[01:43:49.860 --> 01:43:51.900]   How long was it in operation?
[01:43:51.900 --> 01:43:53.060]   Scary.
[01:43:53.060 --> 01:43:58.340]   Probably a total of about 10, 15 minutes.
[01:43:58.340 --> 01:43:59.620]   Oh, wow.
[01:43:59.620 --> 01:44:02.020]   Because that's as long as we can power it for.
[01:44:02.020 --> 01:44:03.020]   Yeah.
[01:44:03.020 --> 01:44:09.340]   It is actually draws so much power that we could not safely power it with the entire
[01:44:09.340 --> 01:44:14.140]   output of the transformer in that unit.
[01:44:14.140 --> 01:44:18.140]   That's so insane.
[01:44:18.140 --> 01:44:21.460]   I'm just like what?
[01:44:21.460 --> 01:44:28.460]   It generates so much thrust that it could almost hover with me sitting on it.
[01:44:28.460 --> 01:44:31.460]   Wow.
[01:44:31.460 --> 01:44:34.420]   It's going to be a fun video.
[01:44:34.420 --> 01:44:37.020]   Do you know what they're used for?
[01:44:37.020 --> 01:44:38.020]   I don't know.
[01:44:38.020 --> 01:44:40.500]   Oh, we probably should have talked about that.
[01:44:40.500 --> 01:44:41.500]   Whoops.
[01:44:41.500 --> 01:44:42.500]   Okay.
[01:44:42.500 --> 01:44:44.740]   Well, maybe they have a bigger one.
[01:44:44.740 --> 01:44:48.420]   So maybe we'll talk about what they're for in the sequel.
[01:44:48.420 --> 01:44:51.540]   But we cool a computer with it, obviously.
[01:44:51.540 --> 01:44:52.540]   Yeah.
[01:44:52.540 --> 01:44:56.940]   I am genuinely interested to see what happens to the components or what you guys did to
[01:44:56.940 --> 01:44:58.820]   make it so that things wouldn't happen to them.
[01:44:58.820 --> 01:44:59.820]   Yeah, Alex.
[01:44:59.820 --> 01:45:00.820]   Either one of them.
[01:45:00.820 --> 01:45:01.820]   They're involved.
[01:45:01.820 --> 01:45:03.420]   Oh, I'm sure it's awesome.
[01:45:03.420 --> 01:45:04.420]   Completely stupid.
[01:45:04.420 --> 01:45:05.420]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:45:05.420 --> 01:45:06.420]   I'm excited.
[01:45:06.420 --> 01:45:07.420]   Okay.
[01:45:07.420 --> 01:45:08.420]   All right.
[01:45:08.420 --> 01:45:09.420]   Time for Wancho after dark.
[01:45:09.420 --> 01:45:10.420]   Pew.
[01:45:10.420 --> 01:45:11.420]   Which is not that dark anymore.
[01:45:11.420 --> 01:45:13.220]   Because we had some feedback.
[01:45:13.220 --> 01:45:14.460]   When we listened sometimes.
[01:45:14.460 --> 01:45:17.500]   When after slightly darker.
[01:45:17.500 --> 01:45:18.500]   Yeah.
[01:45:18.500 --> 01:45:20.260]   It's like barely even notice.
[01:45:20.260 --> 01:45:21.260]   Yeah.
[01:45:21.260 --> 01:45:22.260]   Yeah, that's all right.
[01:45:22.260 --> 01:45:23.260]   Good.
[01:45:23.260 --> 01:45:24.260]   Yeah, it's okay.
[01:45:24.260 --> 01:45:25.260]   Good job, Dan.
[01:45:25.260 --> 01:45:26.260]   You can tell.
[01:45:26.260 --> 01:45:27.780]   Now that was really dark when he walked right in front of the camera.
[01:45:27.780 --> 01:45:29.460]   I remember when Dan used to...
[01:45:29.460 --> 01:45:30.460]   Remember when Dan used to crawl under the door?
[01:45:30.460 --> 01:45:32.460]   He used to crawl under the camera and stuff and give it...
[01:45:32.460 --> 01:45:33.460]   Oh, his man.
[01:45:33.460 --> 01:45:37.820]   He used to have production standards and they just...
[01:45:37.820 --> 01:45:38.820]   We broke him.
[01:45:38.820 --> 01:45:39.820]   Throw him away.
[01:45:39.820 --> 01:45:41.140]   I don't want to comb my hair anymore.
[01:45:41.140 --> 01:45:42.140]   Okay.
[01:45:42.140 --> 01:45:43.700]   Merch messages, I guess.
[01:45:43.700 --> 01:45:45.420]   All right, cool.
[01:45:45.420 --> 01:45:46.900]   Sure.
[01:45:46.900 --> 01:45:48.180]   Greetings from Quebec.
[01:45:48.180 --> 01:45:53.020]   Since the warranty of my Z-Fold 3 is now over, I'm afraid to break it.
[01:45:53.020 --> 01:45:56.540]   What would you suggest as a user to keep it as long as possible?
[01:45:56.540 --> 01:46:01.820]   P.S. when ABC of a gaming in a French?
[01:46:01.820 --> 01:46:02.820]   Uh...
[01:46:02.820 --> 01:46:03.820]   Okay.
[01:46:03.820 --> 01:46:08.140]   So, what would you suggest to keep as long as possible?
[01:46:08.140 --> 01:46:12.700]   I mean, be careful with it.
[01:46:12.700 --> 01:46:21.660]   As for ABCs of gaming in French, my French, not good enough, I mean, maybe we could try
[01:46:21.660 --> 01:46:23.580]   and hire a translate meant.
[01:46:23.580 --> 01:46:29.580]   That would be a very difficult thing to translate and maintain the meter.
[01:46:29.580 --> 01:46:30.820]   Oh, yeah, because it rhymes.
[01:46:30.820 --> 01:46:32.300]   Rhymes and stuff.
[01:46:32.300 --> 01:46:33.300]   Yeah.
[01:46:33.300 --> 01:46:34.620]   Yeah, that's actually pretty rough.
[01:46:34.620 --> 01:46:41.180]   And like, there are songs that have been successfully translated from English to French
[01:46:41.180 --> 01:46:43.140]   and vice versa.
[01:46:43.140 --> 01:46:47.380]   I think that book would be really challenging, having written the English one.
[01:46:47.380 --> 01:46:48.380]   Especially...
[01:46:48.380 --> 01:46:49.380]   It's almost a whole other book.
[01:46:49.380 --> 01:46:53.980]   Well, it also just contains like technical terminology for which the literal direct translation
[01:46:53.980 --> 01:46:56.100]   is just that word.
[01:46:56.100 --> 01:46:57.100]   But like...
[01:46:57.100 --> 01:47:00.060]   Oh, French accent!
[01:47:00.060 --> 01:47:01.060]   So I...
[01:47:01.060 --> 01:47:02.060]   Sorry.
[01:47:02.060 --> 01:47:08.940]   A.J. one of our legitimately actually like, Francophone team members.
[01:47:08.940 --> 01:47:09.940]   The...
[01:47:09.940 --> 01:47:10.940]   Legitimately.
[01:47:10.940 --> 01:47:11.940]   Do we have anyone else?
[01:47:11.940 --> 01:47:12.940]   Oh, I...
[01:47:12.940 --> 01:47:13.940]   There's...
[01:47:13.940 --> 01:47:14.940]   There's other...
[01:47:14.940 --> 01:47:15.940]   A prime...
[01:47:15.940 --> 01:47:18.940]   I think that's it.
[01:47:18.940 --> 01:47:19.940]   Yeah.
[01:47:19.940 --> 01:47:20.940]   I think it's A prime and demo.
[01:47:20.940 --> 01:47:21.940]   Yeah, okay.
[01:47:21.940 --> 01:47:23.580]   All right, never mind.
[01:47:23.580 --> 01:47:24.580]   Anyway...
[01:47:24.580 --> 01:47:25.580]   No.
[01:47:25.580 --> 01:47:26.580]   Sorry.
[01:47:26.580 --> 01:47:27.580]   Antoine?
[01:47:27.580 --> 01:47:28.580]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:47:28.580 --> 01:47:29.580]   You must speak French.
[01:47:29.580 --> 01:47:30.580]   So, four, I think?
[01:47:30.580 --> 01:47:31.580]   I don't know.
[01:47:31.580 --> 01:47:32.580]   Oh, David speaks French.
[01:47:32.580 --> 01:47:33.580]   Oh, I must hear Gautier.
[01:47:33.580 --> 01:47:34.580]   Oh!
[01:47:34.580 --> 01:47:35.580]   Yeah.
[01:47:35.580 --> 01:47:36.580]   Yeah, so you'd think I would, but no.
[01:47:36.580 --> 01:47:37.580]   La frénie.
[01:47:37.580 --> 01:47:38.580]   Not even a little.
[01:47:38.580 --> 01:47:39.580]   He doesn't even know what I just said.
[01:47:39.580 --> 01:47:46.580]   No, I do, I do.
[01:47:46.580 --> 01:47:50.580]   I speak French and then my last name.
[01:47:50.580 --> 01:47:51.580]   Okay.
[01:47:51.580 --> 01:47:52.580]   I know that much.
[01:47:52.580 --> 01:47:57.580]   That's actually like brushing on the limit.
[01:47:57.580 --> 01:48:00.580]   I know Sotomous.
[01:48:00.580 --> 01:48:01.580]   Okay.
[01:48:01.580 --> 01:48:04.580]   Because it's on packages.
[01:48:04.580 --> 01:48:05.580]   All right.
[01:48:05.580 --> 01:48:06.580]   Okay.
[01:48:06.580 --> 01:48:09.180]   Because it's on packages.
[01:48:09.180 --> 01:48:10.780]   Okay, that's why.
[01:48:10.780 --> 01:48:12.180]   There's no other reason.
[01:48:12.180 --> 01:48:13.580]   Wait, like cream soda.
[01:48:13.580 --> 01:48:14.580]   Cream soda.
[01:48:14.580 --> 01:48:16.300]   I thought it was funny when I was a kid.
[01:48:16.300 --> 01:48:18.220]   How often do you even fucking drink cream soda?
[01:48:18.220 --> 01:48:20.140]   I do not remember the last time.
[01:48:20.140 --> 01:48:21.620]   But when I was a kid, I thought it was funny.
[01:48:21.620 --> 01:48:22.820]   So I remembered it.
[01:48:22.820 --> 01:48:23.820]   Okay.
[01:48:23.820 --> 01:48:24.820]   Yeah.
[01:48:24.820 --> 01:48:25.820]   That's what you retain.
[01:48:25.820 --> 01:48:26.820]   Yeah.
[01:48:26.820 --> 01:48:27.820]   Okay.
[01:48:27.820 --> 01:48:31.780]   We need to burn through some of these.
[01:48:31.780 --> 01:48:33.020]   We have like no time.
[01:48:33.020 --> 01:48:34.020]   Yeah, Luke.
[01:48:34.020 --> 01:48:36.020]   Oh, cream soda.
[01:48:36.020 --> 01:48:37.020]   Hello.
[01:48:37.020 --> 01:48:38.540]   Hello, Linus and Luke.
[01:48:38.540 --> 01:48:39.700]   Greetings from Germany.
[01:48:39.700 --> 01:48:44.500]   I always wondered if you guys got in trouble or if sponsored frowned upon you guys using
[01:48:44.500 --> 01:48:46.580]   memes in your sponsored videos.
[01:48:46.580 --> 01:48:50.540]   It means like 69 or 420.
[01:48:50.540 --> 01:48:56.820]   Every once in a while, we had a video that was sponsored by someone.
[01:48:56.820 --> 01:48:57.820]   I don't remember.
[01:48:57.820 --> 01:48:58.820]   Was it was it HP?
[01:48:58.820 --> 01:48:59.820]   I don't know.
[01:48:59.820 --> 01:49:04.180]   The product was their Z workstation 420.
[01:49:04.180 --> 01:49:08.220]   And we managed to slip a lot of pot jokes into it.
[01:49:08.220 --> 01:49:15.060]   But there was one particular shot where we actually put like a thing in the front grill
[01:49:15.060 --> 01:49:17.660]   of it and had it smoking.
[01:49:17.660 --> 01:49:23.060]   Like they had the computer smoking weed and that did not make it past in the sensors.
[01:49:23.060 --> 01:49:24.060]   Wow.
[01:49:24.060 --> 01:49:25.060]   Oh yeah.
[01:49:25.060 --> 01:49:26.060]   I remember that.
[01:49:26.060 --> 01:49:27.060]   I'm not surprised.
[01:49:27.060 --> 01:49:28.060]   Geez.
[01:49:28.060 --> 01:49:29.060]   I don't know though.
[01:49:29.060 --> 01:49:31.700]   I think sponsors know what this is.
[01:49:31.700 --> 01:49:36.340]   Like if you don't do due diligence watching a couple videos from a channel before you throw
[01:49:36.340 --> 01:49:39.140]   money at them, that's on you.
[01:49:39.140 --> 01:49:43.060]   I don't feel bad.
[01:49:43.060 --> 01:49:44.700]   Any new house videos coming soon?
[01:49:44.700 --> 01:49:47.620]   I think it's the most engaging content on the channel.
[01:49:47.620 --> 01:49:48.620]   I don't know.
[01:49:48.620 --> 01:49:53.100]   Maybe if my pool ever gets finished, speaking of which there's been a new development there.
[01:49:53.100 --> 01:49:55.140]   We've issued an ultimatum.
[01:49:55.140 --> 01:49:59.780]   They told us it was going to be two weeks to completion three weeks ago.
[01:49:59.780 --> 01:50:07.060]   We've had to reschedule our electrician four times because they keep just not showing up.
[01:50:07.060 --> 01:50:09.780]   And so we basically said, look, this is ridiculous.
[01:50:09.780 --> 01:50:14.780]   You'll be here on Monday and you will be working continuously until the project is done or
[01:50:14.780 --> 01:50:16.660]   we're going public.
[01:50:16.660 --> 01:50:17.780]   It's something I hate doing.
[01:50:17.780 --> 01:50:19.380]   I actually hate doing it.
[01:50:19.380 --> 01:50:23.580]   But this has actually been insane to the point of like should be criminal.
[01:50:23.580 --> 01:50:24.580]   No, it is.
[01:50:24.580 --> 01:50:25.580]   Oh, okay.
[01:50:25.580 --> 01:50:26.580]   In my opinion.
[01:50:26.580 --> 01:50:31.700]   I don't need any libel or whatever yet.
[01:50:31.700 --> 01:50:39.700]   But they have, in my opinion, from my experience almost certainly broken multiple laws in the
[01:50:39.700 --> 01:50:47.420]   way that they've engaged with us and they deserve, I think, to never be in business again
[01:50:47.420 --> 01:50:48.420]   at this point.
[01:50:48.420 --> 01:50:51.180]   From what I've heard, I completely agree.
[01:50:51.180 --> 01:50:59.300]   So if nothing happens on Monday, I will see you guys next Friday and I'll let you know
[01:50:59.300 --> 01:51:01.180]   how it's going.
[01:51:01.180 --> 01:51:04.900]   There's another contractor that might be willing to pick up the job.
[01:51:04.900 --> 01:51:10.660]   But from looking at another review of these guys, even apparently it took six months and
[01:51:10.660 --> 01:51:12.820]   was pulling teeth to get a small job done.
[01:51:12.820 --> 01:51:15.740]   So I don't know.
[01:51:15.740 --> 01:51:18.540]   I guess we'll see how it goes.
[01:51:18.540 --> 01:51:19.540]   Yeah.
[01:51:19.540 --> 01:51:20.540]   Yeah.
[01:51:20.540 --> 01:51:25.100]   Hey, DLL, picking up some merch for Linus Voice, my wife.
[01:51:25.100 --> 01:51:26.100]   That's not Linus Voice.
[01:51:26.100 --> 01:51:27.100]   That's Borat Voice.
[01:51:27.100 --> 01:51:28.100]   But anyway, yes.
[01:51:28.100 --> 01:51:29.820]   You're going to do it?
[01:51:29.820 --> 01:51:30.820]   No.
[01:51:30.820 --> 01:51:31.820]   Okay.
[01:51:31.820 --> 01:51:35.820]   With the growing size of LTT and improving Markbench, what steps you're taking to ensure
[01:51:35.820 --> 01:51:38.260]   GPU reviews are free of errors?
[01:51:38.260 --> 01:51:39.940]   So a couple of things we've added.
[01:51:39.940 --> 01:51:40.940]   So, okay.
[01:51:40.940 --> 01:51:47.780]   So one is as we improve our machine vision capabilities, we are expecting to be able to
[01:51:47.780 --> 01:51:54.700]   monitor not just for anomalies in our results, but also anomalies in the visuals of the
[01:51:54.700 --> 01:51:56.300]   game.
[01:51:56.300 --> 01:52:01.580]   That's something that one of our team members actually has some experience with from testing
[01:52:01.580 --> 01:52:04.860]   mobile games at his previous job.
[01:52:04.860 --> 01:52:10.460]   And in the long term, we would like to be able to evaluate the visual fidelity of features
[01:52:10.460 --> 01:52:18.940]   like DLSS or FSR as part of the way that we present performance data for these GPUs.
[01:52:18.940 --> 01:52:20.500]   That's going to take a long time.
[01:52:20.500 --> 01:52:25.380]   For now, at the very least, we've implemented a checking stage where the labs goes through
[01:52:25.380 --> 01:52:30.100]   the data and goes through the finished videos to make sure that the writing team didn't
[01:52:30.100 --> 01:52:33.300]   miss anything, not because the writing team is dumb or incompetent, but because it's often
[01:52:33.300 --> 01:52:37.140]   just crunch for these videos and things can get missed.
[01:52:37.140 --> 01:52:42.140]   Let's improve things a lot, but there's still room for us to continue to improve.
[01:52:42.140 --> 01:52:45.180]   Hey, LLD.
[01:52:45.180 --> 01:52:47.860]   Do you guys think any labs content will be at LTX?
[01:52:47.860 --> 01:52:52.300]   Personally, I'd love to see some of the stuff y'all are working on demoed.
[01:52:52.300 --> 01:52:53.900]   For example, keyboard testing.
[01:52:53.900 --> 01:52:55.140]   That's a really good question.
[01:52:55.140 --> 01:52:56.500]   And right now, the answer is no.
[01:52:56.500 --> 01:52:59.140]   I don't think we have anything planned for LTX.
[01:52:59.140 --> 01:53:02.540]   I mean, most of the labs equipment is pretty planted.
[01:53:02.540 --> 01:53:04.740]   Yeah, kind of bolted to the ground.
[01:53:04.740 --> 01:53:08.300]   Oh, yeah, I don't really know what to tell you.
[01:53:08.300 --> 01:53:09.300]   It could be interesting.
[01:53:09.300 --> 01:53:15.620]   I know like, PAX had some multi-site stuff some years.
[01:53:15.620 --> 01:53:19.820]   Could be interesting one year to have like, oh, this would be really hard.
[01:53:19.820 --> 01:53:20.980]   I don't think we could do it actually.
[01:53:20.980 --> 01:53:24.820]   Well, we're offering tours of the lab as part of LTX.
[01:53:24.820 --> 01:53:25.820]   Yeah.
[01:53:25.820 --> 01:53:26.820]   So there's that.
[01:53:26.820 --> 01:53:31.940]   I think like if we had, if you had like another event, which was like you could, you could
[01:53:31.940 --> 01:53:34.180]   go through some testing at the lab.
[01:53:34.180 --> 01:53:35.180]   Hmm.
[01:53:35.180 --> 01:53:36.980]   We're not close to there and that would be very hard.
[01:53:36.980 --> 01:53:37.980]   No, we're not.
[01:53:37.980 --> 01:53:38.980]   It might not be feasible.
[01:53:38.980 --> 01:53:40.180]   Yeah, no guarantees on that one.
[01:53:40.180 --> 01:53:43.220]   It'd be neat, but it's probably never going to happen.
[01:53:43.220 --> 01:53:44.380]   Hey, LLD.
[01:53:44.380 --> 01:53:48.220]   I often watch videos over discord, screen share with friends.
[01:53:48.220 --> 01:53:50.860]   Some sites block screen sharing in this way.
[01:53:50.860 --> 01:53:56.620]   What is your opinion of this practice, both as a consumer and as float plane executives?
[01:53:56.620 --> 01:53:59.180]   I totally get why people do it.
[01:53:59.180 --> 01:54:00.180]   Absolutely.
[01:54:00.180 --> 01:54:06.500]   And also there is absolutely ways around it.
[01:54:06.500 --> 01:54:08.900]   How would you even block that?
[01:54:08.900 --> 01:54:10.820]   I mean, there's ways to.
[01:54:10.820 --> 01:54:11.820]   Oh, right.
[01:54:11.820 --> 01:54:12.820]   Block screen capture.
[01:54:12.820 --> 01:54:13.820]   Yeah.
[01:54:13.820 --> 01:54:14.820]   Okay.
[01:54:14.820 --> 01:54:16.660]   Well, anyway, I mean, I can tell you.
[01:54:16.660 --> 01:54:19.740]   If something shows up on your screen, there is a way to capture it.
[01:54:19.740 --> 01:54:20.740]   Yeah.
[01:54:20.740 --> 01:54:24.460]   I mean, this is a tough one, right?
[01:54:24.460 --> 01:54:26.820]   Because as a consumer, I think it's super cool.
[01:54:26.820 --> 01:54:30.340]   That's one of the features that I actually pitched as something that would be really neat
[01:54:30.340 --> 01:54:35.860]   for float plane to have, like native support for.
[01:54:35.860 --> 01:54:41.020]   But I can tell you now that the creator of whatever that is is not being compensated in
[01:54:41.020 --> 01:54:43.700]   any way for whatever that is.
[01:54:43.700 --> 01:54:47.420]   So take that for what it is, right?
[01:54:47.420 --> 01:54:56.700]   If you're enjoying this content, then the idea there is that you should maybe think that
[01:54:56.700 --> 01:55:02.740]   the person who created it should be compensated in some way or not.
[01:55:02.740 --> 01:55:04.940]   And that's kind of your call, right?
[01:55:04.940 --> 01:55:06.100]   But that's what's happening.
[01:55:06.100 --> 01:55:07.260]   And that's why they block it.
[01:55:07.260 --> 01:55:12.740]   I don't think we're putting any effort into blocking it at this point in time, but we're
[01:55:12.740 --> 01:55:18.740]   also not a small creative team and we're not sort of live or die depending on whether
[01:55:18.740 --> 01:55:22.220]   we get that $100 check this month or whatever else it is, right?
[01:55:22.220 --> 01:55:24.780]   So we're quite diversified.
[01:55:24.780 --> 01:55:25.780]   Yeah.
[01:55:25.780 --> 01:55:26.780]   It's tough.
[01:55:26.780 --> 01:55:32.780]   You just got to think about what you're doing and understand the impact and make your call,
[01:55:32.780 --> 01:55:33.780]   right?
[01:55:33.780 --> 01:55:34.780]   Yep.
[01:55:34.780 --> 01:55:39.340]   Linus, what's with all the fancier, sillier, wordlier videos lately?
[01:55:39.340 --> 01:55:40.940]   I don't know.
[01:55:40.940 --> 01:55:41.940]   It's just fun.
[01:55:41.940 --> 01:55:42.940]   It's just pure fun.
[01:55:42.940 --> 01:55:45.220]   I like silly words.
[01:55:45.220 --> 01:55:47.180]   I like grabbing your attention.
[01:55:47.180 --> 01:55:49.620]   Look, it worked.
[01:55:49.620 --> 01:55:52.220]   I'm going to be in Taiwan for the next two weeks.
[01:55:52.220 --> 01:55:53.420]   I wonder why.
[01:55:53.420 --> 01:55:58.860]   Do you recommend somebody in the tech industry go to Computex for fun with their significant
[01:55:58.860 --> 01:56:00.900]   other or is it too formal?
[01:56:00.900 --> 01:56:01.900]   It's industry only.
[01:56:01.900 --> 01:56:04.740]   CES, or wait, no, is it?
[01:56:04.740 --> 01:56:05.740]   CES is.
[01:56:05.740 --> 01:56:07.500]   I can never remember.
[01:56:07.500 --> 01:56:11.500]   From pretty sure both of them, there is a way that you can buy a pass, but it's like
[01:56:11.500 --> 01:56:15.380]   really, really brutal.
[01:56:15.380 --> 01:56:17.700]   They say that I think they're in the tech industry already.
[01:56:17.700 --> 01:56:20.660]   So we can kind of like, oh, they would just go.
[01:56:20.660 --> 01:56:21.660]   You're in the tech industry.
[01:56:21.660 --> 01:56:22.660]   They don't have to go.
[01:56:22.660 --> 01:56:27.780]   I'm going to go on right now, but you're not going to Computex.
[01:56:27.780 --> 01:56:29.420]   They would go to Computex for fun.
[01:56:29.420 --> 01:56:30.420]   Oh, yeah.
[01:56:30.420 --> 01:56:31.420]   Okay.
[01:56:31.420 --> 01:56:32.420]   This is very strange.
[01:56:32.420 --> 01:56:33.420]   Oh, yeah.
[01:56:33.420 --> 01:56:34.420]   No, of course.
[01:56:34.420 --> 01:56:35.420]   Yeah.
[01:56:35.420 --> 01:56:36.420]   Computex is fun.
[01:56:36.420 --> 01:56:37.420]   It's cool.
[01:56:37.420 --> 01:56:38.420]   It is.
[01:56:38.420 --> 01:56:39.420]   Yeah, go for it.
[01:56:39.420 --> 01:56:40.420]   See you there.
[01:56:40.420 --> 01:56:42.900]   Hello, Dan and Dan's assistance to the WAN show.
[01:56:42.900 --> 01:56:47.180]   I'm using the L2D screwdriver to perform jet engine maintenance currently.
[01:56:47.180 --> 01:56:48.180]   Sick.
[01:56:48.180 --> 01:56:51.300]   Where is the most interesting place you have found your merch being used?
[01:56:51.300 --> 01:56:56.260]   I mean, there was that time that skating Olympian had our water bottle just like casually
[01:56:56.260 --> 01:56:57.260]   on TV.
[01:56:57.260 --> 01:56:58.260]   Sweet.
[01:56:58.260 --> 01:56:59.260]   Yeah.
[01:56:59.260 --> 01:57:00.260]   That was really cool.
[01:57:00.260 --> 01:57:03.860]   I'm trying to think there's got to be some other cool stuff.
[01:57:03.860 --> 01:57:07.700]   Did any of the boys at NASA have any of our merch?
[01:57:07.700 --> 01:57:08.700]   Yeah.
[01:57:08.700 --> 01:57:09.700]   Okay.
[01:57:09.700 --> 01:57:10.700]   That's cool.
[01:57:10.700 --> 01:57:14.260]   I didn't actually see it on site, but we weren't like where they were doing that type
[01:57:14.260 --> 01:57:15.260]   of stuff anyways.
[01:57:15.260 --> 01:57:16.260]   Yeah.
[01:57:16.260 --> 01:57:18.060]   That might make sense.
[01:57:18.060 --> 01:57:23.100]   But we've seen a lot of people review the screwdriver that do really cool stuff.
[01:57:23.100 --> 01:57:24.980]   We saw the guy that works on drift cars in Japan.
[01:57:24.980 --> 01:57:25.980]   Oh, yeah.
[01:57:25.980 --> 01:57:30.020]   We've seen a bunch of different people that do a bunch of random stuff that they need
[01:57:30.020 --> 01:57:31.020]   to screwdriver for.
[01:57:31.020 --> 01:57:32.020]   It's been very cool.
[01:57:32.020 --> 01:57:33.020]   Yeah.
[01:57:33.020 --> 01:57:34.020]   It's a good screwdriver.
[01:57:34.020 --> 01:57:35.020]   What can I say?
[01:57:35.020 --> 01:57:36.020]   Yeah.
[01:57:36.020 --> 01:57:39.460]   There's a bunch in potential Linus that are pretty specifically directed at you.
[01:57:39.460 --> 01:57:40.460]   Oh, yeah.
[01:57:40.460 --> 01:57:41.460]   Go for pretend.
[01:57:41.460 --> 01:57:43.460]   There's something directed at you that I've been able to answer for you, but not all
[01:57:43.460 --> 01:57:44.460]   of them.
[01:57:44.460 --> 01:57:45.460]   Okay.
[01:57:45.460 --> 01:57:51.780]   So, an LTT Labs official quality certification for specific products like USB and HDMI.
[01:57:51.780 --> 01:57:52.780]   It depends.
[01:57:52.780 --> 01:57:56.420]   We'd have to find a way to do it where it doesn't compromise the labs' vision, which
[01:57:56.420 --> 01:58:06.220]   is to be a check and a balance on these certification bodies and these product manufacturing bodies.
[01:58:06.220 --> 01:58:13.060]   I think that something like the way that 80 plus operates theoretically is really good,
[01:58:13.060 --> 01:58:24.180]   but in practice has I think been less effective over more recent years.
[01:58:24.180 --> 01:58:28.020]   I think that's where cybernetics has had an opportunity to step in and provide a more
[01:58:28.020 --> 01:58:30.620]   meaningful certification program.
[01:58:30.620 --> 01:58:33.860]   If we were going to do something, I would just want to make sure that we're only doing
[01:58:33.860 --> 01:58:40.500]   it in an area where we have the time and attention to focus on making sure that we are the
[01:58:40.500 --> 01:58:44.180]   be all and end all of standards for that particular vertical.
[01:58:44.180 --> 01:58:47.540]   And that's a really challenging thing to do.
[01:58:47.540 --> 01:58:52.060]   It's going to take a long time so I can archive that now.
[01:58:52.060 --> 01:58:53.060]   Hey, Linus.
[01:58:53.060 --> 01:58:55.460]   Love the show and all the best with your new role.
[01:58:55.460 --> 01:58:58.820]   I was wondering if there were any upcoming videos for channel Super Fun.
[01:58:58.820 --> 01:59:01.060]   Seems like it's on the back burner at the moment.
[01:59:01.060 --> 01:59:04.420]   The answer is you are right.
[01:59:04.420 --> 01:59:06.020]   It is on the back burner at the moment.
