0,2600," And welcome to the WAN show still Friday, right?"
2600,3200," Yeah."
3200,4680," Yeah, a little on the side."
4680,6560," Yeah, not for long, but I blame Luke."
6560,8680," We've got a lot of great topics for you today."
8680,11760," First and foremost being what is up with the title and headline."
11760,14000," It's because I lose."
14000,16880," Today's show is going to be pretty AI heavy."
16880,21680," So Luke is going to get to talk about AI agents gaining steam."
21680,23760," That is pretty vague."
23760,31800," And also Elon Musk pivoting Twitter to an AI everything app, whatever that means."
31800,33280," What else are we talking about today?"
33280,36800," So I'm going to announce the non AI topics and you're going to announce the AI topics."
36800,37800," I think that would be fun."
37800,44200," Microsoft could be working on a Windows handheld mode for Steam Deck alike."
44200,44960," I'm excited."
44960,45640," Are similar to that."
45640,47480," That is actually pretty interesting."
47480,50320," We'll talk more about that later though."
50320,55120," Also, do we talk about this one?"
55120,56720," Is this going to be the Elon show?"
56720,58760," No."
58760,62040," Pick anything else."
62040,64880," The 4070 release."
64880,65640," I don't know."
65640,66080," All right."
66080,66840," Which one did you pick?"
66840,91720," The show is brought to you today by JumpCloud, Goliath Technologies and SeaSonic."
91720,93720," All right."
93720,100320," Why don't we jump right into our headline topic here today, which is AI agents gaining"
100320,101320," steam."
101320,102320," Yeah."
102320,103840," Why don't I read it?"
103840,107640," And then you can spend the next 25 minutes talking about what I read."
107640,108640," Sure."
108640,111800," There's been a surge in development of AI agents."
111800,113400," Interjection."
113400,118320," These are applications that allow large language models to operate semi-autonomously by feeding"
118320,124480," prompts to themselves until they have achieved a broad general goal given to them by the"
124480,125480," user."
125480,126480," Sort of great."
126480,133080," Currently trending on GitHub is auto-GPT, which uses GPT4 to generate, prioritize, and"
133080,137840," execute tasks using plugins for internet browsing and other access."
137840,142960," It uses outside memory to keep track of what it's doing and provide context, which lets"
142960,149080," it evaluate its current situation, generate new tasks, or self-correct and add new tasks"
149080,152120," to the queue, which it then prioritizes."
152120,157200," Auto-GPT currently has a notable tendency to become distracted or confused when given"
157200,163160," complex goals, often getting caught in recursive loops and leaving tasks half finished."
163160,167760," Users have been creating tools that allow auto-GPT to perform more tasks, including one"
167760,171800," that allows it to access and use Bitcoin wallets."
171800,174920," Before I go any further, do you want to talk a little bit about AI agents?"
174920,179000," You said that my definition was not quite correct, so I invite you to give a better one."
179000,184480," Yeah, it mentioned something about them being able to just give themselves more than one"
184480,185480," prompt."
185480,186480," Yes."
186480,191360," A big part of the idea is that they can use other systems so they can use an image generator."
191360,197080," They can use some other model, whatever services that aren't even AI-based, etc."
197080,198560," They can call out to other services."
198560,201960," They don't just have to use their own stuff."
201960,205040," Also I like that we're calling them AI agents."
205040,210800," Auto-GPT has been used as a clean-ex term."
210800,215040," A lot of people have been calling all of them auto-GPT, even though there is one specific"
215040,216840," one called auto-GPT."
216840,217840," Whatever."
217840,222160," The auto-GPT name is actually really good, which is why I think that's happening."
222160,225120," Other people are calling them like baby AGI."
225120,226120," I don't like that."
226120,227120," Sorry."
227120,228120," It's not a fan of that."
228120,229120," Artificial general intelligence."
229120,233000," Yeah, but they're calling it like a baby version because it can like task out to other"
233000,236040," things and improve on itself and do stuff like that."
236040,243040," This is like the whole thing where we rebranded machine learning as AI when that's not really"
243040,244040," right."
244040,245440," That's just branding."
245440,249520," We rebranded driving assists as autopilot."
249520,250520," Yeah."
250520,254800," Like I promise we're not going to talk about him the whole show."
254800,258120," I do really like, yeah, auto-GPT is a fantastic name."
258120,259520," There's a bunch of these systems."
259520,264400," There's actually a load, like a huge amount of them because it's the trend right now."
264400,270280," In this whole space, if something catches on even slightly, you can absolutely bet there"
270280,272680," will be a ton of it almost immediately."
272680,276760," Now, you've given some examples of things that people are doing with these agents on"
276760,280620," past shows, but is there a new stuff that's come to light this week or just a refresher"
280620,284320," for those of us who right now it sounds very vague and nebulous."
284320,287680," Well, it can call to stuff and it can do things."
287680,289720," What are some of the things people are doing with this?"
289720,296000," So basically with current, with what most people currently have access to if all they"
296000,301320," do is like go to open the eyes website is GPT 4 or 3.5 or below."
301320,305760," And with that, you can usually get the steps that you would need to do to accomplish something."
305760,306760," Sure."
306760,308920," How do I build a computer?"
308920,314640," So instead of how do I build a computer and it listing steps, you could say how do I build"
314640,317880," a computer and it could actually just like order for me?"
317880,318880," Potentially."
318880,324520," If you hooked it up to the right things because like someone has actually used it to buy their"
324520,328600," groceries for the week, they're like, I need recipes for a week."
328600,330800," These are the types of things that I like."
330800,332200," This is the grocery store, whatever."
332200,337200," They hooked it up to some grocery delivery service that I don't remember the name of."
337200,342400," It actually purchased the groceries and made it so that like, oh, you bought a can of this,"
342400,344760," you only need X amount of it for one meal."
344760,346240," But I picked a different meal."
346240,349400," So you're not eating the same thing all the time that will use the rest of it in order"
349400,350400," to be efficient."
350400,354560," Like it did all this stuff that was really, really good."
354560,356280," It planned their meals for the week."
356280,357840," It ordered everything for them."
357840,362600," It gave them recipes for all of the meals and it efficiently used the ingredients."
362600,369600," Do you remember when microtransactions took off in mobile games and every other flippin'"
369600,370600," win show?"
370600,375840," We were talking about some kid going to town on mom or dad's credit card, buying a bunch"
375840,384520," of jewels or twitch bits or whatever else it is, racking up thousands of adults."
384520,390520," How long is it going to be before someone sues OpenAI for chat GPT, spending a whole"
390520,395120," bunch of their money when they were the ones who were irresponsible enough to give it their"
395120,396120," credit card?"
396120,397560," Oh, it's going to be a problem."
397560,400440," You mentioned in here connecting it to Bitcoin wallets, right?"
400440,401440," Yeah."
401440,406800," Well, people are using that to use GPT-style models to bet on markets for them."
406800,407800," Oh, no."
407800,409520," That is 100% already happening."
409520,419040," There is even these websites where you can get like auto trading bots for like coin exchanges."
419040,423120," And they already have like you can build your own bot using GPT models and give it its"
423120,428080," own weights and everything using that instead of needing to code it yourself, etc."
428080,430560," Yeah, it's getting pretty nuts."
430560,436720," I was reading one thread on a person who spent, I think it was like, I think they said roughly"
436720,443440," eight hours like tuning things in and whatnot, working with, I believe it was auto GPT specifically,"
443440,445640," but I don't fully remember."
445640,449600," And they made a tool, I don't remember what the tool did, but they got like a thousand"
449600,454320," users for their tool and were able to sell their like startup company all within like"
454320,458840," a week, which is just, that's crazy."
458840,462560," Yeah, people are also talking about, I forget who I was talking to, but they were saying"
462560,467840," they know of someone who basically gave it a little bit of money and said, go build an"
467840,473160," online business, it built it, got like what, a thousand users or something like that and"
473160,476320," some obscenely short period of time and then sold it."
476320,477320," Yep."
477320,484120," There's also, someone has actually even just asked it, get me money without giving it"
484120,485360," any money."
485360,489280," And what it did is it like asked them for some of their like personal details and stuff"
489280,498200," and it scraped government websites and it scraped websites that do, and what is it called when"
498200,502760," there's like a lawsuit or something, you like bought a product and you get calls."
502760,503760," Or like a class action."
503760,504760," You get money back."
504760,505760," Yeah."
505760,511320," So it's great like class action lawsuit things and it grabbed everything it could for them,"
511320,515440," like different grants from government because of whatever details about the person and whatever"
515440,519640," class action lawsuits they were eligible to get money from, et cetera, et cetera, et"
519640,520640," cetera."
520640,522040," And it made them like a few hundred bucks."
522040,524840," Like it wasn't even that small of an amount of money."
524840,525840," Unbelievable."
525840,526840," Yeah."
526840,529240," There's a really cool experiment."
529240,531400," Do you want to keep reading or do you want me to do it?"
531400,532400," Sure."
532400,533400," But you know what?"
533400,536800," You just, my brain is tired."
536800,541620," Stanford and Google researchers have been performing a series of, this is wild to me."
541620,546240," We were actually talking last week about AI integration into games and how it might be"
546240,547240," able to go."
547240,548240," Yeah."
548240,549240," So this is particularly very interesting."
549240,550240," Yeah."
550240,557760," He messages me this white paper like earlier this week like blah blah blah blah blah blah."
557760,560520," That's basically what message contents were."
560520,563760," It's honestly more accurate than I would like to admit."
563760,568000," Stanford and Google researchers have been performing a series of experiments with similar"
568000,574880," AI powered agents by having LLM's control 25 characters within a virtual town."
574880,579960," The characters can communicate, interact with their environment, remember events, reflect"
579960,582520," on those events and form plans."
582520,588040," Each is preloaded with a starting persona and an existing relationship with the other"
588040,590240," characters in the game."
590240,594920," So the course of several in world days, the characters engaged in a series of complex"
594920,597920," interactions based on those starting conditions."
597920,603040," Researchers told one, this is the really cool part of my opinion, researchers told one generative"
603040,608280," agent to host a Valentine's Day party without any further human intervention."
608280,612520," The character invited nine other characters who then passed on the information to four"
612520,614480," other characters beyond that."
614480,618980," The characters remembered the invitation, reorganized their daily schedule in response"
618980,627840," to it with one asking another officially on a like romantic date to the event."
627840,628840," Prove to me."
628840,629840," Whoa."
629840,632080," Now that we are not living in a simulation."
632080,633080," Oh, boy."
633080,636760," We're doing the Silicon Valley tech bro conversation."
636760,638840," You can't prove it's not a simulation."
638840,640800," Um, yeah, I don't know."
640800,644900," I think what this made immediately made me think of is like, because you were talking"
644900,649600," about how like, you want tailored conversations for your games."
649600,650600," Yeah."
650600,654200," Like you don't really want an LLM to just go in and write all the text for the game."
654200,659400," Yeah, because I want it's kind of like, okay, it's kind of like playing Breath of the"
659400,664080," Wild compared to playing a game that has an auto generated environment."
664080,670240," Like, okay, you and I, these are, these are examples that are pulled from vastly different"
670240,671240," eras of gaming."
671240,674440," So I understand that they are not directly comparable."
674440,680780," But we did a run of Diablo one, a while back, just like, you know, nighttime gaming, those"
680780,684940," generated dungeons end of all kind of being samey."
684940,685940," Yeah."
685940,690460," Like there's some difference in that you don't know what's around the next corner sort of,"
690460,694940," but there's also no flow to them."
694940,700460," Whereas exploring in Breath of the Wild, it's, it's art."
700460,701460," Yes."
701460,702460," It's artful."
702460,712440," It will stumble upon things because there was an intentful, purposeful, whatever."
712440,715820," There's a narrative direction going on."
715820,718580," There's a direction of things that you're supposed to experience when you go through"
718580,719580," different areas."
719580,725340," And AI has an issue with hallucinations as I may be I mentioned that in the pre-show."
725340,728460," Or getting distracted as you just mentioned."
728460,729460," Yeah."
729460,732420," How they can get distracted or confuse when tasks are really large."
732420,736500," Asking it with doing something that big, holding that narrative the whole way through."
736500,738220," It current versions, right."
738220,739820," Now maybe I'm wrong in two months."
739820,740820," I don't know."
740820,743420," But current versions are going to struggle with that very seriously."
743420,750180," But Skyrim style, like you need to try to make sure that all the people have jobs that"
750180,753980," they go to every day and they do stuff and they react to the world."
753980,758180," Those baseline like NPCs that aren't technically important."
758180,760420," Making environments feel populated."
760420,761420," Yes."
761420,763580," Super, super good at that."
763580,765340," Totally a different game."
765340,771500," It's just when it gets to dialogue, that's where I am really not sure about it."
771500,774980," Because I don't want them to say something different if there isn't new content for me"
774980,776460," to engage with."
776460,785620," With that said, it is a matter of time before there's a game where you are just dumped into"
785620,794940," essentially an MMO that is entirely populated with AI agents that level up and quest and"
794940,801700," have jobs and build new towns for you to explore to the point where when you go back and you"
801700,808420," re-engage, it is new stuff and things have happened and you do need to catch up on events"
808420,811820," and it's happening constantly all the time everywhere."
811820,818620," Man, when we first started talking about Stadia and cloud gaming, I didn't realize it"
818620,821700," yet, but this."
821700,826940," This is the kind of gaming experience that that should have enabled."
826940,834340," Imagine an escape from Tarkov like experience where you are warping into but instead of"
834340,843740," an instance, a persistent world and then every six months or whatever it is, you do a wipe"
843740,846340," and it's a brand new world."
846340,850340," I feel like hardcore gameplay actually benefits from this more."
850340,862420," Imagine a permadeath RPG but your effects 100% remain."
862420,866460," And I know there's like roguelikes that go in this direction already."
866460,870660," Someone already mentioned it but like SAO, yeah, if you've watched the first half season"
870660,877980," of SAO, the good part, it's kind of like the impacts of your previous character, not"
877980,883580," only are they detectable as they are sometimes in like roguelike games but they like extremely"
883580,885740," impact the world."
885740,893140," And there's this butterfly effect where someone comes in, murders the son of some AI agent"
893140,897820," baker who swears vengeance on every player character."
897820,902260," So there's like a flag put through the town, through the bread sold at the bakery."
902260,908620," And you could have all these different attributes that could even be slightly RNGed that apply"
908620,913540," to these to these NPCs and depending on how people interact with them, they could turn"
913540,921460," into like you could, oh man, like you could not even assign a big baddie to this world."
921460,922460," Yeah."
922460,928060," There could just be many potential big baddies that form."
928060,932980," There could be forms that are aligned against each other and then through natural events"
932980,939300," of them, you know, wanting to gain position on each other, big baddies just are created"
939300,941780," dynamically in the world."
941780,943540," It could be super interesting."
943540,944740," Could be super interesting."
944740,950500," Hideo Kojima apparently had the idea of a raw game."
950500,955820," This is according to a floatplane chat back in 1998."
955820,959140," And apparently it's something kind of like this."
959140,965340," Yeah, someday I can tell game developers have wanted to do this type of stuff for a long"
965340,966340," time."
966340,967580," Well, it's one of the holy grails."
967580,974340," It's like true physics based object interaction."
974340,975900," Attempts have been made."
975900,980940," And even games where it's a significant role in gameplay, whether we're talking about Rainbow"
980940,988300," Six or some of the earlier battlefield games, destructible environments, it's been done."
988300,994920," But nothing would be like a persistent environment where you can, you know, maybe not quite like"
994920,1001500," a Minecraft or Fortnite, but where you can build and also destroy realistically."
1001500,1002840," Nothing like that actually exists."
1002840,1008840," I feel like it increases how much you care about your decisions in the game because your"
1008840,1012320," decisions in the game are going to impact your next playthrough."
1012320,1017240," But in a more serious way than most games that attempt to do that right now actually"
1017240,1018240," will."
1018240,1024440," The way like the way looting in towns or encampments or whatever else would work because if those"
1024440,1031360," agents are stealing from other player characters and from each other and if there are enough"
1031360,1037880," AI agents that are working the land, you know, producing raw materials and resources, the"
1037880,1043040," world, this game world will naturally become enriched over time."
1043040,1048800," If you do the classic Legend of Zelda smash all the pots in like your favorite town, you"
1048800,1050360," could like bankrupt the town."
1050360,1055160," Oh, wow, I didn't even like think of that."
1055160,1060360," Like you're going to have to actually not be a big jerk unless that's what you want for"
1060360,1061360," the world."
1061360,1067120," Or it could be full of really good stuff because it's secret, you know, after 10 p.m."
1067120,1068680," This town is cannibal mode."
1068680,1074840," You think they're really cool, but but but they're actually like stealing and cannibalizing"
1074840,1077960," the areas around them or whatever."
1077960,1079360," Yeah."
1079360,1080360," Door fortress."
1080360,1083240," Yeah, door fortress with this would be sick."
1083240,1086280," Oh, no, they do have a persistent mode."
1086280,1089680," Yeah, there's a lot of games that have that have done these types of things."
1089680,1095880," I I'm struggling to describe what I'm I'm trying to say, but I think this is going to"
1095880,1097440," enable a new level of it."
1097440,1100560," If you know what I mean, the dark 24 and full plane chat says that would never work in"
1100560,1103280," a multiplayer game because people are trolls."
1103280,1105000," But that's the thing."
1105000,1112920," If you have an expansive enough world and enough of these AI agents, well, they're going to"
1112920,1120800," learn from the behavior that they see and you're going to create a very adversarial type"
1120800,1121920," of world."
1121920,1125840," I think what you could probably do is you could tailor the gaming experience by having"
1125840,1127680," worlds with different rules."
1127680,1135800," So the AI agents all start with the same basic alignments or the same basic resources or"
1135800,1137840," jobs or whatever else it is."
1137840,1143320," But in some worlds, you know, there's no player versus player or in some worlds, there's no"
1143320,1149400," player versus good aligned NPCs or whatever these baseline rules are."
1149400,1154080," And I think that would really that would really alter the course of the world's development"
1154080,1158200," and people could pick their playstyle based on what type of world they select to warp"
1158200,1159200," into."
1159200,1160200," Yeah."
1160200,1165640," And like if you're in a full PvP enabled world and the players do just attack everything"
1165640,1170440," all the time, it would make sense for the agents to start training themselves more aggressively"
1170440,1172600," investing in armaments, whatnot."
1172600,1173600," Yeah."
1173600,1178080," And if you created a world that had lesser resources in certain regions, well, those would be lower"
1178080,1180000," level regions."
1180000,1183120," So you could still have kind of similar to what you'd see in an MMO."
1183120,1189200," You could still have a training area where PvP is disabled and you know, all the AI agents"
1189200,1194840," are kind of centered off because you couldn't actually nerf the NPCs too far or else all the"
1194840,1197000," low level areas, which is disappear."
1197000,1198000," Yeah, exactly."
1198000,1199000," Yeah."
1199000,1201000," It's interesting."
1201000,1208040," Oh, see, what about ruining the game economy by selling too many materials into town?"
1208040,1211960," Like if you sell too much bread in a town, you could bankrupt the baker."
1211960,1215120," Some of these types of systems already exist."
1215120,1219440," But the quake impacts of them across the world."
1219440,1222480," I feel like it would be self balancing to a point, right?"
1222480,1230240," Because if there's a fixed amount of resource, anytime someone amasses too much, someone's"
1230240,1231960," going to be gunning for them."
1231960,1236360," Oh, so like you have like assassins coming after you or whatever."
1236360,1237360," Yeah."
1237360,1238360," Something like that."
1238360,1239360," Yeah."
1239360,1240840," If you have to actually cart your goods around."
1240840,1244280," Oh, that's a really interesting thing."
1244280,1250600," So you add that you just add these like these realism counterbalances to the ways that people"
1250600,1251600," will try to break the game."
1251600,1255720," And it's obviously something that will be broken in a new way every wipe."
1255720,1258320," It would have to be really, really hard."
1258320,1259320," It's the kind of game."
1259320,1260720," It would have to be like realism hard."
1260720,1263360," It's the kind of game that you could play forever."
1263360,1265120," Yeah, pretty much."
1265120,1266120," Yeah."
1266120,1270800," Anyways, the discussion questions for this topic are what are the likely applications"
1270800,1273480," and limitations of this type of technology?"
1273480,1276480," What kind of difference would it make in people's lives if they had this kind of AI"
1276480,1279120," assistant?"
1279120,1285280," The most interesting like actually use it myself, use case that I think I saw was that"
1285280,1286760," the groceries one."
1286760,1290960," Yeah, because we've talked like there's been there's been oh, this fridge will like reorder"
1290960,1294320," milk for you or whatever."
1294320,1296280," But that seems to have kind of gone away."
1296280,1298200," I don't know if it didn't work that well or what?"
1298200,1299200," I mean, probably."
1299200,1301760," But I haven't heard people talk about it in like a long time."
1301760,1302760," They're fridges."
1302760,1306080," So they were made by appliance manufacturers, which is probably true."
1306080,1310040," Tell you how good the software was."
1310040,1313960," But like I also know a lot of people that say like one of the most annoying things they"
1313960,1318280," have to do every week is like figure out what the heck they're going to eat."
1318280,1321320," So if you can just tell it like I like these things, I need groceries for a week and it"
1321320,1322560," can just figure it out for you."
1322560,1325160," I think a lot of people would just be happy with that."
1325160,1326160," I don't know."
1326160,1329160," And if it can actually order the groceries for you and they just like show up."
1329160,1333080," And then what's great is the longer you interact with it, the better it gets."
1333080,1335080," Because you can say this was great."
1335080,1336080," This was trash."
1336080,1338600," This was a seven out of 10."
1338600,1340200," This was too hard to cook."
1340200,1341480," This was too boring to cook."
1341480,1345760," If that's a metric that you care about, I don't have the right tools to cook this one."
1345760,1347920," Different things like that."
1347920,1352120," There's a lot of there's a lot of sort of media, whether it's games or movies that people"
1352120,1354440," are pointing out is similar to what we've been talking about."
1354440,1356520," It's pretty similar to the premise of free."
1356520,1357520," It's a fun stuff that's been around forever."
1357520,1358520," Yep."
1358520,1361840," The exciting right now is that there's a path to it."
1361840,1362840," Yeah."
1362840,1368440," A real realistic path to this gaming experience existing because up until now."
1368440,1371080," At levels of depth that we haven't really seen."
1371080,1377680," We've reached a point where creating a next generation gaming experience has become functionally"
1377680,1378680," impossible."
1378680,1380360," I mean, look at the budget."
1380360,1382640," Look at the time they spent on GTA 5."
1382640,1383640," Do you?"
1383640,1386960," Look at how long CD Projekt Red was working on Cyberpunk."
1386960,1391160," Look how long they've been working on the next generation Witcher game because to hand"
1391160,1399520," craft every element of the environments and interactivity and questing and items and whatever"
1399520,1404920," it is is no longer feasible if you're trying to make a bigger game than what came last."
1404920,1410360," Especially now that games as a service is such a pervasive concept within the industry"
1410360,1415480," because GTA 6 doesn't just have to be bigger than GTA 5."
1415480,1421080," It has to be bigger than GTA 5 plus the 10 flipping years of work that they've done on"
1421080,1424200," GTA 5 since they launched it."
1424200,1426080," It's actually impossible."
1426080,1427080," It's pretty ridiculous."
1427080,1428080," You can't."
1428080,1431280," You can't catch up to yourself."
1431280,1433240," There's also been running for 10 years."
1433240,1436640," There's also reward systems in games that are holding that type of stuff back."
1436640,1443320," This is a slightly different conversation but like CSGO, CSGO 2 or whatever is coming."
1443320,1446840," Don't get access because I'm not a cool streamer person."
1446840,1452800," But one of the first things in their announcement was talking about how yes, don't worry, you'll"
1452800,1455200," be able to keep your skins."
1455200,1458080," That doesn't work that great for every game."
1458080,1459960," It does work really well for Counter Strike."
1459960,1462120," But where's my oblivion horse armor now?"
1462120,1463120," Yeah."
1463120,1465000," What if the next game doesn't have horses?"
1465000,1468560," And so they don't want to create, oh yeah, you don't want to create an environment where"
1468560,1475400," people feel like, well, I would be a whale and I would spend thousands or tens of thousands"
1475400,1476400," of dollars on this game."
1476400,1479560," But there's a new one coming and I can't take my stuff with me."
1479560,1484520," And you see the kind of backlash that developers are getting from, you know, oh, well, we're"
1484520,1487880," going to do a new one and forget about your old stuff."
1487880,1489960," Oh man, shoot, who was it?"
1489960,1490960," Over?"
1490960,1491960," Not Overwatch."
1491960,1492960," No."
1492960,1503600," The new version coming old version turned off game."
1503600,1504600," Hold on."
1504600,1505600," Crap."
1505600,1507320," That's why Tarkos wipe system is great."
1507320,1510200," Yeah, I think it just needs to wipe like often."
1510200,1511200," Is that the one?"
1511200,1512840," A lot of people are saying arc."
1512840,1513840," I don't know much about it."
1513840,1517400," Yeah, I think people are upset about art because they have a new one coming and then"
1517400,1523280," they uploaded a remaster or they released a remaster of the original, even though the"
1523280,1529240," second one is coming, but then they wanted to charge for the remaster and they were"
1529240,1532000," going to disable access to the first one."
1532000,1540240," So essentially it was like a forced upgrade to like arc 1.1 when arc two was coming or"
1540240,1541240," something like that."
1541240,1542240," That's gross."
1542240,1544960," Yeah, so that's not quite related to what we were talking about actually now that I"
1544960,1551320," think about it a bit more, but it's a way that game developers are going to have to"
1551320,1554600," figure out or it's an example of how game developers are going to have to figure out"
1554600,1559480," how to manage this relationship as they rev their software knowing that their previous"
1559480,1567360," games as a service either isn't gone or either is gone and they have to figure out how to"
1567360,1571960," smooth that over or isn't gone and they have to incentivize people to move on to the next"
1571960,1572960," thing."
1572960,1576560," So ultimately it's not just a remaster, but you have to repay for all of the DLCs."
1576560,1577560," Nice."
1577560,1578560," That's ridiculous."
1578560,1582480," Speaking of moving on, why don't we talk about our next big, oh, hold on a second."
1582480,1584440," Do we want to jump to a non AI?"
1584440,1589400," Riley says Luke, look at this quote unquote, a really big deal."
1589400,1594440," Dolly is a free open source chat GPT style AI model."
1594440,1595440," Yeah."
1595440,1596440," Oh."
1596440,1603040," So we've we've talked about a few different open source chat GPT style model."
1603040,1607280," Oh, this is just what you're talking about where you bring the whole processing load."
1607280,1608280," Locally."
1608280,1609280," Yeah."
1609280,1611440," So there's a couple of these that are already out."
1611440,1617760," I think this is literally trained off of the predecessors like Lama and Alpaca."
1617760,1621480," I think it's just a like better, more advanced version of those."
1621480,1626160," I haven't looked super deeply into this, but I do believe it's essentially the same deal,"
1626160,1630360," but like just much stronger than Lama and Alpaca were."
1630360,1632200," All right."
1632200,1635200," Let's talk about really big deal."
1635200,1636200," Yeah."
1636200,1637640," Like I haven't looked."
1637640,1641840," I haven't like downloaded this and ran it myself yet, but as far as my understanding goes,"
1641840,1644800," it's just like a way more advanced version of those."
1644800,1646800," All right."
1646800,1648760," Let's do it."
1648760,1649760," Do what?"
1649760,1650760," The one."
1650760,1651760," The one."
1651760,1652760," Yep."
1652760,1653760," We have to talk about Twitter."
1653760,1654760," We're just going straight down the list."
1654760,1655760," Let's do it."
1655760,1661360," Well on Musk pivots to AI, you know, he was talking about the everything app in the past."
1661360,1665080," So if you're doing an everything app, then you have to chase the flavor of the month"
1665080,1666080," all the time."
1666080,1668920," And that means right now chasing AI."
1668920,1674720," Musk has recently hired talent from Google subsidiary DeepMind and purchased around 10,000"
1674720,1684240," GPUs in an apparent pivot towards development of a chat GPT rival at the or some other AI"
1684240,1688160," based thing, maybe say open AI, not chat GPT."
1688160,1692480," At the same time, Twitter Inc has been folded into X Corp."
1692480,1693680," That's an interesting one."
1693680,1698680," One of two corporate entities created in March alongside X dot AI."
1698680,1702000," It's unclear precisely what form this new AI project will take."
1702000,1707080," I genuinely don't know anyone that is confident in what the heck they would be doing."
1707080,1710960," But it is likely it likely has something to do with Elon Musk proposed everything app"
1710960,1713760," as we mentioned earlier, which he calls X."
1713760,1720360," According to Musk, he wants to make the X app analogous to we chat in terms of functionality."
1720360,1725880," Musk has announced that Twitter slash X Corp will now be auto replying to press inquiries"
1725880,1730040," with poop emojis, making it difficult to get straight, a straightforward comment on the"
1730040,1732200," future direction of the company."
1732200,1733280," Very cool."
1733280,1735600," Elon also announced Twitter subscriptions."
1735600,1741440," Creators can charge followers for exclusive long form tweets and hours long video or shorter"
1741440,1743320," up to hours long video."
1743320,1749920," The first year, the first year, the first year, the first year, the first year, the first year."
1749920,1758040," Can I pitch a theory here?"
1758040,1761960," I feel like a lot of the other coverage and conversation that I've seen around this has"
1761960,1766480," been what game of 4D chess is he playing?"
1766480,1773080," What will be the vision for the everything app or whatever else it is?"
1773080,1776120," I actually think it is way simpler than that."
1776120,1785920," Here's my cynical, the simplest answer is probably the correct answer theory."
1785920,1788680," I think he wants to unload Twitter."
1788680,1792440," So it makes sense to fold it into something else."
1792440,1797880," So now it's X Corp, which is cool or something."
1797880,1810440," I think that by tying X Corp to this everything app/it's working on AI kind of BS, Silicon"
1810440,1815520," Valley startup kind of nebulous, cool factor brand."
1815520,1819520," There's more than 2000 AI startups in the last week, if I remember correctly."
1819520,1821320," So it makes sense?"
1821320,1829080," So creating a perceived value by throwing his very loud noise making skills at a really"
1829080,1836160," big buzzword could give him an opportunity to dump Twitter before anyone realizes that"
1836160,1841400," they're not actually doing anything other than buying GPUs, which has also been in the"
1841400,1845960," headlines because NVIDIA has been talking about how cryptocurrency stupid, AI is our"
1845960,1846960," future."
1846960,1848960," Everyone needs to buy GPUs for AI."
1848960,1851200," So we're in video, let's go."
1851200,1853200," There are other processors for AI."
1853200,1856320," I mean, NVIDIA is very dominant in the space right now, but they are not going to be the"
1856320,1858480," only one forever."
1858480,1865680," So I actually think it's just the simplest and why would he avoid press inquiries?"
1865680,1871000," Well, because press ask uncomfortable questions, man, that interview."
1871000,1872280," I haven't watched it."
1872280,1873840," I've watched some clips from it."
1873840,1875400," I've been told I should watch it, but I haven't watched it."
1875400,1877320," It's pretty rough."
1877320,1882440," Because the press asks uncomfortable questions and doesn't just ask them, but expects a real"
1882440,1883440," well-fought out answer."
1883440,1886320," They're not just going to accept whatever stupid thing you say."
1886320,1894120," So by stonewalling any serious inquiry about what's going on, he gives himself the only"
1894120,1899440," speaker's gavel or speaker's staff or whatever thing the speaker holds in this particular"
1899440,1907240," weird timeline we're on, allowing himself to build this narrative of what Xcorp/Twitter/VHS"
1907240,1914080," dash XAI actually is under this shroud of secrecy where actually it's just doing weird"
1914080,1918080," little proofs of concept with engineers, it borrows from Tesla or whatever."
1918080,1923680," And then hopefully he can find someone stupid enough to put a bunch of investment money"
1923680,1929240," into this so that he can dump his share somehow and just get the crap away from this dumpster"
1929240,1930240," fire."
1930240,1935000," I think he's just, I think this is just a loss minimizing strategy."
1935000,1940400," I think it's maybe it's just because I'm a very cynical person at this point, but it"
1940400,1944840," seems pretty transparent to me."
1944840,1949960," What go in line with a move that I've seen from a couple little startups recently, which"
1949960,1958320," is why they find an engineer that they feel like they can label as a superstar like LLM"
1958320,1961160," AI machine learning engineer."
1961160,1964520," They pay them big megabucks to come on board."
1964520,1968600," They buy a ton of GPUs, they slap a label on their project and they just try to flip"
1968600,1971440," it like literally like that week."
1971440,1975200," There's some flips that have been happening very, very fast."
1975200,1980800," There's also big money in this type of engineering right now because, you know, Twitter buying"
1980800,1991000," 10,000 GPUs, these are expensive like a 100 big super chip, very big money like $45,000"
1991000,1993320," on eBay graphics cards right now."
1993320,1995320," $45,000 or $45,000."
1995320,1997320," $45,000."
1997320,1999120," Is that just scalping that's going on right now?"
1999120,2000800," Like is this a thing?"
2000800,2001800," Yeah."
2001800,2002800," How much is a hopper?"
2002800,2006520," Let me see if I can find it."
2006520,2008120," H100 GPU."
2008120,2009720," Let's go."
2009720,2013360," $42,000 for a Tesla H100."
2013360,2015160," H100, sorry, not A100."
2015160,2017880," Yeah, that's the last gen you're thinking of."
2017880,2021160," But yeah, I don't think these were worth that much before."
2021160,2029880," Yeah, probably not because the problem is a lot of these companies that, you know, some"
2029880,2035000," of them might just be trying to cash in on like the .com 2.0 hype kind of thing."
2035000,2040440," Some of them also have very good ideas and they need these GPUs to power those ideas and"
2040440,2042320," they can't get them."
2042320,2043320," They got investor money."
2043320,2044720," They're going to get them somehow."
2044720,2045720," Right."
2045720,2050640," Apparently the MSRP for this one or well, there is no MSRP for something like this."
2050640,2052680," I don't think this is a big buy."
2052680,2055840," But apparently the price for these is typically around $35,000."
2055840,2056840," Oh, okay."
2056840,2057840," Yeah."
2057840,2058840," I mean, it still worked up."
2058840,2059840," I mean, it still worked up."
2059840,2060840," I mean, it still worked up."
2060840,2061840," I mean, it still worked up."

2080840,2083840," I mean, it still worked up."
2083840,2086840," I mean, it still worked up."
2086840,2087840," I mean, it still worked up."
2087840,2088840," I mean, it still worked up."
2088840,2089840," I mean, it still worked up."
2089840,2090840," I mean, it still worked up."
2090840,2091840," I mean, it still worked up."
2091840,2092840," I mean, it still worked up."

2102840,2103840," I mean, it still worked up."
2103840,2104840," I mean, it still worked up."
2104840,2105840," I mean, it still worked up."
2105840,2106840," I mean, it still worked up."

2110840,2111840," I mean, it still worked up."
2111840,2112840," I mean, it still worked up."
2112840,2113840," I mean, it still worked up."
2113840,2114840," I mean, it still worked up."
2114840,2115840," I mean, it still worked up."
2115840,2116840," I mean, it still worked up."
2116840,2117840," I mean, it still worked up."
2117840,2118840," I mean, it still worked up."
2118840,2119840," I mean, it still worked up."
2119840,2120840," I mean, it still worked up."
2120840,2121840," I mean, it still worked up."
2121840,2122840," I mean, it still worked up."
2122840,2123840," I mean, it still worked up."
2123840,2124840," I mean, it still worked up."
2124840,2125840," I mean, it still worked up."
2125840,2126840," I mean, it still worked up."
2127840,2132440," Because when you're talking about it like the previous topic where we mentioned that"
2132440,2136840," it will like get distracted or confused with complex goals."
2136840,2142440," Well, okay, it might be more productive to work on keeping it on task by teaching it"
2142440,2147840," how to, you know, break apart problems and compartmentalize parts of it like you do with"
2147840,2151840," like, like humans do, to be completely honest."
2151840,2156240," If you get this massive complicated task, instead of trying to tackle the entire thing"
2156240,2161240," as one big unit, you often break it down into smaller things so that you can easily,"
2161240,2164240," more easily task tackle it and keep yourself focused."
2164240,2169640," Well, working on things like that might actually be more beneficial and get you to a higher"
2169640,2174240," perceived performance and power faster than just training a bigger model that's going"
2174240,2176240," to have the same problem."
2176240,2178240," So, yeah."
2178240,2181240," I also want to talk about LinkedIn verified."
2181240,2182240," Yeah."
2182240,2190520," Speaking of everything apps, LinkedIn has gone from somewhere that you go just for the exclusive"
2190520,2195600," purpose of updating your resume when you're looking for a job to as far as I can tell,"
2195600,2202240," the primary social network for."
2202240,2211520," I'm just trying to think probably most of the working adults that I know like and I"
2211520,2216840," don't mean I'm aware of like I'm not talking about people that I've added a couple times"
2216840,2222680," on Twitter or whatever else I'm talking about people that I know who mostly I only work."
2222680,2226000," So I mean most of the people I know are through work."
2226000,2232880," The amount of just sort of random crap posting on LinkedIn and just life updates people are"
2232880,2236000," posting on there, how active it is?"
2236000,2242080," Because I don't really engage with it so almost everyone that I'm connected with on LinkedIn"
2242080,2246920," is someone that I added over 10 years ago back when I was updating my resume because"
2246920,2248600," I was looking for a job, right?"
2248600,2250320," Like that's how I used it."
2250320,2255480," But the way that it's used has evolved so much now and this is cool."
2255480,2258080," They're rolling out a verification program."
2258080,2265280," So it looks like by confirming users' identities and their workplace, it's going to start to"
2265280,2267880," work kind of like blind."
2267880,2274720," So in addition to being a social network that you just generally engage with your professional"
2274720,2279320," circle through and then just apparently engage with just about anybody based on the messages"
2279320,2285640," I get on LinkedIn, it's going to become more like a private version of your own internal"
2285640,2291320," work chat slash board slash slack."
2291320,2295200," I mean it's owned by Microsoft so it might it could tie into teams even if you wanted."
2295200,2302920," But without the filter of being worried that your system administrator or your boss is"
2302920,2308840," going to archive and read any message that you post until LinkedIn has a data breach."
2308840,2310040," Until LinkedIn has a breach."
2310040,2312480," I mean you just said owned by Microsoft."
2312480,2315960," Once the last time Microsoft had a major user data breach."
2315960,2318360," But nobody's like, no it's terrible."
2318360,2321000," Hey, we're not saying it's impossible."
2321000,2322640," But that is fair."
2322640,2324720," Microsoft has been pretty solid for quite a while now."
2324720,2328360," So they're going to send a security code through your work email so they'll actually"
2328360,2330480," verify the domain of your workplace."
2330480,2332760," Make sure that you have a functioning email."
2332760,2333760," Makes sense."
2333760,2338560," And even have people submit their government ID to a third party verification service."
2338560,2343600," This is basically what Google tried to do with Google+."
2343600,2346320," I barely remember how Google+ functioned to be completely honest."
2346320,2348680," Google+ the concept was circles."
2348680,2349680," Yeah."
2349680,2351440," Okay for one thing and that okay."
2351440,2359440," We're not going back to circles but also creating pods of well here's my professional network."
2359440,2361240," Here's whatever else."
2361240,2364440," I think that you could easily use it this way if you really wanted to."
2364440,2369120," But the big one was when they integrated Google+ with YouTube was they wanted to cut"
2369120,2371080," down on spam."
2371080,2373440," Apparently Azur just had a breach."
2373440,2375880," Oh, awesome."
2375880,2376880," Are you kidding me?"
2376880,2377880," Okay great timing."
2377880,2380440," Okay, so your data won't be safe."
2380440,2390280," But hey, at least you can send snarky messages about Jeff from accounting to sue from logistics"
2390280,2391280," or whatever else."
2391280,2392960," Anyway, that doesn't change my point."
2392960,2400420," The point is that YouTube was attempting to moderate the conversations that were occurring"
2400420,2406760," on YouTube by having everyone verify their identity, use real identities."
2406760,2410840," And Facebook tried to do something very similar when they cracked down on people having just"
2410840,2415240," sort of nonsense profile names and had people, they restricted your ability to change your"
2415240,2416240," name all the time."
2416240,2418680," They had you actually submit."
2418680,2422480," It would call you on it if you submitted something that didn't sound like a real enough"
2422480,2424520," name."
2424520,2432080," It feels like we frogs have been kind of boy like remember Bob and his tank army when"
2432080,2437200," Google integrated YouTube and Google+ and wanted everybody to use real identities, the"
2437200,2440880," kind of rebellion that took place on the internet."
2440880,2447800," And now I'm even looking at this going this is kind of this is feels like a feature."
2447800,2452240," This is apparently part of an effort to crack down on fraud and impersonation on the site,"
2452240,2457980," which would be which would legitimately make it a much better experience, which isn't really"
2457980,2460440," different from what Google was trying to do."
2460440,2461440," Would we have this?"
2461440,2462440," I think it is."
2462440,2465800," I was having I was actually having this conversation with some friends literally last night."
2465800,2469240," Not this exact one, but about like your frogs comment."
2469240,2470240," Sure."
2470240,2473000," About how a lot of people have just kind of give it up on privacy when that used to be"
2473000,2475040," like a huge conversation."
2475040,2478840," And genuinely a massive percentage of the population is like, yeah, I'll just have like"
2478840,2481840," Amazon echoes all around my house and ring doorbells and whatever."
2481840,2483760," And I don't care."
2483760,2490080," I think this is a little bit different because LinkedIn has never been anonymous."
2490080,2491080," Yeah."
2491080,2494560," And Google or YouTube comments and all that kind of stuff."
2494560,2497280," They were anonymous and then that was taken away."
2497280,2501440," LinkedIn's like whole purpose was like, look, this is who I am."
2501440,2502480," This is my name."
2502480,2503520," This is where I work."
2503520,2506080," This is everything I've ever done, all that kind of stuff."
2506080,2509240," So I don't feel like it's really a change of tone for the platform."
2509240,2514560," So is it just a change in attitude for the user that they enjoy and appreciate the more"
2514560,2517080," meaningful interactions they have on this platform?"
2517080,2518240," I could definitely see that being a thing."
2518240,2523120," They are gravitating towards using it even if they're not really thinking about why it"
2523120,2524320," works so much better."
2524320,2529400," It could be that in this like era of the internet we're now kind of separating like the same"
2529400,2535040," person might still want their anonymity on Twitter or YouTube comments or whatever else,"
2535040,2539520," but then want to have more direct know the person you're talking to conversations on"
2539520,2542760," another platform somewhere else like potentially LinkedIn."
2542760,2544120," I could totally see that being a thing."
2544120,2547840," I would have to purge my LinkedIn because I just like."
2547840,2549480," I'm going to go to Luke's LinkedIn."
2549480,2552680," At some point in time, I just like added everyone."
2552680,2556720," Oh, were you job searching?"
2556720,2559560," Did it seem like we were going through a rough patch?"
2559560,2561440," Oh, I think this was when you were doing it too."
2561440,2563160," I think we were both in panic mode."
2563160,2564560," I think I've updated my picture."
2564560,2565560," Now hold on a second."
2565560,2569080," You actually know you haven't."
2569080,2571080," That's really old."
2571080,2572360," Is that from Taiwan?"
2572360,2573600," I actually don't know."
2573600,2574600," I think so."
2574600,2576640," I think we clearly took that, but I don't know where we were."
2576640,2578240," That's got to be in Taiwan."
2578240,2579240," You've updated it recently."
2579240,2582520," I updated it slightly because so many people were contacting me."
2582520,2584080," So we're linked in for work."
2584080,2585080," You're all over that."
2585080,2586240," You're all over that LinkedIn."
2586240,2587680," No, because they wanted jobs here."
2587680,2590920," Yeah, because you updated your updated your title."
2590920,2591920," Whoa, no, no, no."
2591920,2593960," What jobs you got following for last time?"
2593960,2594960," Oh."
2594960,2596880," No, that's ancient."
2596880,2598120," Oh, I see."
2598120,2599120," Yeah."
2599120,2600520," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
2600520,2602040," 500 plus connections."
2602040,2603400," Yeah, I ruined it."
2603400,2604400," I did gravy."
2604400,2606480," It's like a lot more than that too."
2606480,2607480," Huh."
2607480,2608480," That's just what they just blew."
2608480,2609480," Wow, cool certification, bro."
2609480,2610480," Hey, it's real."
2610480,2611480," I got it."
2611480,2612720," I mean, yeah, I guess so."
2612720,2613720," Yep."
2613720,2614720," Neat."
2614720,2616440," Oh, this was while you were working here."
2616440,2617440," Did I pay for that?"
2617440,2618440," No, you don't remember that?"
2618440,2619440," No, you didn't."
2619440,2620440," Oh, okay."
2620440,2621440," Wow, you should have had me pay for it."
2621440,2622440," That was well before we had that program."
2622440,2623440," Oh, that makes sense."
2623440,2624440," Yeah, okay."
2624440,2625440," No, wait."
2625440,2627280," Oh, yeah, we didn't have any money."
2627280,2628280," No."
2628280,2629280," Right."
2629280,2631480," This is when you kept talking about gamifying the forum."
2631480,2632480," Yeah."
2632480,2634040," But it's because you took this course."
2634040,2635040," Yeah."
2635040,2636040," Got it."
2636040,2637040," Okay."
2637040,2638040," Yeah."
2638040,2642480," So what's the point of listing your University of Victoria education when it's very clear"
2642480,2646800," from the date range that you did not complete?"
2646800,2651040," I didn't finish the other one either."
2651040,2653320," That doesn't really answer my question at all."
2653320,2654320," Did you include yours?"
2654320,2655320," I'm, I'm checking."
2655320,2660200," Because if I'm going to shame you, then I guess I better check my own shiz over here."
2660200,2661920," You got your secondary school."
2661920,2666560," Oh, yeah, that's pretty cringe."
2666560,2669880," I don't know if that's better."
2669880,2670880," Founder."
2670880,2672840," Uh, committed to delivering fun."
2672840,2675440," YouTube video, social media project coordinator."
2675440,2676440," Mm hmm."
2676440,2677440," What a title."
2677440,2678440," I made it up, right?"
2678440,2679440," Obviously."
2679440,2680640," Like I didn't have a title."
2680640,2685820," I don't think I ever got a formal promotion the entire time I worked at NCIX, but I definitely"
2685820,2686820," got paid a lot more."
2686820,2689080," So I gave myself my own title."
2689080,2690600," Everyone kind of picked their own title there."
2690600,2691600," So whatever."
2691600,2698400," Um, retail sales representative, student works painting, life guarding, day camp, council"
2698400,2699400," out."
2699400,2705460," Yeah, I got my, no, I didn't put university on there because, because I didn't get a degree"
2705460,2706800," and I didn't get a diploma."
2706800,2710880," So I only counted, I only counted as possible on there."
2710880,2711880," I have what?"
2711880,2712880," Hold on."
2712880,2713880," When did you update this?"
2713880,2714880," Hold on."
2714880,2715880," Hold on."
2715880,2716880," Hold on."
2716880,2717880," I have what?"
2717880,2718880," Sorry."
2718880,2719880," Go down further."
2719880,2720880," Thank you."
2720880,2721880," Thank you."
2721880,2722880," Thank you."
2722880,2723880," Keep going."
2723880,2724880," Keep going."
2724880,2725880," Keep going."
2725880,2726880," Keep going."
2726880,2727880," Publications."
2727880,2728880," Fast as possible."
2728880,2729880," Yeah."
2729880,2730880," Insectives and CX."
2730880,2731880," Yeah."
2731880,2737880," Well, we started fast as possible six days after LMG was officially started."
2737880,2740880," Because remember, the idea behind it was that it was going to be."
2740880,2741880," I don't remember it was that soon."
2741880,2742880," Yeah."
2742880,2743880," Yeah."
2743880,2746880," Fast as possible was so important because it was going to be the vehicle by which we were"
2746880,2749840," going to get way more views on our paid video production work for brands."
2749840,2751920," People subscribed and get momentum."
2751920,2757320," And then it was going to also be just like fully paid videos for, you know, Corsair,"
2757320,2758840," Samsung or whatever the case may be."
2758840,2764240," I would totally stupid plan based on how YouTube works now where it's a lot more important"
2764240,2767400," how good the quality of the video is and a lot less important how many subscribers you"
2767400,2768400," have."
2768400,2771960," But it seemed like kind of a good idea at the time."
2771960,2773800," Yeah."
2773800,2775440," We started it pretty much right away."
2775440,2780440," And it was also at a time when pretty much everyone on YouTube had a secondary channel"
2780440,2781840," of some sort."
2781840,2786080," You know, whether it was a vlog channel or behind the scenes channel or like."
2786080,2788200," Even a lot of them were just called like two cooking streams."
2788200,2789200," Yeah."
2789200,2790200," Yeah."
2790200,2791200," Just just two."
2791200,2796640," So I wanted some kind of second identity whether it was if the main channel went down"
2796640,2799200," or stopped growing or."
2799200,2802240," Something I discovered very recently is a super off topic, but that there's a bunch"
2802240,2805360," of channels that just mirror themselves."
2805360,2809440," They'll have another channel of a same similar or even completely different name that has"
2809440,2812280," all of the same content."
2812280,2816880," And some people that do that have gotten mad because YouTube has like gotten rid of"
2816880,2821240," their channel, their additional channel because of impersonation, but they're like, no wait,"
2821240,2823240," that's me."
2823240,2825320," I was like, I had no idea."
2825320,2827200," This was the thing that people did."
2827200,2828200," Interesting."
2828200,2831520," Apparently they do it not actually for like algorithmic gains."
2831520,2832680," They don't promote the other channel."
2832680,2833680," Okay."
2833680,2836240," So if the first channel just gets."
2836240,2837240," Deliified."
2837240,2838240," It's yote."
2838240,2839840," They have the second one still."
2839840,2844080," So if they get like content strikes on one of them, they can survive and just remove the"
2844080,2847840," chant and remove the videos that they got the content strikes from and then just keep"
2847840,2849340," going."
2849340,2852720," At least that's what the like one person I saw talking about it."
2852720,2853720," I'm sorry."
2853720,2854720," I don't believe that."
2854720,2855720," I might not be real."
2855720,2856720," I don't know."
2856720,2859800," I just saw one person commenting about that's how that's what they do."
2859800,2861120," That's interesting."
2861120,2865440," But yeah, okay, do we need to move on?"
2865440,2867760," Explain merge messages is our current thing."
2867760,2868760," Yeah."
2868760,2869760," Oh, okay."
2869760,2870760," Right."
2870760,2874280," So we're trying to make the show a little more structured."
2874280,2880800," We had a five hour when show last week, which was a a lot and be not even remotely feasible"
2880800,2883480," today given how late we ended up starting."
2883480,2887920," So Dan is trying to kind of cheap us in line here."
2887920,2892960," If you guys are not familiar yet, merge messages are the way to interact with the show, send"
2892960,2896720," little messages that pop up in the bottom to your friends or your mom, assuming your"
2896720,2897720," mom watches the WAN show."
2897720,2902120," So you can send a merge message to the other person whose mom I know watches the WAN show."
2902120,2904480," It also allows you to send just more."
2904480,2905480," I'm sure."
2905480,2908200," Topic suggestions just generally show some love."
2908200,2911920," It's a better way to interact with the show because unlike a Twitch bit or a super chat"
2911920,2916680," or whatever else the case may be a merge message might not get a response."
2916680,2922040," We do our best, but even if it doesn't, you will get your order in the mail and however"
2922040,2927120," long it takes to get to America or Timbuk to or Australia or wherever it happens to be"
2927120,2930520," that you live or if you're buying a gift for someone else."
2930520,2934120," So why don't we do a couple of merge messages to kind of, oh, right."
2934120,2938400," The way it works is you go on ltstore.com and in the checkout, you'll see a little box."
2938400,2941200," Whenever we're live, there's a box where you can fill in your merge message and it'll go"
2941200,2944280," into a queue to be sorted by producer Dan."
2944280,2948320," Do you want to hit us with a couple of merge messages and then we'll move on to our next"
2948320,2949320," topic?"
2949320,2950320," I do."
2950320,2951560," I've got a couple of good ones here for you."
2951560,2953440," First up is from Adrian."
2953440,2957680," If LMG didn't exist and you could choose to do whatever you wanted, where would you work"
2957680,2960960," and in what position?"
2960960,2963960," Well the position would definitely be on all fours."
2963960,2968360," Okay, hold on, hold on."
2968360,2969360," Okay."
2969360,2971560," I'm going to answer this two different ways."
2971560,2977320," I'm going to answer without the if you could choose to do whatever you wanted."
2977320,2983800," If LMG didn't exist, probably it would have collapsed around the first three to six months"
2983800,2985400," and I had a pretty solid job."
2985400,2986400," Or just never started."
2986400,2990960," Yeah, I had a pretty solid job offer at Western Digital."
2990960,2992400," I remember that."
2992400,3000880," And like it was like, it looked pretty good compared to the constant existential crisis"
3000880,3004080," that was Linus Media Group at that time."
3004080,3006680," I was thinking about it seriously enough."
3006680,3009960," I never, I always told them no, right?"
3009960,3012080," But I was thinking about it enough."
3012080,3015320," It was troubling me enough that I did talk to Luke and Ed about it."
3015320,3018640," It was like, hey, so this is like a thing."
3018640,3022840," It was fun because I lived with him at the time and I had abandoned both Ed and I had"
3022840,3027600," completely abandoned our educational prospects, which we were both doing very well with in"
3027600,3028920," order to start this company."
3028920,3033320," And then after we did that, he was talking to us and I was hearing him and a Vaughn update"
3033320,3037040," his LinkedIn profile so he could get a different job and abandon this project."
3037040,3038600," That was a very cool era."
3038600,3040360," When did I update my LinkedIn profile?"
3040360,3043160," I was already living with you and we were working on this."
3043160,3044160," Are you sure?"
3044160,3047800," You're updating your LinkedIn because of the WD thing."
3047800,3056560," I thought I remember writing all of this stuff on my LinkedIn profile in my office when"
3056560,3059480," I was still at NCIX because I gave them like six months."
3059480,3061120," Oh, you might have also done that."
3061120,3062120," Oh, okay."
3062120,3063120," Yeah, I think."
3063120,3064120," Yeah, I don't."
3064120,3065640," I'm not saying it was exclusively at that time."
3065640,3068480," Okay, I can tell you I didn't update much."
3068480,3073600," I know because I updated my LinkedIn before I left because I wanted to be able to check"
3073600,3076960," a whole bunch of numbers while I still had access to the internal system."
3076960,3079720," How much did I grow the revenue on this line from when to when?"
3079720,3080720," So I did."
3080720,3082360," I did the vast majority of that then."
3082360,3088120," It was communicated as a like if this does burn."
3088120,3091080," This is my plan, but the plan is for it to not burn."
3091080,3092280," I did talk to you."
3092280,3093680," And I was I mean, I was open about it."
3093680,3094680," I would rather know."
3094680,3097200," So like I'm not I'm not I'm not mad about it."
3097200,3098760," It was just a spicy moment."
3098760,3099760," That's all."
3099760,3100760," Yeah."
3100760,3102720," Hey, hey, we made it."
3102720,3103720," We made it."
3103720,3104720," Yeah."
3104720,3105720," Who?"
3105720,3109920," And like it wasn't like it wasn't like I wasn't considering what I would do."
3109920,3110920," Yeah."
3110920,3111920," Like I don't know."
3111920,3113520," I don't know if Ed was."
3113520,3114520," I'm not sure."
3114520,3118200," I think he just had no plan."
3118200,3119800," I don't know."
3119800,3120800," Cool."
3120800,3121800," I don't figure it out."
3121800,3122800," It sucks."
3122800,3123800," Maybe it's pointless."
3123800,3125640," I don't want to just not do that."
3125640,3127000," You probably would have been fine with that."
3127000,3129300," So I had tried to apply to Amazon."
3129300,3131040," So that was clearly something that I wanted to do."
3131040,3132440," I didn't get the job at Amazon."
3132440,3139160," So I went full bore into getting Linus Media Group started and then shortly until Linus"
3139160,3141480," Media Group, I got the offer from WD."
3141480,3146900," That was probably the best offer that I got and might have catapulted me into some kind"
3146900,3152040," of marketing position somewhere else would I have ended up."
3152040,3155920," I would have if I had gotten had gotten desperate enough."
3155920,3159600," Paul and Kyle, I think, had already split from Newegg at this point."
3159600,3161640," I'm not 100% sure."
3161640,3165080," But just like running and joining the video team there, I don't think they had."
3165080,3166840," I think they were still there."
3166840,3171240," But if I had applied, I'm sure I could have become a host there."
3171240,3174200," That was an option that I was turning over in my mind."
3174200,3175360," There was some plan."
3175360,3176360," Oh, man."
3176360,3178920," I don't know if I'm hallucinating this or not."
3178920,3180680," I think there was some plan."
3180680,3181680," Our plan."
3181680,3182680," Chat GPT."
3182680,3187120," I think there was some plan at some point that we had talked about where if it didn't"
3187120,3189640," work, you and I were both going to go somewhere."
3189640,3190640," I don't remember where."
3190640,3195560," Well, no, I told you that one of the conditions that I had given to WD in the very short conversations"
3195560,3199520," was that I wanted to be able to bring my team with me because they wanted me to do some"
3199520,3202200," video stuff there and some capacity."
3202200,3203200," So that--"
3203200,3204200," Maybe that was it."
3204200,3207200," I don't-- it's been a long-- it's actually genuinely been a very long time."
3207200,3208200," It's been 10 years."
3208200,3209200," Yeah."
3209200,3212200," It's hard to remember the exact details of the conversations."
3212200,3213200," Yeah."
3213200,3215760," So if I recall correctly, they weren't that--"
3215760,3216760," Enthused on that?"
3216760,3218800," Yeah, they weren't that into that."
3218800,3222800," Well, I don't think because you guys weren't good, I think, just because they didn't really"
3222800,3223800," know you guys."
3223800,3226120," And that's a sudden change to the ask."
3226120,3227120," Yeah."
3227120,3228840," If you hire me, you have to hire three people."
3228840,3229840," That's like--"
3229840,3231320," Well, by that time, Brandon was with us too."
3231320,3232320," Four."
3232320,3233320," So four."
3233320,3234320," Yeah."
3234320,3235320," Yeah, that's a lot."
3235320,3238120," Now I'm going to answer as though I could do anything I want."
3238120,3239120," I don't know."
3239120,3242600," Being like a professional footballer looks pretty good."
3242600,3243600," [LAUGHTER]"
3243600,3244600," I mean soccer."
3244600,3245600," Do you mean soccer?"
3245600,3246600," Yeah."
3246600,3247600," Yeah, yeah."
3247600,3248600," I mean soccer."
3248600,3249600," Like, yeah, yeah."
3249600,3251080," Like if I could just be like Cristiano Ronaldo--"
3251080,3253400," Not bad, but they don't make any money."
3253400,3257040," Yeah, like, you know, it seems like that seems pretty good."
3257040,3267040," Or like, oh man, can I just be the son of like someone who has a job?"
3267040,3269040," It appears to be a thing."
3269040,3270040," Yeah."
3270040,3272040," Ah, no, that's--"
3272040,3274200," That doesn't really count, but that is a thing."
3274200,3277280," No, that's a lie because I think you and I both know that I would--"
3277280,3278280," You want to do something."
3278280,3283320," I was having this conversation with Jake actually like two days ago."
3283320,3291520," Because he sent me a picture of his trunk full of new speakers when we just upgraded"
3291520,3294360," his speakers as part of his extreme tech upgrade."
3294360,3295360," OK?"
3295360,3301200," And then a week or two weeks later, he's sending me pictures of his Home Depot run where he"
3301200,3306240," got this super cool new acoustic material and some rock wall."
3306240,3309440," And then the week after that, he's sending me pictures of--"
3309440,3312040," He's been on a mega sound kick for a while."
3312040,3318440," I'm building panels and putting fabric over them and whatever."
3318440,3326680," And I'm like, brother, you know why you drive me crazy?"
3326680,3330200," Because you are just f***ing like me."
3330200,3331960," That is the worst thing about you."
3331960,3333880," You are just like me."
3333880,3340160," How long have you actually spent listening to music?"
3340160,3341240," And I have his response."
3341240,3342240," This is fantastic."
3342240,3347240," Where is it?"
3347240,3354960," Like the number of hours he has spent optimizing his setup."
3354960,3355960," Dels, del switches."
3355960,3359320," Oh man, I text Jake a lot."
3359320,3363360," Oh, the problem is that I'm on teams."
3363360,3365640," OK, hold on."
3365640,3369120," Oh, this is taking far too long."
3369120,3370120," I'm so sorry."
3370120,3374200," I thought this was going to be the kind of thing that I just had ready at a moment's"
3374200,3375200," noticed."
3375200,3376200," Anyway, whatever."
3376200,3381840," The point is, it was like four minutes."
3381840,3384680," Because he spent all his time setting it up--"
3384680,3385680," Building the thing."
3385680,3386680," Yeah."
3386680,3387680," Many hours."
3387680,3389360," And it was like, dang, this sounds awesome."
3389360,3394040," So it's like how you would spend weeks building the perfect thing with a computer and then"
3394040,3395280," don't play any games?"
3395280,3396280," Yeah."
3396280,3397280," Yeah."
3397280,3402760," So I spend hours setting up a headphone listening room with all different amps and"
3402760,3408480," dacks and headphones, which we did here, and then not use it once."
3408480,3415640," Or how I would set up a gaming lounge so that I can hang out on lounge nights only to show"
3415640,3419320," up a grand total of probably three times, I think, I've managed to make it to lounge"
3419320,3420320," night."
3420320,3426960," And I even have made it like part of Chase's duties, our event coordinator, part of his"
3426960,3429320," duties to ensure that those happen every two weeks."
3429320,3430320," So they're happening."
3430320,3432080," I'm paying for it."
3432080,3434880," And I almost never actually get to go."
3434880,3441040," Or, OK, since we're at it, how I would set up a home theater room so that, I mean, I guess"
3441040,3446520," my kids use it, but I think I've actually only watched about four movies since we moved"
3446520,3449800," in in the theater room."
3449800,3452400," Because I just-- I can't help it."
3452400,3461920," I would rather build the Lego kit than actually play with my Lego dragon when I'm done."
3461920,3463880," It's just the way that I am."
3463880,3473360," So if I had to get into an industry, maybe I would get into commercial real estate development,"
3473360,3475080," something like that."
3475080,3479320," If the clients weren't horrible, I think it could actually be pretty enjoyable because"
3479320,3484400," you're just constantly learning about what this person's work-- what this company's--"
3484400,3485880," this organization's workflow is."
3485880,3488680," I feel like you and Vom both like that."
3488680,3491800," And finding solutions and optimizing."
3491800,3496880," I think another thing that would be pretty fun for me is anything to do with anything"
3496880,3502080," like really hands on-- no."
3502080,3504840," No, that's what I'm going with."
3504840,3506680," OK, your answer."
3506680,3511640," I had a ton of different paths that I was pursuing, like actually an insane amount of"
3511640,3518680," different things that I was actually working on."
3518680,3524040," The most direct path that I was on, the thing that I had an offer for and whatnot, was software"
3524040,3526320," development and database management based."
3526320,3528120," Would I have wanted to do that forever?"
3528120,3529120," Probably not."
3529120,3530120," But it seemed like the most direct path out of school."
3530120,3533440," And you would have just automated the vast majority of it and like, I don't know, played"
3533440,3534440," video games."
3534440,3535440," But I think you would have gotten bored."
3535440,3536440," I would have gotten bored."
3536440,3537440," Exactly."
3537440,3538440," Yeah, 100%."
3538440,3539440," Yeah."
3539440,3540440," Yeah."
3540440,3541440," So--"
3541440,3545840," Unless you did it at a really small company where everything was constantly on fire."
3545840,3549640," So what I think I actually probably would have ended up doing, this is still not like"
3549640,3551760," get to pick anything in the world is your career?"
3551760,3552760," Yeah."
3552760,3554400," But like disaster recovery."
3554400,3555400," OK, sure."
3555400,3557520," I should even think I would really enjoy that."
3557520,3560920," Probably like nation scale."
3560920,3562520," So like natural disaster recovery."
3562520,3563520," Oh, OK."
3563520,3564520," Interesting."
3564520,3568400," Figuring out how comes and logistics are going to work and whatever."
3568400,3569400," OK."
3569400,3571480," And then like coordinating responses and doing all that kind of stuff."
3571480,3574440," I genuinely think I would really like that."
3574440,3579840," If I could pick anything, astronaut, and I actually do mean that seriously, I just don't"
3579840,3582760," think I would actually be able to like make the cut right now."
3582760,3583760," Oh, yeah."
3583760,3584760," Yeah."
3584760,3585760," No, you got to be--"
3585760,3588680," Because you have to be like a genius and like an athlete and whatever."
3588680,3593520," And like I have bad eyes and dyslexia and like other things where like--"
3593520,3594520," Yeah."
3594520,3595520," And you're like almost too old."
3595520,3596720," At this point, yeah, probably."
3596720,3597720," Like, yeah."
3597720,3598720," Get wrecked."
3598720,3601960," I mean, I thought about it when I was younger and then I thought about the cuts that you"
3601960,3605800," have to go along and all those type of stuff and where you end up if you don't make the"
3605800,3607360," cuts."
3607360,3611280," And I was like, yeah, probably not."
3611280,3613480," I think I'm not going to go in that direction."
3613480,3614480," Right."
3614480,3618520," So it's one of those career paths like star quarterback."
3618520,3619520," Yeah."
3619520,3621120," Where if you make it cool."
3621120,3622120," Great."
3622120,3623120," And if you don't--"
3623120,3629480," Like, and it's not 100% that way because you usually end up with very extreme education"
3629480,3630680," experience and stuff."
3630680,3634840," And the jobs that you can get if you don't make it are very good."
3634840,3635840," Sure."
3635840,3636840," Often."
3636840,3637840," Respectable."
3637840,3638840," Yes."
3638840,3639840," But not what I would necessarily want to do."
3639840,3640840," I get it."
3640840,3643920," So it's not quite the-- it's sort of as in like it ends you up somewhere that you don't"
3643920,3649080," want to be but not as much because a lot of the potential jobs are like very serious big"
3649080,3653840," time career type things but they're still not necessarily things that I would want"
3653840,3654840," to do."
3654840,3655840," Okay."
3655840,3656840," That's again, Dan."
3656840,3657840," Yeah."
3657840,3660280," Oh, I think it's about time to move on to some more topics unless you really do want"
3660280,3661280," another one."
3661280,3662280," Yeah, you have to give us one more."
3662280,3663280," Sorry."
3663280,3664280," That's all right."
3664280,3665280," All right."
3665280,3666280," I don't make the rules."
3666280,3667280," We're working through it together."
3667280,3668280," Okay."
3668280,3669280," Next up is from Gary."
3669280,3670280," Discuss."
3670280,3672240," This is more of a demand than a question."
3672240,3677920," A pair of 17 year old students used a flipper zero finding flaws in their schools RFID and"
3677920,3678920," network."
3678920,3681240," Students are now facing legal trouble."
3681240,3691200," That's what do you tell parents students?"
3691200,3699560," So this is a tough one because while they might have been right to--"
3699560,3700880," We're missing some information."
3700880,3701880," Find vulnerabilities."
3701880,3702880," Yeah."
3702880,3704920," We don't have the whole story here so I'm going to have to kind of come at it a few"
3704920,3706080," different ways."
3706080,3715200," While they might have been right to find and disclose vulnerabilities, to actually enact"
3715200,3722480," them to exploit them in any way could very well be illegal."
3722480,3730680," It's kind of like how it would be fine to knock on someone's door and tell them, \"Hey,"
3730680,3735680," that lock on your door is super insecure and you should replace it."
3735680,3736800," Have a great one."
3736800,3738240," See you later.\""
3738240,3739240," That's fine."
3739240,3740240," But if you sit there attempting to pick it."
3740240,3744920," But if you sit there and pick it and walk into their house and you're like, \"Hey, well"
3744920,3746000," meaning neighbor."
3746000,3747440," Yeah, everything's chill."
3747440,3750520," So I'll be on my way in a sec but your door is super insecure."
3750520,3753120," I was able to pick that in like 10 seconds."
3753120,3754600," See you later.\""
3754600,3756840," That's still breaking and entering."
3756840,3758360," Yeah."
3758360,3759960," So--"
3759960,3761960," So there's some stuff about this that we don't know."
3761960,3766760," If they detected vulnerabilities using Flipper Zero, didn't do anything with them and then"
3766760,3772080," reported it to the school and the school is trying to go after them with legal trouble,"
3772080,3777400," I hope that the internet rains down on that school with everything they've got."
3777400,3783160," If they did abuse things, I still think they should have a light hand with them."
3783160,3784160," They're students."
3784160,3787480," We don't know how old these students are."
3787480,3788480," That's fair."
3788480,3790200," There are students who are like 18 and--"
3790200,3793080," A pair of 17-year-old students, especially, do know how old they're."
3793080,3794440," Yeah, they're old enough."
3794440,3796320," I mean, come on."
3796320,3797960," It depends what they do, in my opinion."
3797960,3798960," Yeah, sure."
3798960,3801240," If they mess around and change the text on the school sign."
3801240,3803000," Yeah, that's pretty minor."
3803000,3804000," Yeah."
3804000,3805000," That's just pranks."
3805000,3806800," Give them a slap on the wrist, whatever."
3806800,3811800," If they tried to change their grades or something, I'm not saying this is even possible with"
3811800,3812800," that system."
3812800,3816840," I'm just saying, like that level of thing, then that could be a problem."
3816840,3818200," No, don't say that."
3818200,3819200," Don't say what."
3819200,3820200," OK."
3820200,3821200," I don't know."
3821200,3822200," Whatever."
3822200,3823200," Moving on."
3823200,3824200," All right."
3824200,3827880," Let's move on to our next topic here."
3827880,3830520," Do you want to talk about the Mario movie?"
3830520,3831520," Yeah, sure."
3831520,3833520," Now, you haven't seen it, right?"
3833520,3834520," No."
3834520,3835520," Have you read reviews?"
3835520,3836520," Uh--"
3836520,3837520," Or looked at watched reviews?"
3837520,3838520," I don't know."
3838520,3841040," How do we people review these days?"
3841040,3842040," Sort of?"
3842040,3843040," OK."
3843040,3844360," It's doing better than I thought it was going to do."
3844360,3845840," What are your expectations?"
3845840,3847400," Are you going to watch it?"
3847400,3849360," Because you'd never go to the movies."
3849360,3850360," I very rarely go to the movies."
3850360,3852400," Once the last time you went to a movie."
3852400,3854280," I literally don't know."
3854280,3860880," Was it when we went to see the second Kingsman?"
3860880,3862120," I think so, yeah."
3862120,3865840," Because I was like, the third one is out."
3865840,3866840," You know?"
3866840,3867960," Did we go see that one?"
3867960,3870400," No, we watched that one at my place."
3870400,3871400," Oh, yeah."
3871400,3872400," Very disappointing."
3872400,3875400," Because I remember it was pretty bad."
3875400,3876400," Yeah."
3876400,3877920," I need to go."
3877920,3880800," I am planning on going to the movies soon."
3880800,3882720," I want to go see John Wick 4 with Brandon."
3882720,3883720," OK."
3883720,3887920," I like going to see cinematic movies with Brandon because then he gets the geek out about them"
3887920,3888920," afterwards."
3888920,3891120," That's fun."
3891120,3892120," But I don't know."
3892120,3896240," I probably wait for it to come to some service."
3896240,3900480," But I can definitely watch because I definitely subscribe to it."
3900480,3903920," It's surprisingly fine."
3903920,3905440," OK."
3905440,3909320," My expectations based on the critical reception were pretty low."
3909320,3910320," Oh, yeah."
3910320,3912000," I assumed it was garbage."
3912000,3914960," And then apparently people seemed to like it a decent amount."
3914960,3919280," Yeah, right now on Rotten Tomatoes, let me jump to my screen."
3919280,3920280," Not that one."
3920280,3921280," Oh, boy."
3921280,3922760," He's good at this."
3922760,3926080," The tomato meter, so the reviewers give it a 58."
3926080,3927840," But audience 96."
3927840,3929240," Yeah."
3929240,3930480," People like it."
3930480,3935000," Those are both completely wrong."
3935000,3939240," It is not a 96% piece of storytelling."
3939240,3941120," Well, OK, no."
3941120,3942600," It's a visual fiesta."
3942600,3945400," That's not how Rotten Tomatoes works."
3945400,3947040," Because Rotten Tomatoes is yes or no."
3947040,3949440," And if you vote yes, it's like it goes up."
3949440,3950440," OK."
3950440,3957800," But in general, what would typically be a 96% would have to have everything?"
3957800,3958800," Yeah, yeah."
3958800,3963800," It would have to be great fun for the whole family, you know, all the multiple layers of"
3963800,3969320," whatever, you know, something like an up is a masterful animated film."
3969320,3970320," Definitely."
3970320,3972280," It's not up."
3972280,3973280," Right."
3973280,3975200," It's what is up ratings?"
3975200,3977560," Oh, it's probably close to 100%."
3977560,3980400," I mean, I kind of hope so."
3980400,3981400," 98."
3981400,3982400," Yeah."
3982400,3983400," It's not 2%."
3983400,3984400," Yeah."
3984400,3985720," It's not 2% worse than up."
3985720,3986720," It's not."
3986720,3988800," It's not the audience score for up is 90."
3988800,3989800," Yeah."
3989800,3990800," The tomato meter is 98."
3990800,3992800," Up is a bad taste."
3992800,3993800," Yeah."
3993800,4000080," So anyway, the Super Mario Brothers movie, though, what it is, is good, clean, fun."
4000080,4001080," It's Nintendo."
4001080,4004520," I mean, that's probably good."
4004520,4005840," It's good, clean, fun."
4005840,4011400," It's, you know, everything that I was worried would be kind of garbage about it."
4011400,4015800," Like if they if they overdid the references and they they did it."
4015800,4017040," It's of course there's a lot of reference."
4017040,4019720," It's from one reference to one reference to another reference."
4019720,4023240," You know, Nintendo has, what are we, what are we coming up on?"
4023240,4027240," Like, you know, 40 years of like modern era video gaming content."
4027240,4029480," Yeah, not their old playing cards."
4029480,4035640," Whether it's whether it's music or characters or environments or game or mechanics or whatever"
4035640,4039400," else it is or plumbers."
4039400,4045120," Nintendo Nintendo has so much to draw on that they can do that without it feeling stale."
4045120,4048480," And I actually, I enjoyed it."
4048480,4050960," It's not the kind of thing that I would watch again."
4050960,4054080," I don't, I don't need to, I don't need that."
4054080,4058520," I definitely, you know, I prefer Despicable Me if I'm going to, you know, pick an illumination"
4058520,4060040," film that I, that I like better."
4060040,4061040," Okay."
4061040,4063040," But it was fine."
4063040,4064040," Good enough."
4064040,4065040," Yeah, it was totally good enough."
4065040,4066040," The kids loved it."
4066040,4069360," Do you feel like the voice acting detracted from it?"
4069360,4071560," You know what, controversial take."
4071560,4072560," Here we go."
4072560,4073560," I thought Chris Pratt was fine."
4073560,4077080," I thought Enya Taylor Joy was terrible."
4077080,4081040," She took me out of the movie basically every time Princess Peach opened her mouth."
4081040,4083040," And it didn't take you out for Chris Pratt."
4083040,4084440," No, that's fine."
4084440,4085440," Interesting."
4085440,4086440," Yeah."
4086440,4093560," The thing that's crazy to me is that the voice actor for Mario is like alive and around"
4093560,4094560," his stuff."
4094560,4095560," Oh, what the heck?"
4095560,4096560," Yeah."
4096560,4097560," Yeah, it's fine."
4097560,4100440," It's like, actually, like I said, everything that I thought was terrible and I'm not really"
4100440,4101440," splitting anything."
4101440,4104240," He's, he's revealed in like the first couple minutes."
4104240,4108600," Everything that I thought was going to be bad was fine."
4108600,4112080," I want to ask like how they explain that away and stuff, but it's going to be too spoiler."
4112080,4113840," No, no, it's, it's just, it's fine."
4113840,4114840," Okay."
4114840,4115840," And it's fine."
4115840,4116840," Yeah."
4116840,4119680," The second one is going to be dog."
4119680,4122040," I'm calling it."
4122040,4124560," You feel like they spent all their like, yeah."
4124560,4125560," Yeah."
4125560,4126560," Yeah."
4126560,4127560," Yep."
4127560,4128560," All the good references are spent."
4128560,4132000," Well, any character development that they can do for Mario is."
4132000,4134000," Okay."
4134000,4135600," There's, there's plenty more to explore."
4135600,4142000," They have set up a cinematic universe worth of things to explore."
4142000,4150880," Which means someone is on a time, is on a time crunch creating the next cookie cutter"
4150880,4156720," installment of this that is meant to come out on ex-schedule, come hell or high water."
4156720,4162040," And don't forget about the, the TV show tie ins and all the video game tie ins that you're"
4162040,4165360," going to have to, you think you're going to have to play in order to know what's happening"
4165360,4170240," when Peach gets captured by Bowser and goes there and she gets rescued and there's a,"
4170240,4175120," going to be a little wink to the audience and Super Mario Brothers movie for and Toads"
4175120,4182160," standalone adventure movie when he has Toads adventure to or whatever, it's going to be"
4182160,4185520," awful."
4185520,4187680," I'm calling it now."
4187680,4193320," It's going to get super self referential to itself rather than to the rich video game"
4193320,4200320," history or I could be totally wrong and Nintendo could go an utterly different direction with"
4200320,4201320," it."
4201320,4202320," Spoilers."
4202320,4203520," No, there's, there's no spoilers."
4203520,4206800," I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking about it."
4206800,4208480," Spoilers for the movie that isn't out yet."
4208480,4209480," Yeah."
4209480,4210480," Yeah."
4210480,4211480," Exactly guys."
4211480,4218200," Ash Bros. multiverse is 100% going to be a thing and it's going to be atrocious."
4218200,4221160," Because the other thing too is they went with all their most recognizable characters right"
4221160,4222160," out of the gate."
4222160,4228160," So what it's going to be like Icarus and Game and Watch like I'm right."
4228160,4230520," Do you think they could do the adventures of someone else?"
4230520,4232240," I mean, they could, they could."
4232240,4235280," Just wouldn't perform as well."
4235280,4242920," I think if they wanted it to be good, they would probably go separate universes."
4242920,4246320," Do you think they could do stuff like, like someone in Flowplane chat mentioned Luigi"
4246320,4248120," go and Ghostbusters?"
4248120,4253080," Do you think they could do like a, like a murder mystery style thing with like the Luigi haunted"
4253080,4255200," house stuff?"
4255200,4259600," There's so much room for them to do something creative and amazing."
4259600,4262080," You know, I'd, I'd love to see a Zelda movie."
4262080,4263080," Oh."
4263080,4266720," I'd love to see it done really well."
4266720,4268440," It has to be done really well."
4268440,4269440," Totally different."
4269440,4271400," I'm still burnt off the Warcraft movie."
4271400,4273480," Like, I still like have a huge lack of trust."
4273480,4279640," Like, I almost want like, like cast away kind of vibes where, where it really focuses"
4279640,4288120," on, on Link and his lonely wandering or something or something, do something totally different."
4288120,4294200," The problem is that this is now the most successful animated film of all time in terms of like"
4294200,4295640," its first week take."
4295640,4296640," Yeah."
4296640,4300360," And you know how bean counters work, whether they're Nintendo bean counters."
4300360,4301160," It was number two."
4301160,4303160," Or Disney bean counters."
4303160,4305840," That, that, more of that."
4305840,4306840," Yeah."
4306840,4307840," Um, yeah."
4307840,4308840," Yeah."
4308840,4309840," It's disappointing."
4309840,4310840," Yeah."
4310840,4312680," I like Breath of the Wild."
4312680,4316920," Like Legend of Zelda spin off movie could actually be super sick."
4316920,4323320," Like a, like a hardcore survival film, but it's like Link trying to."
4323320,4325320," Ooh, live action would be cool."
4325320,4327320," Yeah, it could be good."
4327320,4331800," You want it to be animated."
4331800,4332800," My thing is, my thing is."
4332800,4334040," I don't think it should be cute."
4334040,4335920," They took the Warcraft movie."
4335920,4336920," Yeah."
4336920,4338800," Which has like, like people would watch."
4338800,4340280," This was actually a thing."
4340280,4344440," People uploaded just all of the cinematics for Warcraft 3, which don't even go into each"
4344440,4348840," other properly and just uploaded all of them in one video file onto YouTube."
4348840,4350120," Still, it had a movie than Twilight."
4350120,4353040," And people would just watch the whole thing all the way through."
4353040,4355160," It had tons of views back in the day."
4355160,4356160," Yeah."
4356160,4360960," Because the cinematics that Blizzard made for so long, even now, when they make full"
4360960,4364440," fledged ones, because they, not the in game ones, but when they make full fledged ones"
4364440,4368800," are like just absolutely legendary cinematics."
4368800,4371600," And then they're like Warcraft movie live action."
4371600,4373640," Like, what are you doing?"
4373640,4375520," And so I, oh man."
4375520,4378480," So I question that a little bit."
4378480,4384680," I actually think it would be like more legit."
4384680,4385680," I hazard saying this."
4385680,4390440," I think it would be more legit to do that with Legend of Zelda than it is with Warcraft"
4390440,4393160," or really any Blizzard title, to be completely honest."
4393160,4395600," But I still just, I hazard that."
4395600,4398800," There's all these like Disney, like, oh, we're going to live action, Lion King."
4398800,4399800," That's stupid."
4399800,4400800," Don't do that."
4400800,4401880," Well, yeah, it's not even live action."
4401880,4403360," That's just an animated movie."
4403360,4406800," Don't just like in a realistic style."
4406800,4409040," Well, let's take all the emotion out of it."
4409040,4410040," Cool."
4410040,4411720," So I, I'm speaking out of ignorance."
4411720,4413680," I haven't watched it because I don't care."
4413680,4414680," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
4414680,4417080," I just read the comments."
4417080,4421560," I'm just, I'm just like concerned."
4421560,4422560," That's all."
4422560,4424320," Shilab of this link."
4424320,4425320," Okay."
4425320,4427920," You guys are memeing now."
4427920,4428920," That's not funny."
4428920,4430720," Pretty funny."
4430720,4432120," Super immersive about it."
4432120,4438120," These like, Shilab gets arrested for like smashing pots at like home debars."
4438120,4439120," Oh my goodness."
4439120,4440120," I mean, it's not Ezra Miller."
4440120,4442120," So like, I don't know who that is."
4442120,4453560," Oh, that's the, that's the actor that is just, plays the flash and as far as we can tell,"
4453560,4455080," just a complete weirdo."
4455080,4456080," Oh, okay."
4456080,4457080," Yeah."
4457080,4458080," Yeah."
4458080,4461880," Man, speaking of method actors though, I, I would love, oh man, this is embarrassing"
4461880,4463360," Vigo Mortensen."
4463360,4466560," I'd love him as like Ganondorf or something."
4466560,4468920," Just like play a villain for a change."
4468920,4469920," That'd be cool."
4469920,4470920," That's Aragorn."
4470920,4471920," I know."
4471920,4472920," I knew that one."
4472920,4473920," He doesn't know actors."
4473920,4475120," Yeah, but I knew that one because I'm like a Lord of the Rings nerd."
4475120,4476120," Yeah."
4476120,4477120," Yeah."
4477120,4478120," All right."
4478120,4482560," Why don't we jump into Microsoft could be working on a Windows handheld mode for Steam"
4482560,4483800," Deck of likes."
4483800,4487840," This is super exciting."
4487840,4492520," Not because I want the Steam Deck to fail or because I want Steam OS to see any less development,"
4492520,4499840," not because I think that Windows is an alternative to Steam OS or that I, that I want it to become"
4499840,4500840," this easier path."
4500840,4506840," Now, blah, blah, blah, none of those things, but because competition is good, valves competition"
4506840,4512440," in the space, lit a fire under Microsoft, and we shouldn't let valve run unopposed either."
4512440,4518920," I mean, look how little innovation there was in steam until EA and Ubisoft basically said,"
4518920,4521840," look, we're going to take our ball and we're going to go home."
4521840,4523840," Well, valve innovated."
4523840,4524840," Would they have done it anyway?"
4524840,4528440," I don't know, maybe, maybe not though."
4528440,4529640," So this is exciting."
4529640,4534400," Prolific Microsoft Leaker walking cat shared two videos on Twitter that were taken from"
4534400,4541040," a pitch for an internal Microsoft hackathon project showcasing a Windows handheld mode."
4541040,4544720," The pitch acknowledges that the handheld PC market is growing thanks to a device called"
4544720,4545720," the Steam Deck."
4545720,4549920," This is a direct quote and shows prototype features that would make Windows easier to"
4549920,4554280," use on such devices such as optimizing the onboarding experience, which right now is"
4554280,4559160," very cludgy, cross platform, a cross platform game launcher built right into Windows."
4559160,4562720," Are we going back to the games folder from Vista?"
4562720,4565040," Because I'm actually down."
4565040,4566040," I liked it."
4566040,4567040," It was kind of awesome."
4567040,4568040," It was good."
4568040,4571360," I'm actually recently on a Wancho about how it's kind of annoying right now about how"
4571360,4574040," everything is trying to be your games launcher."
4574040,4576800," And like I would actually just prefer one of them."
4576800,4580840," And if Microsoft had stuck with it, like one of the things that it did was it pushed game"
4580840,4583600," developers to move their save games to one place."
4583600,4588360," So instead of having it sometimes being an at that are roaming and sometimes being in"
4588360,4594720," program files in the game folder and sometimes being in my games and sometimes just being"
4594720,4595720," in my documents."
4595720,4600800," Like men, game developers have never been able to decide where your saves go."
4600800,4605600," So Microsoft, one of the good things they did with Vista and with the games folder was"
4605600,4608040," they consolidated it all went in one place."
4608040,4612600," So when I had to reformat or whatever else, because cloud saves weren't as much of a thing,"
4612600,4616880," it was one folder that I dragged and it was good to and it was good to go."
4616880,4617880," Right?"
4617880,4623000," Now you got to deal with like, is it in app data or is it saved somewhere else or what"
4623000,4624000," that is going on?"
4624000,4627480," It's saved on that cloud saves are both a blessing and a curse."
4627480,4633600," I set my kids up to play it takes to in the car at one point and they were like, Hey,"
4633600,4634600," what happened to our game?"
4634600,4635600," I was like, I don't know."
4635600,4638320," Oh, yeah, it turns out it takes to just doesn't cloud save on steam."
4638320,4639680," It's like just not supported."
4639680,4644840," And then I saw this, I saw this really awful video on, I don't know if it was TikTok or"
4644840,4645840," something."
4645840,4650960," Anyway, someone was, someone was talking about how their animal crossing saved."
4650960,4656240," They had like 500 hours in animal crossing and their switch got corrupted during an update"
4656240,4663280," and it's gone, even though they do pay Nintendo for their stupid hostage taking cloud save"
4663280,4667400," feature, Nintendo was just like, Oh yeah, you have to manually enable animal crossing"
4667400,4669360," saves because they're big."
4669360,4673640," This is a paid service, Nintendo."
4673640,4674640," It's paid."
4674640,4677320," It's actually so brutal."
4677320,4681960," I had seen like people were upset about animal crossing saves, but I didn't know why."
4681960,4685200," That's so brutal."
4685200,4689000," This is something we've actually like almost unbelievable levels of brutal."
4689000,4690520," I'm just hating your customers."
4690520,4692040," Yeah, like what the?"
4692040,4693040," Oh man."
4693040,4697680," Oh, you mentioned when talking about the Mario movie, you're like, Yep, it's good, clean"
4697680,4699480," fun like Nintendo."
4699480,4704320," It sucks that Nintendo has to come with this incredibly ugly downside all the time."
4704320,4705320," Yep."
4705320,4712200," It wouldn't be that hard to just be like a company that's just so super Mario games"
4712200,4713200," expensive."
4713200,4714320," Do they never go on discount?"
4714320,4715480," Yeah, sure."
4715480,4716840," But like, they're always good."
4716840,4721520," You can back up your save to an SD card for no charge because the SD card slot is right"
4721520,4724720," there on the console and why wouldn't we let you do that?"
4724720,4725880," That kind of stuff, right?"
4725880,4731240," Like it seems like it would make sense for the brand, but they just they just can't."
4731240,4735560," It has have to be bottles and it's like, man, why?"
4735560,4736560," I don't know."
4736560,4738480," I do have to bring back."
4738480,4739480," I don't know if you mentioned this."
4739480,4740480," Sorry."
4740480,4744280," I've been working on something, but the this was a hackathon project."
4744280,4745280," Right."
4745280,4751600," So like, I wouldn't take this as a like they're working on it, but there's other cool ideas,"
4751600,4757440," but like driver handling, touch keyboard, controller navigation of keyboard and common"
4757440,4764640," windows elements like task view, controller support outside of steam and more."
4764640,4768920," Like Luke says, this is no guarantee, but the Microsoft employees who made the presentation"
4768920,4774400," seem passionate about it saying that windows and Xbox app users deserve this and need this."
4774400,4775400," They're so right."
4775400,4778760," How have windows and Xbox not merged more?"
4778760,4783600," Yeah, they're even doing a lot of the things right."
4783600,4788720," But not 100% of the way and these hackathons are often positioned to be able to find projects"
4788720,4789720," like this."
4789720,4792960," So it is very possible that this does get done."
4792960,4797040," I just don't want people being like, Oh, this is coming cool because it's not necessarily"
4797040,4798040," coming."
4798040,4801640," There's no word on whether they've started any kind of development on the project, but"
4801640,4806760," as PC world points out, they'd be kind of dumb not to with the proliferation of these"
4806760,4812240," devices and with the gap that valves inertia seems to have left in the market."
4812240,4815680," The ROG ally is outstanding."
4815680,4819440," The amount of time that I've spent with it now is much more than the last time I talked"
4819440,4820440," about it."
4820440,4823600," And like I was just, it's replaced as theme deck for you."
4823600,4828280," Yvonne and I were having one of our one of our home meetings because she can never talk"
4828280,4830720," to me at work because no one will let her."
4830720,4832880," So she it's very hard to get a meeting with you."
4832880,4836680," Yeah, so she's actually like a battle every time."
4836680,4840680," So anyway, she had a whole bunch of stuff in her inbox that was tagged, discussed with"
4840680,4846280," Linus and I was just chilling on the floor in the computer room playing vampire survivors"
4846280,4852600," on the ROG ally with it being completely dead silent in the power saving mode because it's"
4852600,4855200," not a super demanding game."
4855200,4859960," And I mean, it's obviously a pretty like brain turned off kind of game just essentially"
4859960,4861800," having a meeting."
4861800,4867120," It runs so smooth 120 Hertz is way more powerful than the steam."
4867120,4870560," Way way more powerful."
4870560,4872400," And it's not going to be the only one."
4872400,4878800," Is it cool to have a computing device where you had a very significant performance jump"
4878800,4880440," that was noticeable?"
4880440,4884200," Yeah, because I feel like that hasn't super been a thing for a while."
4884200,4888840," But I recognized only just now, but I've had this feeling the whole time you've been talking"
4888840,4889840," about it."
4889840,4890840," Yeah."
4890840,4894120," That there's like a different level of excitement because this like super perceivable jump in"
4894120,4896400," performance is not so much of a thing."
4896400,4897800," No, no, it's not."
4897800,4898800," It's twice as fast."
4898800,4899800," Yeah."
4899800,4900800," That's crazy."
4900800,4902080," And it is still a thing."
4902080,4903400," It is still a thing."
4903400,4909280," And like if if an SSD was twice as fast right now, it wouldn't matter."
4909280,4910840," Most users are not going to notice."
4910840,4911840," But okay."
4911840,4913120," So that's exactly the thing."
4913120,4914440," There are still big upgrades."
4914440,4921600," The 4090 is an enormous upgrade over the 3090 for $1,600 US dollars."
4921600,4922600," Yeah."
4922600,4925680," Starting at starting at for a single component of your computer."
4925680,4928400," But here we're talking about I hope."
4928400,4929400," Okay."
4929400,4935440," I hope we're talking about a device that is under or around a grand, right?"
4935440,4936440," And that's for the whole thing."
4936440,4937440," And it's a complete device."
4937440,4938440," Yes."
4938440,4939440," Yes."
4939440,4940440," It's a complete experience."
4940440,4943040," It's not an ad in board that you put in another thing."
4943040,4944040," Yeah."
4944040,4945440," That also costs a lot of money, right?"
4945440,4949440," And also like needs its own level of heightened support because you need like a crazy power"
4949440,4950960," supply and exactly."
4950960,4953080," And all that cooling and all that kind of stuff."
4953080,4954080," Exactly."
4954080,4956560," No, I'm jazzed."
4956560,4961840," And don't imagine for a second that if a SUS is successful with the ROG ally that you're"
4961840,4966480," not going to see other other PC manufacturers chime in because this is something I was trying"
4966480,4967480," to figure out."
4967480,4969760," It's like, who the heck is I a neo?"
4969760,4971440," Who is one X player?"
4971440,4973920," Who is you know, GPD?"
4973920,4976560," Who are these guys?"
4976560,4978880," And I know who they are."
4978880,4980880," Like I, you know, have communicated with them."
4980880,4981880," I understand who they are."
4981880,4982880," They're actually very directly."
4982880,4985760," But my point was that they are not a SUS."
4985760,4986760," They're not major players."
4986760,4988920," They are not MSI gigabyte."
4988920,4994600," And if these guys can get to market, if the minimum order quantities and the relationship"
4994600,5002520," building with the AMDs or the Intel's of the world is so relatively easy, absolutely"
5002520,5009040," nothing would prevent a manufacturer with the expertise of an Asus MSI gigabyte, Acer,"
5009040,5015640," Dell, whoever, nothing would prevent them from coming out with one."
5015640,5016640," Okay."
5016640,5017960," Do you think this is going to be bad?"
5017960,5019800," It's a laptop, but it doesn't full."
5019800,5020800," Sure."
5020800,5023240," Do you think it's going to be bad for the GPDs, I and EOS, etc."
5023240,5024240," Of the world?"
5024240,5025240," Yeah."
5025240,5026240," That sucks."
5026240,5027440," Hold on."
5027440,5031480," They still have an opportunity to maintain their niche."
5031480,5036440," GPD is the only one who really takes the keyboard seriously."
5036440,5037680," Okay."
5037680,5041520," So there's still room for them."
5041520,5047280," I and Neo, they were doing some really cool things with I of space."
5047280,5051000," So they're their skin slash launcher."
5051000,5053320," Some really cool ideas."
5053320,5059240," They're overlay really cool ideas there for being able to kind of like the Steam deck,"
5059240,5060240," right?"
5060240,5064880," Adjust your brightness and your volume and your power profile and whatever else while"
5064880,5066520," you're in game."
5066520,5068200," Really cool ideas there."
5068200,5074240," I feel like compared to, I don't know, six, eight months ago, it's just kind of more"
5074240,5078920," bloated and buggy and hasn't really added anything useful for me."
5078920,5085440," And so if they can really do a great job of that and make that supplementary to anything"
5085440,5089760," that Microsoft builds into Windows, I think it could be really good."
5089760,5096720," Like I, at their, I and Neo at their best has had way better auto switching of joy to"
5096720,5101120," mouse and then switching into controller mode as you launch games and then go back to the"
5101120,5102120," Windows desktop."
5102120,5106080," But then it got really bad around the time Windows 11 launched, which I would have to"
5106080,5107840," assume is something to do with Microsoft."
5107840,5108840," Thank you very much."
5108840,5110600," But I don't know that for sure."
5110600,5113840," Whereas a SUSE right now, it's pretty rough."
5113840,5115280," I basically just use a touch."
5115280,5116280," Right."
5116280,5117280," Like it sucks."
5117280,5119280," Like they have a toggle for it, but as far as I can tell, it doesn't work."
5119280,5123320," And there's room for these companies, absolutely room for these companies to have acquisitions"
5123320,5124320," happen."
5124320,5128880," You even mentioned like, there's all these major players in the space that could do it,"
5128880,5131640," but there's like software advantages or whatever that these small companies have."
5131640,5133960," That's like exactly why those things happen."
5133960,5135320," Yeah, 100%."
5135320,5140240," But then if I'm, I don't think it would though, like I'm thinking everything I know about"
5140240,5141880," MSI and their product development."
5141880,5143440," Oh, I don't think MSI would do it."
5143440,5146720," I think they would just be like, no, we'll do it ourselves."
5146720,5148560," And it doesn't matter if it's crappy."
5148560,5149560," Like alien wear."
5149560,5150560," Okay."
5150560,5157920," Would, would, no, Dell would build it themselves and it would be less crappy."
5157920,5158920," But then MSI."
5158920,5159920," Yeah."
5159920,5160920," Like it just dang."
5160920,5167280," What is it about hardware companies and just be utterly unable to do software?"
5167280,5173280," It's actually like, I don't find that there's a ton of companies that can do both."
5173280,5175040," It's actually kind of difficult to cross over."
5175040,5176040," Yeah."
5176040,5179200," Because Apple, you know, the first to cross a trillion dollar valuation."
5179200,5180200," Yeah."
5180200,5181360," Because they can do both."
5181360,5182360," It's hard."
5182360,5183360," Yeah."
5183360,5192320," Intel software is like their consumer facing software is kind of janky."
5192320,5195360," I'm talking about the, the ARK stuff."
5195360,5196360," Yeah."
5196360,5197360," Yeah."
5197360,5201600," Like there's definitely software things that I'm pretty sure Intel does pretty well."
5201600,5206120," Like my, my understanding is a lot of their like compiler stuff is very robust."
5206120,5210840," A lot of their like hardcore behind the scenes type of stuff is pretty solid."
5210840,5212480," A lot of their user facing stuff."
5212480,5217280," The UIs look like they're from the early 2000s."
5217280,5218280," Whatever you was even calling them."
5218280,5219280," And that's when they work."
5219280,5222520," Art control or whatever was a hot pile of garbage."
5222520,5223520," Yeah."
5223520,5225560," I don't know."
5225560,5230560," They feel extremely not modern on the user side or completely broken in regards to."
5230560,5234280," When you look at like a software company like Facebook trying to do hardware."
5234280,5236000," It's like a portal."
5236000,5237000," Yeah."
5237000,5238920," Like it's, it's actually pretty hard to cross."
5238920,5243400," I mean, they technically do hardware now, but they acquired Oculus and what have they"
5243400,5249080," realistically launched as meta?"
5249080,5250880," Like developed and launched."
5250880,5251880," Okay."
5251880,5252880," So."
5252880,5255160," I mean, yeah, they've done headsets."
5255160,5259080," They still, yeah, but they still had a lot of the Oculus team when they developed, you"
5259080,5261680," know, Rift S or when they developed Quest one."
5261680,5262680," Oh, I see."
5262680,5264880," So the pro is like the only."
5264880,5265880," Yeah."
5265880,5270520," And it's a flop as far as I can tell."
5270520,5274280," That doesn't, it's not a bad device, but it's not commercially viable."
5274280,5276080," Someone saying their driver support is normally amazing."
5276080,5277080," Yeah."
5277080,5280040," Like the behind the scenes stuff from Intel is, is traditionally quite good."
5280040,5281040," Yeah."
5281040,5282760," Oh, well, 100% give them that."
5282760,5285680," It's more the, the user facing stuff."
5285680,5287400," Anyways, new topic."
5287400,5294240," Just like our sponsors face our users, massive shout out to JumpCloud for sponsoring this"

5417640,5422440," It also uses a fluid dynamic bearing fan which contributes to quietness and also to longevity."
5422440,5424240," It comes with a 12 year warranty."
5424240,5427800," So if you're looking for, to build a new system and looking for a power supply you can rely"
5427800,5431160," on, trust me, you can trust Seasonic."
5431160,5434720," I mean, yeah, these guys have been added as long as I have."
5434720,5436200," They were founded the same year I was born."
5436200,5437200," Oh wow."
5437200,5440800," Yeah, learn more about them at Seasonic.com or through the link down below."
5440800,5443560," It was always really confusing to me, Seasonic."
5443560,5445640," The fact that they had no retail presence."
5445640,5447960," Like I'm talking 15 years ago or whatever."
5447960,5453960," When it was obvious that everyone who made a decent power supply was using either them"
5453960,5456040," or a handful of other OEMs."
5456040,5459600," And I'm kind of going, let me buy direct, man."
5459600,5467440," Is it really that hard to spray a coat of black paint on your boring gray power supply?"
5467440,5471320," Put a little bit of sleeving on the cable and make a box."
5471320,5472320," You know?"
5472320,5474320," Because as far as I can tell, that's what everyone's..."
5474320,5476400," It has what everyone else is doing."
5476400,5478360," Apparently, Seasonic had the same idea."
5478360,5480360," It's like, oh, okay."
5480360,5481840," I guess we'll do that."
5481840,5484120," It really doesn't seem that hard."
5484120,5485720," Why are we letting Corsair have all the fun?"
5485720,5489720," Which I'm happy about because something that I legitimately used to do was look into who"
5489720,5494320," made the power supply I was buying to figure out what the like basically cheapest actually"
5494320,5496240," Seasonic option was at the time."
5496240,5497240," Yeah."
5497240,5498240," And then just buy that."
5498240,5499240," So now it's just more simple."
5499240,5504080," Yeah, like when XFX broke into the power supply market, their whole claim to fame was"
5504080,5510120," unlike Corsair who has moved on and is using other OEMs now, all of ours are Seasonic."
5510120,5511120," Yeah."
5511120,5512120," So, okay."
5512120,5514480," Actually a selling point for a bunch of people."
5514480,5518120," I would totally do an LTT power supply just made by Seasonic."
5518120,5520280," I'd be super into that."
5520280,5521280," And I wouldn't even hide it."
5521280,5524560," I'd be like, yeah, it costs more so that we get our cut."
5524560,5526280," It's Seasonic."
5526280,5528480," It's now like partially orange or something."
5528480,5529680," Yeah, exactly."
5529680,5534040," No, no, because it would have to be RGB so it matches everyone's system."
5534040,5536840," It's just that the RGB would be configured out of the box or by default."
5536840,5537840," Yeah, there we go."
5537840,5539200," Yeah, that's what makes an LTT."
5539200,5540200," Boom, done."
5540200,5541200," Easy."
5541200,5545280," But then at that point, why don't we just sell Seasonic power supplies on LTTstore.com."
5545280,5548160," Hey, there's a plan."
5548160,5551560," Yeah, I'd be down the good."
5551560,5554360," Three merch messages is apparently the current task."
5554360,5555360," All right."
5555360,5557000," Hey, that's what some merch messages, but Dan."
5557000,5558000," I feel like I'm doing this."
5558000,5562120," All right, this one is a little bit anonymous, obviously, and is probably directed towards"
5562120,5563720," Luke."
5563720,5569560," He's AI generated adult content, a more ethical solution than current adult industry and only"
5569560,5570560," fans."
5570560,5571560," Wow."
5571560,5572560," Wow, what a quagmire."
5572560,5573560," Wow."
5573560,5576760," All right, well, I'm glad you said this was pun intended, by the way."
5576760,5579160," I'm glad you said this was directed at Luke."
5579160,5582320," I'm just going to dodge that bullet."
5582320,5583320," Oh, wow."
5583320,5586880," Let's let the internet freak out at you for a chance."
5586880,5589160," Let me re-read this."
5589160,5596600," For ethical solution than current adult industry and only fans, there is a ton to unpack here."
5596600,5601600," I think it would be less ethical in a bunch of ways, potentially more ethical in other"
5601600,5602600," ways."
5602600,5607560," I think it's super convoluted."
5607560,5611320," There are definitely only fans things."
5611320,5612320," Wow."
5612320,5615800," This entirely depends on how you define your ethics."
5615800,5623160," I have seen a lot of people comment about how only fans has enabled certain creators to"
5623160,5627360," be much more safe in what they do to have more ownership over their own stuff."
5627360,5629200," They don't have to work through other companies anymore."
5629200,5632960," They don't have to necessarily work with other people at all anymore."
5632960,5635480," They can just operate on their own regard."
5635480,5637520," So I've heard good things about that."
5637520,5639680," Does AI solve that?"
5639680,5640680," No."
5640680,5642840," So I don't know."
5642840,5647480," So there's a topic we're going to be talking about later, more specifically in the realm"
5647480,5658040," of music, but AI has been AI models, whatever, has been used to deep fake people that gave"
5658040,5662080," no consent and were clearly not okay with it at all."
5662080,5664320," So that's clearly ethically bad."
5664320,5665680," I don't care where your ethics lie."
5665680,5669000," That's just clearly not okay."
5669000,5673720," And these AI models are trained off of image data sets that include real people."
5673720,5678160," Are they capable of generating stuff completely originally?"
5678160,5682840," Well, they're going to base it off of things that they learnt from people, but it could"
5682840,5687560," look genuinely literally nothing like anyone else that currently exists."
5687560,5691880," So that's cool, I guess."
5691880,5695960," My understanding, not that I speak from personal experience, but my understanding is that the"
5695960,5702600," pornography industry is extremely predisposed towards exploitive practices."
5702600,5703600," Yeah."
5703600,5705080," Which I've heard a lot of very bad things."
5705080,5707120," Which kind of checks out."
5707120,5712880," But I've also heard that there's good things, but you might be against the entire thing."
5712880,5717240," So I don't know."
5717240,5724440," I mean, at the end of the day, there's a fine line between understanding that people have"
5724440,5727520," agency and can make their own decisions."
5727520,5728520," Yes."
5728520,5735920," While also protecting people who would make extremely self-harmful decisions that would"
5735920,5739760," allow them to be exploited by ne'er-do-wells."
5739760,5744520," Also bad people saying that certain person involved with something has their own agency"
5744520,5746040," and is free when that person isn't."
5746040,5747720," It's totally a thing that happens."
5747720,5749120," That's totally bad."
5749120,5751000," Yep."
5751000,5752000," This is a minefield."
5752000,5755080," Let's move on."
5755080,5756080," Next question."
5756080,5757800," Really, because I was going to throw another curveball at you."
5757800,5766880," I was going to say even if the AI generated content only accidentally looked like someone"
5766880,5769760," and wasn't intentionally trained on an individual."
5769760,5771560," That's still a problem."
5771560,5774400," How could you even prevent that?"
5774400,5778120," But then there's also people that look like other people."
5778120,5779120," Yeah."
5779120,5780600," That label their stuff as that other person."
5780600,5781600," Oh, right."
5781600,5782600," Yep."
5782600,5784720," Okay."
5784720,5785720," This is a minefield."
5785720,5786720," Alright, Celia."
5786720,5788640," Let's move on."
5788640,5791080," Okay, up next."
5791080,5792600," Hey, DLL."
5792600,5798640," As calibration tech, as a calibration tech, I often see settings hidden behind proprietary"
5798640,5799640," information."
5799640,5801280," Do you feel this is okay?"
5801280,5803760," Or should it fall under right to repair?"
5803760,5806240," And will the labs equipment be calibrated?"
5806240,5807560," Well, okay."
5807560,5811560," For starters, the labs equipment must be calibrated because otherwise how could we trust"
5811560,5814360," any of the results that come out of it?"
5814360,5820600," For another equipment calibration is a tough one because on the one hand, yes, everything"
5820600,5821680," is right to repair."
5821680,5830560," I saw another merge message about, for example, even just like hidden menus and TVs and stuff"
5830560,5835080," like that that isn't to do with calibration, but it's just to access settings that are"
5835080,5836480," not considered safe."
5836480,5842400," For example, my LG TV that I was using as a monitor, there was a special service remote"
5842400,5846880," you could get to access a special menu that would allow you to turn off some of the OLED"
5846880,5851000," saver technology so that it would function better as a monitor."
5851000,5857880," Obviously, I think I should be allowed to use my hardware however I want to use it."
5857880,5861000," But on the other hand, well, who is responsible then?"
5861000,5864480," Who is verifying the integrity of this calibration?"
5864480,5875520," Unless there's some kind of validation or certification process, is it calibrated?"
5875520,5878960," I could see a compromise being that everyone should have access to the menu."
5878960,5880920," So wait, are you talking about labs equipment?"
5880920,5881920," Yeah."
5881920,5882920," Okay."
5882920,5883920," Yeah."
5883920,5884920," You're not talking about the TV anymore?"
5884920,5885920," No."
5885920,5886920," No."
5886920,5892720," I could see a compromise being that they allow you to have access to all the same menus and"
5892720,5897040," IO ports or whatever else it is."
5897040,5901880," I think that they should provide the equipment and the training if you want to do it yourself."
5901880,5906680," But I think that it could make sense for them to have a program where they're the ones who"
5906680,5912280," do it and they have their own sort of certification that they will apply to it."
5912280,5918640," There could be a log that you can't modify or delete that notes changes made to certain"
5918640,5925320," calibration settings and whether that change was made by an improved agent or not."
5925320,5927760," Because yeah, you should absolutely be able to change it yourself."
5927760,5933560," But that doesn't mean it's verified calibration by whatever authority."
5933560,5934560," But that might be fine."
5934560,5935560," You might not care about that."
5935560,5938560," You should still be able to do it, in my opinion."
5938560,5941280," Do you want another one?"
5941280,5942280," Yeah."
5942280,5943280," All right."
5943280,5944280," Here's our third."
5944280,5946480," This one is another anonymous."
5946480,5947480," Hey."
5947480,5950080," Oh, no, somebody reordered them."
5950080,5954720," I think many people are shocked by LTT store prices because they're unfamiliar with the"
5954720,5957880," higher end of the markets you compete in."
5957880,5963080," Have you ever been shocked by prices in unfamiliar markets before?"
5963080,5964720," Oh, sure."
5964720,5971440," I mean, I made a whole video about what the heck is going on with cinema camera prices"
5971440,5975560," and the craziest part is red was a disruptor."
5975560,5982480," Get your mind around that."
5982480,5989600," Red came in and undercut the cinema market, the cinema camera market."
5989600,5999920," They democratized the creation of a high resolution, like filmic resolution digital cinema."
5999920,6005080," We talked earlier on this show about an MSRP $35,000 graphics card."
6005080,6006080," Right."
6006080,6007080," Yeah."
6007080,6008400," That was probably shocking for a bunch of people watching."
6008400,6009400," Yeah."
6009400,6013720," I mean, it's, I remember talking about this on the WAN show at some point."
6013720,6015280," I think I talked about this on the WAN show."
6015280,6021120," I remember being called very out of touch for saying something along the lines of consumer"
6021120,6023320," computer hardware is not expensive."
6023320,6025080," Oh, yeah."
6025080,6034760," Because from a business standpoint, it's not a GPU in the when you, you got to everything"
6034760,6037160," is relative, right?"
6037160,6043960," A GPU costs nothing to an organization like us in the grand scheme of things."
6043960,6046320," Think about how many people were to employee salary."
6046320,6055920," We're up to about benefits for for for someone to be in the building for a pay period."
6055920,6056920," Okay."
6056920,6060240," It's like GPU, right?"
6060240,6067040," And then, okay, well, that times, you know, 26 times a year."
6067040,6069920," Like it still matters."
6069920,6070920," Yeah."
6070920,6078080," Like every headcount we add is like equipping a quarter of our staff with an RTX 4090."
6078080,6079080," Think about that."
6079080,6080080," Yeah."
6080080,6081080," Yeah."
6081080,6082080," Right."
6082080,6089480," So consumer electronics, what I meant was for what they are, it's amazing how little"
6089480,6097200," they cost when we look at what we got for a thousand dollars back in 1995."
6097200,6106720," The fact that you can, the fact that you can buy a 4070 Ti for a thousand dollars is mind"
6106720,6109400," blowing the technological advancements."
6109400,6110400," Right."
6110400,6115160," The, I think the, the like most easy to visualize version of that was when you talk about storage,"
6115160,6116360," people do this all the time."
6116360,6117960," So this is not original at all."
6117960,6122960," So you look at like old hard drives, like this is how many hard drives it would have"
6122960,6128680," taken in 1998 to amass a terabyte worth of data."
6128680,6129680," Yeah."
6129680,6132160," And there's like a one terabyte micro SD card."
6132160,6133160," Here you go."
6133160,6134160," It's like, whoa."
6134160,6135160," It's wild."
6135160,6136160," Yeah."
6136160,6137160," People are talking about this now."
6137160,6140960," It's like DS2600 and float plane chat says, I just bought a Cisco router for 1.2 million"
6140960,6142400," for my company."
6142400,6144400," Is that outrageous?"
6144400,6148000," Not if your company is going to generate $6 million of revenue with it."
6148000,6149440," Cause that's the thing."
6149440,6151960," It's a completely different calculus."
6151960,6157640," It's not how much enjoyment will I get from this router or from this add in card."
6157640,6160280," It's how much revenue will this generate for the company?"
6160280,6166200," If I spend this thousand dollars that I am, that I'm blessed enough to have to reinvest,"
6166200,6174120," will I get $1,100 or $1,500 or $3,000 assuming that I make very efficient use of it?"
6174120,6178000," So I forget how we started this question."
6178000,6179000," What was the question?"
6179000,6182200," Oh yeah, the pricing of, so have we ever, yeah."
6182200,6183200," Yeah."
6183200,6190800," So in the, when it comes to business expenses, I don't think a quarter goes by where I'm not"
6190800,6196440," blown away by the cost of something because once you reach a certain scale, things that"
6196440,6199800," cost $1,000 become a rounding error."
6199800,6206120," Like I remember we got a bill for some kind of stock photo service that we were using,"
6206120,6210760," but we didn't have the right tier of subscription for like how much of it we were using and"
6210760,6212600," we didn't realize."
6212600,6217680," And they sent us like a $30,000 bill."
6217680,6223960," And I was like, uh, what?"
6223960,6226600," This happens with web service stuff like all the time."
6226600,6228000," Oh yeah, for sure."
6228000,6229000," Yeah."
6229000,6230720," No, yeah, it happens all the time."
6230720,6236800," And I mean, my response to people saying that LTT store stuff is really expensive is,"
6236800,6243000," um, okay, well, uh, you, you go make it to that level of quality at that price."
6243000,6245320," Our T-shirts are still 20 bucks."
6245320,6247280," Go find now."
6247280,6251920," Go find me another content creator that does printed quality shirts."
6251920,6258880," No fruit of the loom, no gilden, no crapshirts printed quality shirts for printing to 20 bucks."
6258880,6261560," Clean printed, not direct to garment."
6261560,6264960," It costs money."
6264960,6266720," Sorry, not sorry."
6266720,6271120," Like we don't, we don't take ridiculous margin on stuff."
6271120,6275160," Um, that's just the way it is."
6275160,6277800," We're doing one more."
6277800,6278800," We doing topics."
6278800,6279800," Let's do one more."
6279800,6280800," Actually, yeah."
6280800,6281800," Let's do one more."
6281800,6284800," We're ahead of time."
6284800,6285800," Yeah."
6285800,6288280," Just a little bit."
6288280,6290040," I, uh, I got my time."
6290040,6291040," It's Ron."
6291040,6292040," All right."
6292040,6293040," Next up's from Jacob."
6293040,6297320," Linus, who is a source of personal or professional inspiration for you?"
6297320,6302440," Not a role model, just someone with certain traits you admire and try to emulate."
6302440,6305200," Strangers it may seem you're on my list."
6305200,6307720," Oh, well, I'm very flattered."
6307720,6308720," Thank you."
6308720,6309720," Um, bad choice."
6309720,6310720," Just kidding."
6310720,6320240," You're going to do the like rubbing thing."
6320240,6322040," No, I refuse."
6322040,6325960," Oh man."
6325960,6333400," My thing is that I don't have a lot of time."
6333400,6337960," I follow very few things."
6337960,6339520," Yeah."
6339520,6344840," So I'm at risk right now of saying a name only to find out that."
6344840,6346320," This is a huge problem."
6346320,6347320," Yeah."
6347320,6349600," I was at a Michael Bubli concert a little while back."
6349600,6350600," Yeah."
6350600,6355240," And he does a whole tribute to Elvis Presley and what a great person he was."
6355240,6358080," And I was like, no, that doesn't sound right."
6358080,6359080," Is that true?"
6359080,6360080," Yeah."
6360080,6361080," Oh, oh."
6361080,6365000," I have no idea."
6365000,6367480," I believe you."
6367480,6375120," Everything I can glean all these years later, you know, with the wonderful world of Wikipedia"
6375120,6380440," and, you know, memoirs and knowing that he's, you know, deceased and not able to defend"
6380440,6383320," himself these days."
6383320,6384320," Real creep."
6384320,6385320," Oh boy."
6385320,6386320," Okay."
6386320,6387320," Yeah."
6387320,6388320," Music innovator, certainly."
6388320,6389320," Sure."
6389320,6390960," I thought he like stole that too."
6390960,6391960," Real creep."
6391960,6392960," Um, I don't know."
6392960,6393960," I know nothing about it."
6393960,6394960," Yeah."
6394960,6400360," So there's, there's the whole like 14 year old girlfriend and oh boy, sort of super cool"
6400360,6402160," stuff like that."
6402160,6406120," And I don't think you can, I don't think you can really just different time hand wave"
6406120,6407280," that away."
6407280,6410320," So I'm kind of at risk right now."
6410320,6417000," But what I would like to say is maybe what I could do is I could point to a couple of,"
6417000,6421600," of role models that seem pretty okay from what I've seen."
6421600,6427640," The Sadeen brothers who played for the Vancouver Canucks, not a huge organized sports fan these"
6427640,6434760," days just because it, it's, and again, this might just be my cynicism showing through,"
6434760,6441040," but I just can't help but look at it as yet another business full of brands owned by"
6441040,6445480," billionaires who don't even treat this as their main project in a lot of cases."
6445480,6449040," It's just like a silly little side vanity project for them."
6449040,6451800," Like it's just, it all just kind of sucks."
6451800,6455720," The way the players are treated like cattle, well paid cattle, well compensated cattle"
6455720,6460800," in a lot of cases, sometimes not, but cattle."
6460800,6467040," The whole thing just makes me really uncomfortable, but the Sadeen brothers seem to be actually"
6467040,6468040," pretty cool."
6468040,6469040," Yeah."
6469040,6476400," Oh, a borno says you've mentioned Bill Watersons for 100% for all I know he kills cats."
6476400,6477880," I don't know him personally, right?"
6477880,6479480," Like I don't know him."
6479480,6480960," They say never meet your heroes."
6480960,6482520," I'm pretty sure."
6482520,6487480," There's also a difference like, I don't know, for me people in this position, it doesn't"
6487480,6490000," mean I fanboy over them."
6490000,6491760," I'd fanboy over Bill Watersons."
6491760,6493600," Yeah, they got me."
6493600,6495600," They got me on that one."
6495600,6498080," He seems pretty cool."
6498080,6500360," Fanboy is a pretty intense term."
6500360,6502600," If you take it to like, it's potential."
6502600,6504360," My hands would be shaking."
6504360,6505360," Okay."
6505360,6510360," Like I play it cool, but like I would have to be consciously playing it cool."
6510360,6512400," I'd be like, \"Study to this person's life.\""
6512400,6513400," No, but--"
6513400,6515240," Their works maybe, but their life."
6515240,6519320," Like I know enough about his personal life to know that he maintains a pretty quiet existence."
6519320,6522720," Yeah, but that's like, blasted everywhere if you ever look at his name."
6522720,6525760," Yeah, but I've looked up his name, so I've, you know, I've gone that far."
6525760,6526760," Yeah, I don't know."
6526760,6531280," I think people could take this stuff pretty far, but maybe I'm applying too much to it."
6531280,6532280," Yeah."
6532280,6537120," Justing some pretty decent-- people have got some pretty decent suggestions."
6537120,6544440," You know, Mr. Rogers actually seems to have legitimately just been a good decent human being."
6544440,6546040," Yeah."
6546040,6547440," Yeah."
6547440,6552200," Good luck meeting Bill Watersons."
6552200,6553440," He's like the Phantom, yeah."
6553440,6554440," Yeah."
6554440,6555440," 100%."
6555440,6558760," I wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't even do a book tour for his upcoming graphic novel,"
6558760,6560280," which I have pre-ordered."
6560280,6563360," And though I always say don't pre-order."
6563360,6565560," All right."
6565560,6571320," Two to three more topics."
6571320,6572320," Yeah."
6572320,6574800," All right, hit me."
6574800,6578520," I don't even know if we have three more topics."
6578520,6579840," Oh, okay."
6579840,6582480," The RTX 4070 was released."
6582480,6586840," And can I say, I think we finally managed to nail a GPU review?"
6586840,6587840," Yeah."
6587840,6589200," I think you can."
6589200,6590200," Yeah."
6590200,6599800," We managed to get all the synergies lined up between the lab and the rating team."
6599800,6604120," They've got a lot of their data collection nailed down better."
6604120,6610240," We've got a lot of our processes in terms of ingesting that data and turning it into"
6610240,6616880," the important beats that matter in video form rather than just being a written article"
6616880,6618960," that we read out to the camera."
6618960,6626520," So I think we managed to maintain the LTT soul while also authoritatively speaking based"
6626520,6632440," on rock solid data about what you need to know about this product."
6632440,6641000," I think we did a great job of figuring out where the RTX 4070 fits in both Nvidia's plan"
6641000,6646720," as well as in sort of gamers worlds."
6646720,6649360," I'm really, really happy."
6649360,6655280," The next level for us is to have supplementary written articles on lttlabs.com."
6655280,6658240," But that's we've got it in our sites."
6658240,6660400," It doesn't need to happen yet."
6660400,6666720," I think there's I think there's room for us to go in more depth in the right medium for"
6666720,6668760," that kind of additional depth."
6668760,6673800," But that is what I want a GPU review video to be."
6673800,6679840," But you need to know with good energy in a non confusing way."
6679840,6684120," And I'm really glad that we did manage to nail it on the RTX 4070 because there was"
6684120,6686880," a ton of room for us to get this one wrong."
6686880,6690680," I think that we did a better job than we've done in the past of presenting both sides"
6690680,6691680," of the story."
6691680,6701000," I think that during the GPU pricing crisis that took place during the pandemic, we were"
6701000,6708800," kind of I don't know, realists about the situation."
6708800,6716600," Like yeah, the only answer is wait and like sorry, but people didn't like me saying look"
6716600,6718520," there's nothing I can do about this."
6718520,6720320," This is the way that it is."
6720320,6725400," And in the context of the market as it is right now, this is a good deal or you know,"
6725400,6729240," like I could I could sit and complain about this, but it's not going to do anything."
6729240,6733840," People didn't like sort of that defeatist sort of attitude."
6733840,6737160," But then we also can't just whine."
6737160,6738280," That's not constructive."
6738280,6743360," It does absolutely nothing other than be fatiguing for everyone who's near it."
6743360,6746800," But it's just yeah, there's there is genuinely nothing we can really do."
6746800,6752080," So I feel like what we did better with the RTX 4070 is we empathize better."
6752080,6753640," There was there was one video in particular."
6753640,6758180," I can't remember which one it was where we just we did a we did kind of a post mortem"
6758180,6759180," on it."
6759180,6764120," So what did we get wrong here because we didn't say anything that was actually incorrect."
6764120,6766240," But people didn't want to hear it."
6766240,6771520," And I'm reminded of that bit in Rick and Morty where Rick says something."
6771520,6773040," I don't remember what it is."
6773040,6777200," And Morty basically says, you know, yeah, no one cares if you're right because you're"
6777200,6779720," an right."
6779720,6783840," And so we kind of looked at it and we went, yeah, this was this was a little bit so it"
6783840,6785040," was a little too abrasive."
6785040,6789300," Like we've got to we've got to take a more empathizing tone where we're delivering the"
6789300,6790300," bad news."
6790300,6796620," The 4070, the bad news is that this is a super tepid GPU."
6796620,6801900," But we're finding a way to tell the good parts of the story and that in that it is the best"
6801900,6806220," value we've seen in a long time."
6806220,6809700," So if you must have a GPU today kind of lame as that is."
6809700,6810700," Yeah."
6810700,6813940," You guess you're good to go."
6813940,6817000," Or you could pick up a 6800 just saying."
6817000,6820940," So if you must have a GPU today, I guess it's, it's, you know, the best deal from Nvidia"
6820940,6823700," and in quite some time."
6823700,6829900," But we're tempering that with the reality that Nvidia shapes the GPU market and can"
6829900,6834940," make something a good deal or a bad deal."
6834940,6840140," Anyway, there's a blah, blah, blah launch this week to deeply mixed reception and video"
6840140,6843260," has been advertising it as a major jump."
6843260,6847820," I mean, that's only in games that support DLSS three frame generation."
6847820,6850940," I mean, I'm calling it, I guess."
6850940,6854860," I don't think that's ever going to take off in the competitive scene."
6854860,6857380," I just don't think it's realistic."
6857380,6861920," More latency, more bad, especially if you're going to spend a half of your time talking"
6861920,6866220," out of this side of your mouth, marketing, you know, Nvidia reflex."
6866220,6870460," You can't spend the other half of your time talking out of this side of your mouth with,"
6870460,6876260," you know, DLSS three beautification as long as you're talking to two very different gamers,"
6876260,6878260," then I guess it's okay."
6878260,6883700," But for competition, DLSS three is never going to matter for experiential games."
6883700,6885620," It might get pretty okay."
6885620,6891300," Yeah, because without frame generation is closer to a 1.3 X performance increase."
6891300,6895340," The new graphics card is also $100 more expensive than the previous gen card was at launch,"
6895340,6899260," despite the fact that discrete graphics sales have been dropping for over a year and hit"
6899260,6904300," a 20 year low last financial quarter."
6904300,6908580," Discussion question here is what do the shrinking differences between graphics card generations"
6908580,6910140," mean for the future of the market?"
6910140,6912900," I mean, longer upgrade cycles?"
6912900,6914820," Yeah, longer upgrade cycles."
6914820,6920860," And I think a shift from game developers towards targeting a lower spec, right?"
6920860,6923540," Like we're not, I don't think we're ever going to see a crisis again."
6923540,6925580," I see our YSIS."
6925580,6928420," I don't think we're ever going to see, I don't think we're going to ever have that moment"
6928420,6933220," again, where a game developer goes out of their way to create a game that literally"
6933220,6935540," nothing on the market can run."
6935540,6936540," Yeah."
6936540,6937540," Because why would you do that?"
6937540,6940340," You'd be so much better off targeting the Steam deck."
6940340,6941340," Yeah."
6941340,6945460," You can create a pretty visually stunning game that will run on the Steam deck and has this"
6945460,6948860," built in audience of people sitting there on their handhelds going, what am I going"
6948860,6950340," to play on this thing now?"
6950340,6953100," Let's go."
6953100,6954700," It's the console mentality."
6954700,6956660," It's totally different, right?"
6956660,6961740," Also, I think that's been kind of the idea for quite a while, to be honest."
6961740,6962740," Like a long time."
6962740,6965060," Yeah, I mean, look at the super popular games right now."
6965060,6967740," The word we have for it is esports titles."
6967740,6968740," Yeah."
6968740,6970700," It's targeting esports tier."
6970700,6974620," So basically making sure that it can run on anything and then adding some bells and"
6974620,6978620," whistles that realistically nobody's going to turn on anyway because they want to compete."
6978620,6979620," Yeah."
6979620,6982500," And it's all like Fortnite and stuff."
6982500,6984500," Like, I don't know."
6984500,6985500," Yeah."
6985500,6986500," Not difficult at all to run."
6986500,6990060," There's a friend of mine who was shopping for a laptop recently and they were asking"
6990060,6995260," about like specs of dedicated GPUs and they mentioned like, these are the games that I"
6995260,6996260," play."
6996260,6997820," I'm like, yeah, you don't need a dedicated GPU."
6997820,6998820," Ben, don't upgrade."
6998820,7003020," Well, they do need a laptop and they don't need a dedicated GPU in their laptop because"
7003020,7006060," they don't have a laptop right now and they need a laptop in general."
7006060,7008220," But like the games that they're like little indie titles."
7008220,7012180," Yeah, speaking of vampire survivors, I'm pretty sure I could run that on board graphics."
7012180,7013180," Yeah."
7013180,7014180," So like whatever."
7014180,7019020," Stuff and then original like whatever it was 1999 EverQuest."
7019020,7021660," I'm like, yeah, that'll run fine."
7021660,7022660," Like whatever."
7022660,7026020," People are talking about Cyberpunk, some of the Sony ports."
7026020,7029860," The difference is that crisis wasn't just poorly optimized."
7029860,7030860," Ha ha."
7030860,7031860," Get on."
7031860,7039260," It was also a leap forward visually, the likes of which we saw at times like Half-Life"
7039260,7041260," 2 wasn't such a visual leap."
7041260,7047340," It was more of just like it was a gameplay leap for sure."
7047340,7049780," Doom from that era was what was it?"
7049780,7054900," Doom 3 or whatever the one at that time was like visually really cool when you had your"
7054900,7055900," flashlight on."
7055900,7062300," Like I'm trying to think like what was like really, really mind blowing?"
7062300,7066100," I mean, Far Cry blew my mind."
7066100,7071740," It was the first like next gen shooter of the big three at the time, which was your Half-Life"
7071740,7073660," 2, your Doom 3 and your Far Cry."
7073660,7074660," And no one saw it coming."
7074660,7075660," It came out of nowhere."
7075660,7077980," That's Crytek again."
7077980,7083700," I am not that familiar with stuff that came before though because I wasn't really a PC"
7083700,7091940," game or other than just like 2D casual games until, you know, ATI is 90, 9000 series, the"
7091940,7093780," old 9000 series."
7093780,7096020," And I got a discrete GPU like I didn't."
7096020,7100420," I played some stuff that I wasn't purchasing hardware."
7100420,7104180," So it was just like whatever the computers that my dad had could run."
7104180,7105180," Yes, I remember."
7105180,7108660," Back then it was like descent and like old school like Civ 1 and stuff like that."
7108660,7114740," You know what Cyberpunk has that ray tracing overdrive mode that I guess is that but I"
7114740,7119260," almost, I don't know, maybe I'm looking at this wrong but I don't really see that as"
7119260,7124980," part of the base game, the same way that just like a graphics slider at release was like"
7124980,7128500," where you're where it came out targeting hardware that didn't exist."
7128500,7129900," That's why I said that that's new."
7129900,7131100," Like it's it doesn't seem fair."
7131100,7133460," They're more trying to keep up."
7133460,7135540," But that's not a bad that's not a bad thing."
7135540,7136540," I'm happy they're doing it."
7136540,7137540," Yeah."
7137540,7141340," I was also going to mention that everyone that I currently know that plays Cyberpunk are"
7141340,7147060," people that also play like Star Citizen and whatever else."
7147060,7149940," And you can tell like the reason why they like playing games is so they can make that"
7149940,7152540," GPU burn."
7152540,7158180," And they want like super hyper visual realism and like all this other type of stuff."
7158180,7160420," Not necessarily because they're actually like enjoying the game."
7160420,7161420," Right."
7161420,7162620," So they're basically a me or a Jake."
7162620,7163620," Yeah."
7163620,7166060," They like setting things up and like soon them run."
7166060,7167620," Like morphologist."
7167620,7169260," We played Star Citizen with him."
7169260,7173060," He posted some screenshot but like wow, Cyberpunk's amazing because he turned on the new ray tracing"
7173060,7174860," thing and I was like, yep."
7174860,7175860," Yep."
7175860,7176860," Not not surprised."
7176860,7179300," That makes sense."
7179300,7180300," Yeah."
7180300,7181300," You topic?"
7181300,7182300," Oh yeah."
7182300,7183300," Right."
7183300,7186540," New topic."
7186540,7188700," This is great."
7188700,7196180," Universal music group saw this on Ars Technica demands that platforms block AI scraping of"
7196180,7198620," music."
7198620,7205820," So they have apparently told streaming platforms like Apple music and Spotify to block AI services"
7205820,7210420," from scraping melodies and lyrics from songs that it holds the copyright to."
7210420,7211660," Bro."
7211660,7218340," That's insanely like impossibly hard to do."
7218340,7224020," Also just utterly."
7224020,7229820," Well I'm looking for a word in effect like what's the strongest possible word for ineffective"
7229820,7230820," futile."
7230820,7233820," Let's go with futile."
7233820,7237060," Do you imagine?"
7237060,7238780," Okay."
7238780,7247040," That just because Spotify and Apple music block this, that there is no other way to"
7247040,7250940," train these music generation AIs on your songs."
7250940,7254980," If you can play a song, there's no way to capture that sound."
7254980,7256140," It's actually impossible."
7256140,7260380," You definitely cannot capture the sound of something that you play through your device."
7260380,7268340," So we'd have to invent a diaphragm that senses sonic air vibrations."
7268340,7271340," That sounds far too complicated."
7271340,7281220," I mean how could you possibly turn that vibration into a signal though?"
7281220,7287980," Especially when it's technically being downloaded to your computer in a raw data state."
7287980,7289620," How could you get that?"
7289620,7291620," Look to produce waves."
7291620,7292740," No that's impossible."
7292740,7294740," That's just messed up."
7294740,7296740," But hold on I think I've got an idea."
7296740,7299900," Back to the idea of the vibrating diaphragm."
7299900,7301980," Maybe if you had magnets involved somehow."
7301980,7304300," But then- How do you get a manufacturer of things this precise?"
7304300,7310180," You'd need some kind of conductive material though that could carry whatever signals back"
7310180,7312060," to some kind of recording device."
7312060,7313060," So we're back to your problem."
7313060,7314060," We would need a recording device."
7314060,7317300," You might need an interface in between there as well to like properly."
7317300,7319340," Or it would wear out."
7319340,7324060," It would wear out because you'd have to have electrons flowing through it."
7324060,7325060," That's a problem."
7325060,7326980," And it would constantly fail."
7326980,7329340," Electrons are basically like they're like energy."
7329340,7331100," I don't know if physics will ever be able to answer this question."
7331100,7333580," Because they're mass and they have a charge."
7333580,7336380," They're like both sides of E equals MC squared."
7336380,7337380," Right."
7337380,7338380," They're mass and energy."
7338380,7339380," Yeah."
7339380,7342700," You can't balance that equated."
7342700,7344660," Anyways."
7344660,7350180," So they've been sending out a large number of takedown notices against AI generated"
7350180,7355780," songs that come from AI's trained on copyrighted materials."
7355780,7360620," According to a universal music spokesperson, we have a moral and commercial responsibility"
7360620,7365180," to our artists to work to prevent the unauthorized use of their music and to stop platforms"
7365180,7369140," from ingesting content that violates the right of artists and other creators."
7369140,7372860," We expect our platform partners will want to prevent their services from being used"
7372860,7374940," in ways that harm artists."
7374940,7375940," Noble goal."
7375940,7376940," It just doesn't matter."
7376940,7377940," Oh, yeah."
7377940,7378940," It's like the six month pause thing."
7378940,7381140," It's like, yeah, I understand why you would want this."
7381140,7382140," Yeah."
7382140,7385140," I understand why universal media group would would universal music groups."
7385140,7388460," Sorry, I applied our own naming scheme to them."
7388460,7390420," I understand why they would want to do this."
7390420,7394260," It's just completely irrelevant and futile, like you mentioned."
7394260,7397140," It just doesn't matter."
7397140,7400660," The discussion question is, is universal music correct in demanding this?"
7400660,7402220," Can they even stop it?"
7402220,7403220," Yeah, probably."
7403220,7404220," Sure."
7404220,7405220," Yeah."
7405220,7406220," Yeah, like from a legal standpoint."
7406220,7407220," Yeah, for sure."
7407220,7408540," They need to try to defend against these things."
7408540,7417180," Like if I was writing a video platform code, okay, and I was just like, hmm, well, why"
7417180,7424140," don't I just steal YouTube and Twitch and Netflix's like source code, use it to train"
7424140,7427220," an AI and then have an AI write a video platform for me."
7427220,7429140," I want to start a new streaming platform."
7429140,7431220," Even if it's legal, it's pretty unethical."
7431220,7432220," Yeah."
7432220,7433820," Twitch recently had this huge leak."
7433820,7435140," I'll just take all their stuff."
7435140,7436140," Oh, well, yeah."
7436140,7437140," Yeah."
7437140,7438140," Okay."
7438140,7439140," Yeah."
7439140,7441140," So even if it was legal and you couldn't prove it, it's extremely unethical."
7441140,7446900," I mean, otherwise, why would we have intellectual property rights at all?"
7446900,7451300," But can they do anything to stop music from being listened to?"
7451300,7455060," Imagine being a universal music group and that being your goal."
7455060,7458660," It's good luck."
7458660,7461340," Quite the pivot."
7461340,7469060," Oh, speaking of video streaming platforms, we should talk about this."
7469060,7471740," It's a little awkward."
7471740,7473580," Got the, oh, yeah."
7473580,7474580," Yeah."
7474580,7475580," Talk about this."
7475580,7481940," I've got a float plane C suite at the table with me and he's giving me the look."
7481940,7482940," Okay."
7482940,7487020," I'm going to put this on you guys right now."
7487020,7490100," Please explain the way that we are leaning."
7490100,7491100," Okay."
7491100,7492740," The way that we're leaning."
7492740,7494300," We have a way we're leaning."
7494300,7496460," That's a way of saying what's happened."
7496460,7497820," Someone dropped their phone."
7497820,7498820," Oh, yeah."
7498820,7504100," I'm assuming that the writers are having their quarterly hangout sash above us."
7504100,7508140," They apparently decided not to go out this time because it's a fixed budget."
7508140,7510500," So they decided not to go out anywhere."
7510500,7512580," And rather than ordering restaurant food."
7512580,7518060," They all went to the grocery store so that they would have way more like snackies and"
7518060,7522500," drinks and they're hanging out at the office where there's no cost."
7522500,7524900," I got to respect it."
7524900,7527060," Give a bunch of engineers a task."
7527060,7528060," Let's be efficient."
7528060,7529060," Yeah."
7529060,7533260," So any who, the way that we're leaning, hard leaning, strong leaning."
7533260,7534260," Yeah."
7534260,7535260," Yeah."
7535260,7544580," So what I'm going to do is that exclusive content will come to YouTube memberships."
7544580,7546460," Full plane exclusive content."
7546460,7547900," That's what we've called it up until now."
7547900,7548900," Yes."
7548900,7549900," FPX."
7549900,7553500," Now, I still like my pitch for how to do the naming with this."
7553500,7554500," But yeah."
7554500,7555500," Naming?"
7555500,7556500," Yeah, you didn't see that bit."
7556500,7557500," Oh, no."
7557500,7561820," I was saying, I mean, when I explained more before I do this, but I was saying we should"
7561820,7564220," still call it full plane exclusives."
7564220,7570060," And then on YouTube, they should be like, oh, what's the proper naming for that these"
7570060,7571060," days?"
7571060,7572060," Member."
7572060,7573060," No."
7573060,7574060," Oh."
7574060,7575620," Like, what's it called?"
7575620,7578460," Elicit market exclusives."
7578460,7582060," Oh, like, like, like dark web, like black market."
7582060,7585580," Like, I don't think that's the, I don't genuinely think that term is like not a thing"
7585580,7586580," anymore."
7586580,7587580," That makes sense."
7587580,7589460," But I don't know what replaced it genuinely."
7589460,7590460," I don't know."
7590460,7591940," But I think the term isn't a thing anymore."
7591940,7594540," But like that, whatever the new term is."
7594540,7595540," Sure."
7595540,7596540," Yeah."
7596540,7597540," I think that would be bootleg."
7597540,7598540," I don't know."
7598540,7599980," Anyway, whatever."
7599980,7605780," So the reasoning for it is that it's been clear to us for a long time that there's a"
7605780,7611900," certain subset of users that are simply not willing to engage off platform."
7611900,7616660," Take for example, oh, of course, it's not there in the tab anymore."
7616660,7618820," But I saw someone send a super chat earlier."
7618820,7619820," Okay."
7619820,7620820," They did."
7620820,7624780," Sorry, trust me, bro."
7624780,7630580," And they must know by this point that we don't respond to them, but just their chosen"
7630580,7633580," way of engaging with us is through the YouTube platform."
7633580,7635300," It's very low friction realistically."
7635300,7638020," They've already given Google their credit card number."
7638020,7641740," They don't have to sign up for third party service, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera."
7641740,7647460," And so for us to not, especially since we have memberships activated on our channel,"
7647460,7653460," for us to not be engaging with those people is a really bad business decision."
7653460,7658980," With that said, there are certain benefits, but we're simply not going to be able to provide"
7658980,7660860," on the YouTube platform."
7660860,7665620," And there are costs that are higher on the YouTube platform than they are on the float"
7665620,7672380," plane platform where our costs are fixed in a sense, as opposed to scaling directly with"
7672380,7673700," our revenue."
7673700,7678900," So the way that we are leaning, the way that I think it's going to work going forward is"
7678900,7685380," YouTube members will get all the same content, all the same exclusive and behind the scenes"
7685380,7690700," and extra cutting room floor content that float plane members get."
7690700,7697180," But there will be a surcharge to compensate for the YouTube cut since it's like not our"
7697180,7702260," platform and there's really nothing in it for us to just take less for some reason because"
7702260,7706980," you want to give your credit card to Google and not to us or whatever."
7706980,7710580," So there will be a surcharge and there won't be a $5 tier."
7710580,7718460," So the $10 4K tier on float plane that gets you access to everything is $10 and is $100"
7718460,7720380," if you buy it for the year."
7720380,7723540," And on YouTube, it'll be $12."
7723540,7727580," And it also won't include the when pre-show vaud."
7727580,7734060," So float plane gets our test streaming before the show that does not go anywhere else."
7734060,7738740," That will still not go to YouTube because there would be no way for us to control if"
7738740,7743180," it went to members only or if it went to everyone once we make the video either public"
7743180,7744740," or members only."
7744740,7746860," It would just be the entire video."
7746860,7749420," It doesn't include any quality improvements."
7749420,7753540," People on float plane often talk about particularly the audio on WAN show how much better it is"
7753540,7755940," on float plane compared to on YouTube."
7755940,7757700," There's no way for us to do that."
7757700,7759860," YouTube is as YouTube does."
7759860,7762100," And right, there's no way for us as far as I can tell."
7762100,7764780," If we can figure out a way to do a yearly discount, we will."
7764780,7768540," But as far as I can tell, there's no way to do a yearly discount."
7768540,7774980," So the point really is going to be to funnel people over to float plane where it's better."
7774980,7778900," But this way, at least there's a way for people to engage on YouTube."
7778900,7784420," To you is just like, you're just like, no, I only use YouTube or whatever, then you have"
7784420,7786340," an option to get our content."
7786340,7788860," Yeah, a lot of people are like that."
7788860,7790300," And I get it."
7790300,7796820," It's like people who shop on Amazon because it's just they have prime and it's convenient."
7796820,7800740," And they only have to go one place like men."
7800740,7804580," Ever since I remember I told you that, you know, one of my resolutions was I'm not going"
7804580,7807060," to stop shopping on Amazon outright like you."
7807060,7808780," But it was like, it's admirable."
7808780,7815580," But my whole thing now is I do a Google search first and I click on at least two websites."
7815580,7820780," And if it's close to the same price, like I'll pay up to like five, 10 bucks more, if it's"
7820780,7825780," close to the same price, I buy it somewhere else."
7825780,7831940," But if Amazon's position in the world is anything to go by, which it is, most people"
7831940,7832940," won't do that."
7832940,7837060," One of the frustrating things for me is when there is literally no other option, when it's"
7837060,7842100," like a company, they like make the best, this is not super common, but it happens."
7842100,7845980," They make like the best thing in their space and it's priced decently well and all that"
7845980,7846980," kind of stuff."
7846980,7851060," Like it's clearly the best option for this widget that you need to buy for whatever reason."
7851060,7853780," But that company only operates through Amazon."
7853780,7859780," It's like that sucks."
7859780,7860780," Okay."
7860780,7863180," Sorry, float plane chat."
7863180,7865020," I haven't been meaning to ignore you."
7865020,7867500," A lot asks, do you have a lot of memberships on YouTube?"
7867500,7868500," Understand if you can't answer."
7868500,7872820," We actually have about 600 YouTube members and the only benefit that we've really offered"
7872820,7876020," to them is other than thanks for supporting the channel."
7876020,7881060," So like shout out, like thank you so much guys is merch discounts that I actually talked"
7881060,7882060," to Nick about recently."
7882060,7883780," I just don't think are very good."
7883780,7887100," So we're going to work on what we can do for-"
7887100,7888380," We should make sure that-"
7888380,7889780," Parity, yes."
7889780,7894980," For both float plane, $10 tier and YouTube members, which are going to be the equivalent"
7894980,7895980," tiers."
7895980,7899620," Yeah, because YouTube members won't have a reduced cost tier."
7899620,7902740," They won't have like a $5 tier or anything like that."
7902740,7905340," Or the OG $3 tier, nothing like that."
7905340,7911020," So one of the things that we're going to do is make sure that if we do some kind of discount"
7911020,7916380," program, then that will actually make sense."
7916380,7920260," Or whether it's exclusive merch or whatever else the case may be."
7920260,7924900," The thing with exclusive merch guys is it's like a lot of work to make something good."
7924900,7929180," If all we were doing was just putting a logo on a mug or whatever, then yeah sure fine."
7929180,7932700," We'll do an exclusive one of float plane logo, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
7932700,7939220," But as it is, if we put a ton of work into it, it's kind of painful to not do a broad"
7939220,7940220," release of something."
7940220,7941220," Yeah."
7941220,7946940," Like I'd love to do a float plane exclusive like super cool like bomber jacket, you know,"
7946940,7947940," or whatever."
7947940,7951340," Like, oh, we are not doing that because we'd lose so much money."
7951340,7953060," It would make no sense."
7953060,7954060," Yep."
7954060,7962060," Okay, let me just see if there's any other stuff here."
7962060,7963820," Does Apple pay break merch messages?"
7963820,7964940," Someone says mine didn't go through."
7964940,7966380," It's possible we just haven't gotten to it yet."
7966380,7969580," Poor Dan is his fingers around fire trying to reply to them."
7969580,7972060," We actually need to talk about merch messages too guys."
7972060,7977500," Merch messages are part of the reason that the show has been drawn out to untenable lengths."
7977500,7979100," It's not that we don't want to talk to you guys."
7979100,7983580," It's just that we feel kind of obligated, especially when you give us such great discussion"
7983580,7988460," topics or you ask us, you know, really cool and important questions, we feel really obligated"
7988460,7994060," to address them and not just, hey, cool merch message, but like address them in a meaningful"
7994060,7995980," manner."
7995980,8000940," But there's a lot of cases where Luke and I can't address every good merch message anymore."
8000940,8003020," It's just gotten unmanageable."
8003020,8005180," And Dan often doesn't know the question."
8005180,8009300," So we've been talking internally about what a workflow would look like where Dan has an"
8009300,8011740," additional stream that he can send things through."
8011740,8016540," Right now he can just push it out to the lower third."
8016540,8019500," So it's just like, hi mom or whatever else it just goes."
8019500,8021420," Yeah, Joshua H didn't leave a message."
8021420,8024740," It's just like Joshua H bought an RGB diode t-shirt."
8024740,8025740," Cool."
8025740,8027820," For 20 bucks."
8027820,8031180," Then the next one is Dan can reply via text."
8031180,8034580," So you'll see someone's question, kind of like that."
8034580,8038180," And then there'll be a follow up one that has an answer of some sort."
8038180,8039180," Let's see what Dan said."
8039180,8042140," Can't wait for LTX driving up from Oregon State University."
8042140,8045180," Do you plan on discontinuing the goals to create a Spanish Q's kit?"
8045180,8046180," That's not accurate."
8046180,8048500," I don't think I said that."
8048500,8050140," Oh, well who replied to that?"
8050140,8051140," I don't know."
8051140,8052140," Was it you?"
8052140,8053140," It wasn't me."
8053140,8055420," No, it could be someone else in the dashboard."
8055420,8059460," As not as in like an intruder, but it could be somebody else in the dashboard."
8059460,8062900," I've been doing something a little bit different this week is I've been leaving a lot of them"
8062900,8067060," for you guys to maybe respond to via text."
8067060,8073500," Because yeah, I haven't been able to give like a reasonable response to a lot of them."
8073500,8076740," So who wrote sunglasses for things confiscated by TSA?"
8076740,8078700," I didn't respond to that one."
8078700,8079700," I didn't."
8079700,8082580," Somebody else is in here responding to the user."
8082580,8084300," Who is replying to merch messages right now?"
8084300,8086300," It's probably Conrad."
8086300,8087300," I would assume so."
8087300,8090780," Because I have 85 in the queue right now."
8090780,8094500," And I've been going through and removing the ones that are kind of maybe not question-related."
8094500,8096900," But a lot of these I think you guys could respond to."
8096900,8102500," So the second path is a text response kind of like what we're showing you."
8102500,8107180," And the third path is that it goes into a queue for me and Luke to discuss."
8107180,8112860," What I think we should do is create a fourth path that will essentially create a customer"
8112860,8117740," support ticket and we will get back to people next week."
8117740,8121020," We already have a customer support team that's like half a dozen people at this point."
8121020,8122940," They're not always crazy busy."
8122940,8126980," So is there any reason why if your message is something like, you know, hey, when are"
8126980,8129780," you guys going to do a float plan exclusive t-shirt or whatever?"
8129780,8133660," There's no real reason for that to not go to the customer support team where they can"
8133660,8138300," do something meaningful with it, like compile the most common requests for new items or"
8138300,8142940," whatever else and then relay that to the appropriate people here in the organization."
8142940,8147060," Because even for me, I can't answer every question that you guys ask."
8147060,8149380," Are there plans for an LTD wrist rest?"
8149380,8151020," I'm using the indoor hoodie."
8151020,8155180," Wait, as a wrist rest?"
8155180,8156180," That's interesting."
8156180,8157180," Okay."
8157180,8158180," Okay."
8158180,8160340," So that is an answer that is correct."
8160340,8163380," We do not have plans for a wrist rest, but I don't know who's replying and I don't know"
8163380,8165860," how they know that or if they know that for sure."
8165860,8168260," The spaghetti made of meat was me."
8168260,8169260," Okay."
8169260,8170260," From the previous one."
8170260,8171260," Interesting."
8171260,8175100," I saw one about what's the weirdest thing you had confiscated by TSA."
8175100,8176940," I remember leaving that one."
8176940,8181260," My little tiny, my little tiny konifa."
8181260,8182260," Hold on."
8182260,8183260," It was Conrad."
8183260,8185700," He's very good natured."
8185700,8189540," He can see that there is a massive queue and is just trying to help."
8189540,8190540," I see."
8190540,8191540," Okay."
8191540,8194700," If Conrad is a hundred percent confident and- I have already messaged that."
8194700,8196060," Okay."
8196060,8200420," Please sign it so that we're not sitting here going mystery who is replying to him."
8200420,8202820," Do you like a dash with your initials?"
8202820,8205460," Ones that aren't initialed are tanned."
8205460,8206460," And then everything else."
8206460,8209060," When I respond to them, I do LL at the end."
8209060,8210060," Yeah."
8210060,8211060," I put my initials down."
8211060,8213580," I had one of these confiscated actually not that long ago."
8213580,8215140," That makes sense, but is unfortunate."
8215140,8216140," Yeah."
8216140,8220300," It's like no more dangerous than a sharp car key realistically."
8220300,8221300," Yeah."
8221300,8223940," You could, you could, knives are scary."
8223940,8224940," Oh yeah."
8224940,8229060," You could hurt someone very badly with this knife."
8229060,8230740," That's also clearly a tool."
8230740,8236180," But that's also true of like a sharpened car key or a massive variety of other things."
8236180,8237180," Yeah."
8237180,8238180," Yeah."
8238180,8240020," So I was pretty bummed because it's a spider coat."
8240020,8244180," It's like, it's not a lot of metal, but it's for how small it is."
8244180,8246580," It's not that cheap."
8246580,8252300," And I'm really dumb because the last time I lost it, I actually had Vance order me a"
8252300,8255820," new one because I was just like, oh, I mean, this seems like the kind of thing that an"
8255820,8257540," assistant might do."
8257540,8258540," I lost my knife."
8258540,8260100," Can you please get me a new one?"
8260100,8262500," I gave him the wrong bottle name."
8262500,8264020," So I bought two knives."
8264020,8267700," I bought a ladybug and a bug."
8267700,8268700," Derp."
8268700,8270940," Oh man."
8270940,8272660," I don't blame Vance at all."
8272660,8274220," I didn't show him the one I lost."
8274220,8278020," I just asked for a ladybug and I don't have a ladybug."
8278020,8280220," I have a bug."
8280220,8282580," Cool."
8282580,8287380," Does anyone, does anyone object to that whole turning on YouTube memberships thing?"
8287380,8292900," I was watching Flowplane Chat, I think for the most part, people get it."
8292900,8299180," The one thing that did came up, come up, was just basically making sure there was at a"
8299180,8300660," very minimum parity."
8300660,8303140," So YouTube shouldn't get something that--"
8303140,8304660," Flowplane will be better."
8304660,8305660," It's not going to be trade-offs."
8305660,8308140," We're going to be very upfront that Flowplane is better."
8308140,8312060," And if you want the best possible engagement with Linus Media Group and everything that"
8312060,8314500," we do, that's on Flowplane."
8314500,8318860," Because there's certain things that we're just not going to be able to carry it on YouTube."
8318860,8321860," The community on Flowplane is just super cool."
8321860,8322860," Really love it."
8322860,8323860," Yeah."
8323860,8324860," Oh, they want a pull."
8324860,8325860," That makes sense."
8325860,8326860," Yeah, we should just--"
8326860,8328180," Pulls have been acting a little weird, but I will throw it up."
8328180,8329180," We'll see how it goes."
8329180,8330180," We'll give it a shot."
8330180,8331180," All right, guys."
8331180,8337220," But overall, it seems like the perception is pretty good."
8337220,8338820," You think, are you cool with the YouTube thing?"
8338820,8339820," Is fair enough?"
8339820,8340820," Oh, people are asking."
8340820,8341820," What about shorts?"
8341820,8347820," We are looking at-- I actually talked to the social team about this recently."
8347820,8354820," What we're trying to do is use text and picture posts to put-- I don't think we're going"
8354820,8359780," to do this until we've got the channels thing fully launched, not beta anymore."
8359780,8364420," But once we do, I think we're going to add a social channel and maybe a shorts channel."
8364420,8367220," And then you can subscribe to those ones for notifications if you want."
8367220,8370060," But otherwise, we're going to turn off-- can we turn off notifications by default?"
8370060,8376740," So I don't know if we can do it for specific levels, but probably."
8376740,8379140," Not for specific levels, just for specific channels."
8379140,8380140," No, that's OK."
8380140,8381140," So that's what I meant."
8381140,8382140," Oh, I see."
8382140,8383140," OK."
8383140,8384940," Well, people can always turn off the notifications."
8384940,8385940," That's going to be a lot."
8385940,8386940," It will be too much."
8386940,8387940," Yeah, like if every stupid--"
8387940,8391540," So this is why we haven't done it yet, is basically on the beta site for Flowplane right"
8391540,8394580," now, there's this new sub-channels feature."
8394580,8397420," So there's like minus media group, which still needs to be renamed."
8397420,8398940," So it's just line of textips right now."
8398940,8403780," And then all of the YouTube channels, we want to add a section for WAN."
8403780,8406900," We want to add a section for shorts, all these other types of things."
8406900,8411860," But if we start adding in all of the shorts and social posts, your phone is just never"
8411860,8412860," going to stop."
8412860,8416220," There are multiple people at the company that it is their whole job to effectively make"
8416220,8419260," it so that in this scenario, your phone would never stop."
8419260,8420260," Yeah, that's true."
8420260,8424300," So like, we don't actually necessarily want that to happen unless you're just like, yeah,"
8424300,8425300," give me everything."
8425300,8426660," So that'll be an option."
8426660,8427660," Yeah."
8427660,8428980," You need to not do that to people."
8428980,8432180," You need to be able to turn off notifications for channels that you might not be interested"
8432180,8433180," in."
8433180,8437260," Maybe you're just interested in like MAC address and tech news."
8437260,8440820," Well, you should be able to just turn those on and turn everything else off."
8440820,8443860," Or maybe you're interested in the opposite of that, then you should be able to turn those"
8443860,8446460," ones off and everything else on, et cetera, et cetera."
8446460,8447460," The poll's coming."
8447460,8451820," Michael W, you should check out Open Sense, OPN Sense."
8451820,8454340," And also do that."
8454340,8457780," It's a fork of PF Sense that gets updated more frequently."
8457780,8458780," All right."
8458780,8461140," Want to hit a stand?"
8461140,8463860," Oh, wait, we're supposed to do more topics?"
8463860,8464860," Are there more topics?"
8464860,8466020," Have you run out of topics?"
8466020,8467020," I don't know."
8467020,8470660," There's New York, New Safety Standards for Lithium Batteries after some fires."
8470660,8472820," That seems like pretty good."
8472820,8478140," Ebikes, scooters, lithium ion batteries have to have third party certification for UL fire"
8478140,8479140," safety standards."
8479140,8480580," Oh, that kind of makes sense."
8480580,8484460," You can't just have these like random certifying themselves."
8484460,8485460," Cool."
8485460,8488780," You still have 15 minutes before I'm going to turn out the lights on you."
8488780,8489780," So, okay."
8489780,8493900," Why don't we talk about Tesla employees sharing private recordings of users and bystanders,"
8493900,8496900," including children?"
8496900,8502180," We touched on this before, but Tesla is now facing a class action suit following an allegation"
8502180,8506460," by multiple former employees that it was common practice for Tesla employees to internally"
8506460,8511060," share sensitive videos and images of customers, often for the purpose of mockery."
8511060,8514580," Some made memes out of the images and shared them through the internal messaging system."
8514580,8519260," And sometimes the sharing was between individuals, other times between small groups."
8519260,8524420," But at times, the groups contained scores of employees."
8524420,8530340," Shared images included car accidents, embarrassing personal moments, nudity, and customer pets"
8530340,8531340," and children."
8531340,8532340," Oh, yeah."
8532340,8534140," Because like there's internal cameras, right?"
8534140,8536340," People do things in cars."
8536340,8538820," I mean, I never have."
8538820,8547500," But and I've definitely never been talked to by the police about it."
8547500,8555820," So yeah, if you if you had one, you had one of these, there could be a video of that,"
8555820,8556980," you know, yeah."
8556980,8559860," And maybe someone's like, Oh, I recognize this guy and shares it internally."
8559860,8561100," Like you don't want that to happen."
8561100,8562860," Flippen exclusive."
8562860,8567460," One particularly popular 2021 video showed a driver hitting a child on a bike at significant"
8567460,8570700," speed, hard enough to child went flying."
8570700,8575860," Another showed a person being dragged into a car apparently against their will."
8575860,8579940," According to Tesla, its recordings are anonymous and not linked to the user of their vehicle."
8579940,8583580," However, several former employees claim that the recordings are linked to location data,"
8583580,8587100," which could reveal where a user lives, obviously."
8587100,8591180," It's unclear how widespread it was, but it's well known enough that several managers pushed"
8591180,8595140," back on image sharing on general communication challenges as a violation of the company privacy"
8595140,8596260," policy."
8596260,8599540," In some offices, these memes were seen as a way of earning social approval that might"
8599540,8603900," lead to promotion as people in leadership roles were apparently particularly prolific"
8603900,8605620," at sharing these images."
8605620,8611380," Well, I don't I can't think of anyone in Tesla leadership who's like a meaner and doesn't"
8611380,8615220," have a lot of regard for, you know, right?"
8615220,8616220," Yeah."
8616220,8617220," Yep."
8617220,8618220," Yep."
8618220,8619220," Well, yeah, that doesn't really check out."
8619220,8624020," Yeah, because like there is there is a certain amount of like there's there's things that"
8624020,8625140," can be pretty hard to detect."
8625140,8634300," If you're a company that deals with like customer data, if two employees in direct messages"
8634300,8640860," that you can't monitor are memeing about it, it might be pretty hard to detect genuinely."
8640860,8643780," But like this doesn't sound like that."
8643780,8646060," It sounds very widespread."
8646060,8649820," All employees reported feeling paranoid while driving the company cars knowing how much"
8649820,8654980," information was available on the other end and how it could be used."
8654980,8655980," Wow."
8655980,8660380," Discussion question, how does this kind of culture grow within a company?"
8660380,8661380," I don't know."
8661380,8668140," How do I put this in a way that is empathetic but also based in reality?"
8668140,8671260," People are jerkwads."
8671260,8674540," Not all of them, but enough of them."
8674540,8683500," And on imity and or a perception that your actions are free from consequences definitely"
8683500,8686100," breeds a certain kind of behavior in people."
8686100,8691420," There's also a pretty intense amount of like if they were on the other end of this, they"
8691420,8693900," might feel really negative about it."
8693900,8695180," But like, I'm doing it."
8695180,8697660," So like, I am good."
8697660,8701260," Most people believe themselves as good aligned."
8701260,8703060," So like, this is fine."
8703060,8704140," I'm just making a joke."
8704140,8707260," This isn't actually harming anyone, whatever, right?"
8707260,8708260," They don't know."
8708260,8709260," It can't hurt them."
8709260,8711260," That type of stuff."
8711260,8712260," Yeah."
8712260,8713260," New topic."
8713260,8715420," I'm kind of done with it, to be honest."
8715420,8716420," Not very cool."
8716420,8718740," Yeah, agreed."
8718740,8720500," Intel teams up with ARM."
8720500,8726980," Intel and ARM have announced a multi-generation agreement to optimize Intel's 18A fabrication"
8726980,8729660," process for ARM-based chip designs."
8729660,8733540," While Foundry services would not necessarily be producing chips directly for ARM, but they"
8733540,8737460," would be in a position to more effectively fulfill orders from ARM licensees like Qualcomm"
8737460,8739220," and MediaTech."
8739220,8743060," Intel described the collaboration as a way of enabling a more balanced global supply"
8743060,8747780," chain for Foundry customers working in mobile SOC design on ARM-based CPU cores, which is"
8747780,8753980," another way of saying that if China actually really does it this time and invades Taiwan,"
8753980,8759300," you guys are going to need some way to produce chips because I don't think China is going"
8759300,8764740," to be super cool about shipping chips to the west after the couple of years that they've"
8764740,8766220," had over there."
8766220,8772060," Intel has described plans to produce hybrid chips that combine x86 ARM and RISC-V CPU cores"
8772060,8773420," in the past."
8773420,8776700," We don't know if this is necessarily related to that, but that could be kind of cool."
8776700,8780700," And at the same time, Intel has announced that they are selling off their server division"
8780700,8785060," to MyTech, me tech, sorry, exiting the server system business."
8785060,8788220," I actually didn't know they still did first party servers."
8788220,8792180," And it doesn't surprise me that they're bailing because it's a relatively low margin business."
8792180,8799380," I mean, most of the money in that server made by Super Micro or Dell or whatever is going"
8799380,8806540," to three places, Intel, Nvidia, or software."
8806540,8807540," Yeah."
8807540,8809580," I have the same reaction when I read this."
8809580,8815860," And I think some people misinterpreted this as like Intel is exiting the server space entirely,"
8815860,8819300," not them like making their own servers, because I think people didn't even realize that they"
8819300,8821020," did that."
8821020,8822620," So they misinterpreted the title."
8822620,8824580," Because when I read it, I was like, wait, what?"
8824580,8826900," Because yeah, I didn't think they did that either."
8826900,8832220," That nerd owes in a hot minute."
8832220,8833220," And that's it, Dan."
8833220,8836780," I think it's time for Wanshow After Dark."
8836780,8838020," Except he has to go over there to do it."
8838020,8839380," So it's not going to be that Puy."
8839380,8840380," Oh."
8840380,8842740," He's going to automate it though."
8842740,8843740," Oh my goodness."
8843740,8845740," We could totally see you walking across."
8845740,8849620," You've become immersed in the LMG way."
8849620,8855340," I think Dan, when he started, would have insisted on not walking in front of the camera."
8855340,8856900," I was so retented with that."
8856900,8857900," In another six months."
8857900,8858900," Yeah, exactly."
8858900,8860860," Okay, it didn't take six months."
8860860,8863940," That's how it's going to be."
8863940,8866540," All right, hit us."
8866540,8870340," Let me sit down first, man."
8870340,8871820," Okay."
8871820,8873180," This is from Jesse."
8873180,8874180," Hey, Luke."
8874180,8875700," Terrifying to think."
8875700,8881340," We are living through a progress in AI that will form the foundation of our future utopia"
8881340,8882340," or annihilation."
8882340,8886420," How did I know the whole content of the statement when it started with terrifying?"
8886420,8887420," Yes."
8887420,8892100," Any idea how you would explain AR to children or young teens?"
8892100,8893100," Oh."
8893100,8895980," It's a different direction than I was expecting to."
8895980,8903420," The way I've done that so far is to just describe it as a computer assistant."
8903420,8907300," An advanced computer assistant that you can control by talking to it."
8907300,8912020," And honestly, they tend to get it pretty fast."
8912020,8916380," I think this is again one of those things where like we're the old people now."
8916380,8921420," So we're probably adjusting to it worse than the kids are."
8921420,8925340," I've talked to some startup teams about it."
8925340,8927820," I've seen this idea pushed around by other people as well."
8927820,8929900," I don't know if I said it first or not."
8929900,8937580," I can't say if I stole it, but looking at how the youngens use these tools is probably"
8937580,8940980," going to be a very interesting thing to do."
8940980,8946580," Because a lot of us, like a lot of what I'm getting out of it is like I'm excited for"
8946580,8948340," co-pilot to come to office."
8948340,8949660," That announcement was insane."
8949660,8950660," That blew my mind."
8950660,8955620," When co-pilot comes to office, I'm going to immediately be getting different teams around"
8955620,8960460," this office to start using it for beneficial things."
8960460,8963980," There's a lot of different ways that people could be more efficient with co-pilot directly"
8963980,8967500," built into office."
8967500,8972140," That's how old boomer me is interpreting it."
8972140,8975140," But how are the kids going to use it?"
8975140,8976140," That's an interesting question."
8976140,8976980," But yeah, I don't know."
8976980,8984060," I haven't had any young people, and I've talked to a couple of people that are younger than"
8984060,8985060," 14."
8985060,8987580," How old they are about it."
8987580,8988940," They tend to get that pretty quick."
8988940,8992500," It doesn't seem super complicated to them, which I find interesting."
8992500,8994140," But yeah, that's it."
8994140,8996940," Yeah, it's going to get scary."
8996940,9000740," Hey Linus, which one of your cats would you say is your absolute favorite?"
9000740,9001740," Oof."
9001740,9002740," Oof."
9002740,9004620," It's got to be my dashy."
9004620,9005620," Yeah, dash."
9005620,9011700," She's the one we've had the longest."
9011700,9017660," She's the one that likes me the most or is bonded to me the most."
9017660,9022340," People who think cats don't have relationships with people, they just see them as a food source."
9022340,9029620," Have just obviously never had a cat or never cared for a cat because they expect reciprocation."
9029620,9032980," Their love is not unconditional."
9032980,9040540," So the way that she'll follow me around and want snuggles and want to hang out is really"
9040540,9041540," sweet."
9041540,9043940," She doesn't always want to be held or anything like that."
9043940,9047300," But she is almost always orbiting the family."
9047300,9049660," If everyone's upstairs, dash is upstairs."
9049660,9053380," If everyone's in the basement, she might be chilling over there on a chair."
9053380,9054940," But she likes to be near everybody."
9054940,9056820," She's super social."
9056820,9059060," And she's just such a sweetheart."
9059060,9065260," There's more than one of the contractors who worked on our renovation over the last couple"
9065260,9073220," of years, more than one of them messaged me just pictures of Dash completely unsolicited,"
9073220,9077060," just being hilarious or being a sweetheart."
9077060,9082500," And more than one Linus Media Group employee who was at my house for some reason or another,"
9082500,9086460," unsolicited messaged me a picture of Dash just being a sweetheart or being hilarious."
9086460,9088420," She's just a great cat."
9088420,9092500," Okay, this one might be for Luke as well."
9092500,9093780," It's from Chris."
9093780,9097420," Luke and Linus with companies now getting their own LLMs."
9097420,9100180," It's hard to say."
9100180,9105660," What are your thoughts on companies or governments being able to create an actually effective"
9105660,9112700," AI powered lie detector?"
9112700,9113700," I don't..."
9113700,9114700," What do you mean?"
9114700,9126420," Yeah, I don't know if any test can be defeated by a suitably armed test taker."
9126420,9128180," Also, I don't know if I just..."
9128180,9129660," I just don't know if I buy that."
9129660,9133940," Using a thing that notoriously lies all the time as a lie detector is kind of hilarious"
9133940,9134940," in my opinion."
9134940,9137340," Yeah, I think we can move on to the next one."
9137340,9138340," Easy."
9138340,9140340," This is from Aaron."
9140340,9147820," Recently purchased a Gigabyte 4080 ARO OC, the HDMI 2.1 connection is last in priority,"
9147820,9152300," making a multi-monitor setup impossible to show bias on the HDMI."
9152300,9157380," If a DisplayPort is connected, why?"
9157380,9159180," This is a rough one."
9159180,9160620," I can answer your question."
9160620,9169940," It's because DisplayPort 99 times out of 100 is going to be the primary display for a GPU."
9169940,9172900," Unless you are only connected via HDMI."
9172900,9176300," So that's why that's the default behavior."
9176300,9183060," As for why multi-monitor management isn't better in this day and age, I don't rightly"
9183060,9184300," know."
9184300,9189100," Obviously, this is a pretty niche use case, mine."
9189100,9192740," But I was furious recently."
9192740,9194500," Like just..."
9194500,9196220," It's just..."
9196220,9203140," Yeah, just furious recently because I was trying to do something that felt very simple."
9203140,9207900," What I wanted was to manually assign each of my displays."
9207900,9215380," So my computer sits in the mechanical room and it runs my desktop display upstairs."
9215380,9220500," It runs the system like another display over in the land room with my kids' machines."
9220500,9221500," Yeah."
9221500,9223060," We can play Minecraft Dungeons or whatever."
9223060,9227140," And I also wanted to play in the theater room."
9227140,9229460," And I have optical cables going everywhere."
9229460,9230820," It all works."
9230820,9232940," I can do that."
9232940,9237060," What I wanted was to manually assign the display priority."
9237060,9238060," So the number."
9238060,9240860," You know how in Windows, this is display one, this is two, this is three."
9240860,9242460," When you click identify, it shows the number of the three."
9242460,9243460," Yeah."
9243460,9249700," And there are certain things that..."
9249700,9250700," I forget."
9250700,9253300," I don't even remember exactly why it mattered."
9253300,9258540," But there are certain things that are easier to do if a particular display is display number"
9258540,9259540," one."
9259540,9260540," Interesting."
9260540,9261540," Not just primary, it has to be display one."
9261540,9262540," That's right."
9262540,9263540," Thought it was primary."
9263540,9264540," Interesting."
9264540,9265540," Yeah."
9265540,9269700," And when you set a display as your primary display, that doesn't make it display number"
9269700,9270700," one."
9270700,9271700," No, it definitely doesn't."
9271700,9275340," That just makes it your primary display for all intents and purposes."
9275340,9276620," So it was that..."
9276620,9280660," I think what I wanted to do was I wanted..."
9280660,9287060," To have it duplicated and then only go to one and then I wanted to be able to like..."
9287060,9292300," I wanted to make sure that that one upstairs was always the first one."
9292300,9294980," And the theater room was always the third one."
9294980,9296620," And there was some reason I wanted to do that."
9296620,9297620," I'm sorry."
9297620,9298620," I just don't..."
9298620,9299620," I don't remember anymore."
9299620,9302820," And what I discovered is that there are some weird hacky workarounds."
9302820,9308860," If you do a fresh install and you plug in the first one first, that like should make it"
9308860,9309860," the first one."
9309860,9313700," There are also registry keys that maybe you can whatever."
9313700,9316980," Some people have had some success with moving the displays around on different ports, but"
9316980,9319580," most people reported that didn't work."
9319580,9324980," But there is no hard and fast way for you to just tell windows actually f*** off."
9324980,9326540," This is display one."
9326540,9329340," This is my primary display."
9329340,9330660," And this has been a problem."
9330660,9334460," I remember at NCIX, I had four monitors."
9334460,9340900," And what I did at that time is I got frustrated at some point and I just physically moved"
9340900,9342180," them."
9342180,9347180," Because every time a display driver reset happened or whatever, I didn't want them mixed"
9347180,9348180," up."
9348180,9349180," I didn't want to deal with that."
9349180,9351020," I just wanted them to be detected correctly."
9351020,9353900," You cannot do that."
9353900,9356300," That's pretty frustrating."
9356300,9358740," It is infuriating it."
9358740,9363420," Obviously there's people helpfully reply to users saying, \"Well, Linux, you can do this.\""
9363420,9366020," That's nice, but I'm not running Linux."
9366020,9367020," Thank you."
9367020,9368020," Yeah."
9368020,9374460," So, if anyone from Microsoft is watching, please?"
9374460,9379660," Please just let me assign my display priority."
9379660,9381180," That would be great."
9381180,9382180," Thank you."
9382180,9384900," I really wish I remembered why it was so infuriating."
9384900,9387580," I was trying to do something."
9387580,9389940," I wanted all three of them running."
9389940,9393460," And then when one would kick in, it would boot off the other one."
9393460,9395260," I can't remember anymore."
9395260,9396260," Sorry."
9396260,9397260," Okay, Dan."
9397260,9399020," Okay, this is from Ian."
9399020,9403540," \"Linus, with AI having the ability to be trained on anything, do you believe at some"
9403540,9410740," point we will see an AI antivirus or the need for an anti-AI virus to stop AI actions?"
9410740,9414420," AI versus anti-AI AI?\""
9414420,9416220," Totally already a thing."
9416220,9423740," Yeah, like machine learning enabled, anti-malware will look for certain patterns of behavior in"
9423740,9427900," programs and it will flag them even if they aren't a known threat."
9427900,9428900," Yep."
9428900,9431340," Okay, got another one here."
9431340,9434180," The year is 2073."
9434180,9438580," Grandpa Linus steps in front of the camera one last time to record his final Linus Tech"
9438580,9441740," Tips video before finally retiring."
9441740,9443660," What would said video be about?"
9443660,9445420," You retired pretty old."
9445420,9447740," Yeah, wow, I made it really far."
9447740,9454620," I know I'm pretty sure that this job would kill me long before then."
9454620,9458820," I think it would just be a big thank you to everyone."
9458820,9464860," Man, okay, if it has to be about an actual product."
9464860,9473580," I'd love for it to be some kind of grand project, a whole room water cooling or a scrapyard"
9473580,9478260," wars, but I think more realistically it would probably be a troll."
9478260,9482260," Like it'd probably be a fake review of a product that's not real, but we did some movie"
9482260,9485340," magic and made it seem real or something."
9485340,9489940," I could see going out with a mystery."
9489940,9491420," How did he have that?"
9491420,9493260," How did he get that working?"
9493260,9497860," Yeah, I could see just being a complete mememer about it."
9497860,9500060," But I still have a sense of humor when I'm that old."
9500060,9501060," I hope so."
9501060,9505460," I think it'll still be a troll."
9505460,9507380," Just improves with age."
9507380,9510140," Okay, next up's from Mason."
9510140,9514980," Hello, Dan and the talent."
9514980,9515980," Thank you."
9515980,9516980," I feel so vindicated."
9516980,9517980," What about Luke?"
9517980,9518980," Wow."
9518980,9519980," Got him."
9519980,9520980," Good one."
9520980,9521980," Yeah."
9521980,9522980," I collect CRTs."
9522980,9527980," I have 12 now and cannot explain how I justify keeping all of them."
9527980,9534980," Is there any now antiquated technology that you don't think you could ever get rid of?"
9534980,9541100," Man, these are like really tough questions."
9541100,9543020," Antiquated technology."
9543020,9544580," I don't think I could get rid of."
9544580,9547140," I mean, a phone, a phone."
9547140,9551020," Watch seems pretty superfluous these days, but I just, I don't know, I kind of just like"
9551020,9552020," wearing them."
9552020,9553740," This doesn't even have the right time on it."
9553740,9557100," This is that pebble that, the pebble time that Shank mods gave me."
9557100,9560500," I'm wearing it so that I remember to figure out Rebel."
9560500,9565340," It's like this weird side load old pebble apps, something thing."
9565340,9567260," Apparently you could like still get these things working."
9567260,9568740," I just haven't gotten around to it."
9568740,9572300," I dedicated about three minutes to it and was like, okay, this is more than a three-minute"
9572300,9573300," project."
9573300,9574300," And then I gave up temporarily."
9574300,9577660," So this is to like remind me to do it."
9577660,9580540," Antiquated tech that you can't bring yourself to get rid of."
9580540,9581540," I mean, Luke doesn't buy anything."
9581540,9583140," So he doesn't have anything."
9583140,9584940," There's some retro console stuff."
9584940,9585940," Yeah."
9585940,9588980," Okay, I'd have a hard time getting rid of."
9588980,9590700," You could if you needed to though, just emulate."
9590700,9592500," But I absolutely could."
9592500,9593500," Yeah."
9593500,9595620," And have seriously thought about it and just don't have to right now, which is the only"
9595620,9597180," reason why I haven't."
9597180,9601660," But like if I needed money, I would flip my retro consoles immediately."
9601660,9603740," That'd be the first thing to go."
9603740,9605820," I don't know."
9605820,9607100," So yeah, not really."
9607100,9609780," I don't know."
9609780,9615900," Next up, when show with guests as the olden days, when guests take a long run, when"
9615900,9618740," they take a long time, I love bringing guests on."
9618740,9621180," But how do I say this tactfully?"
9621180,9625020," Generally speaking, the guest segments don't perform as well as when it's just me and Luke"
9625020,9628180," and I guess that guy."
9628180,9634580," So there's no audience drive to make that happen."
9634580,9639740," Speaking broadly, and it makes the show take even longer, which is already a problem we"
9639740,9641060," have."
9641060,9644900," So we're not solving any problems and we're creating new ones."
9644900,9648660," A good thing to have in the back pocket for when it like totally makes sense by either"
9648660,9655900," us very specifically wanting to add promotion to a thing or a person for a very specific"
9655900,9660100," reason or because like we need help with a topic."
9660100,9663940," If there's like, Hey, you did this thing, we want to talk to you about it."
9663940,9669540," Maybe but also maybe not because it might be better to just talk to you about it offline"
9669540,9671940," and then cover the notes."
9671940,9674980," Okay, got another one here."
9674980,9677860," Would you ever make a hand warmer for typing?"
9677860,9684540," My hands freeze in office in a small heated desk pad or infrared heater would be amazing."
9684540,9691100," Also any logistics tips for a prospective bad mint and gym owner."
9691100,9692100," Don't do it."
9692100,9693100," It's not a profitable business."
9693100,9695860," I'm only getting into it because I intend to lose money."
9695860,9699260," Oh, mind you real estate might not be as expensive where you are."
9699260,9700260," Okay."
9700260,9701260," Good luck."
9701260,9705540," In that case, here it's super dumb."
9705540,9710380," As for the hand warmer, that's the opposite direction that I'm used to hearing that go."
9710380,9713900," I'm used to people getting like little fans and stuff, not."
9713900,9715740," Yeah, you're a warm boy though."
9715740,9719740," Like I guarantee you, Yvonne would benefit from like a desktop hand warmer."
9719740,9723580," I'd be afraid to ship anything that's designed to generate heat."
9723580,9724580," Yeah."
9724580,9727180," I'd just be worried about liability and like melting stuff."
9727180,9728180," Yeah."
9728180,9730580," Like someone touching it and burning themselves."
9730580,9733780," The general move is to put a cage in front of it that limits."
9733780,9736900," Yeah, but now this is becoming very cumbersome."
9736900,9738780," So you've got a heating element wiring."
9738780,9740980," You've got a cage."
9740980,9741980," Hmm."
9741980,9743980," I don't know."
9743980,9744980," Okay."
9744980,9750980," I think you could do a wrist rest actually by using that same like wire that they use"
9750980,9752300," in heating blankets."
9752300,9753300," Yeah."
9753300,9758260," Yeah, the wrist rest could be doable."
9758260,9762940," There's definitely options."
9762940,9767980," You could do gloves as well, but like I hate wearing gloves when I'm typing or using a"
9767980,9768980," mouse."
9768980,9772780," Yeah, like gamer gloves were a thing for a very small period of time."
9772780,9776540," I think we even bought a bunch of gamer gloves with the intention of doing a roundup."
9776540,9778340," What the heck happened to that?"
9778340,9779340," Dang it."
9779340,9780340," I don't know."
9780340,9783340," But the number of videos that were like, oh yeah, we should totally do that."
9783340,9785540," We just never do wild."
9785540,9786540," Yeah."
9786540,9789260," One of the problems is like power delivery."
9789260,9793900," If it's gloves or something like that, that gets weird."
9793900,9798620," I mean, people wear giant helmets."
9798620,9802820," So like, yeah, you never know what nerds will wear."
9802820,9803820," What?"
9803820,9804820," Way giant."
9804820,9805820," You mean VR?"
9805820,9806820," Yeah."
9806820,9807820," Okay."
9807820,9808820," I was like, what is this?"
9808820,9809820," No, I mean, daff punk."
9809820,9810820," Oh man."
9810820,9811820," That's funny."
9811820,9812820," No promises."
9812820,9813820," Yeah."
9813820,9820820," What's the progress update on the stubby screwdriver is something different compared to the full-size"
9820820,9821820," screwdriver in development."
9821820,9825260," I would really love to hear more about it since we saw it last."
9825260,9829260," It's just small and it's still mostly on track."
9829260,9832220," It looks like for LTX launch."
9832220,9833220," Exciting."
9833220,9834220," I'm excited."
9834220,9839660," Two Linus and Luke, but mostly Luke, another AI question."
9839660,9841660," What are your thoughts on the AI?"
9841660,9848460," What are your thoughts on JetGPT-4 being used for sports betting, stock trading, and crypto"
9848460,9850380," trading or prediction?"
9850380,9851380," Love the show."
9851380,9853220," Shout out from South Louisiana."
9853220,9855820," I think the A got cut off."
9855820,9856940," We all knew it was going to happen."
9856940,9859580," We kind of talked about it earlier in the show."
9859580,9860580," Use it at your own risk."
9860580,9861860," I don't know what to tell you."
9861860,9864820," I don't give financial advice."
9864820,9866580," Sounds scary though."
9866580,9871620," Using a language predictor to predict the results of a horse race."
9871620,9872620," Like really?"
9872620,9876860," I mean, the horses have names in language."
9876860,9877860," Yeah."
9877860,9879100," Okay, we can pick that up."
9879100,9886260," I think just deciding that it is a catch-all solution for all AI or ML tasks is a little"
9886260,9887260," weird."
9887260,9891100," But yeah, use at your own risk."
9891100,9893100," I don't know."
9893100,9896460," As a new subscriber, I have a question regarding floatplane."
9896460,9900060," Have the goals for the platform changed since the initial inception?"
9900060,9902460," What are the goals for floatplane currently?"
9902460,9904660," The core goal has never changed."
9904660,9907820," The core goal is based around the name."
9907820,9913620," The name floatplane was spawned from Nicklite."
9913620,9919700," It might not take off, but it will never sink kind of idea."
9919700,9927540," That core concept applies to how we do development and technological choices for the platform."
9927540,9929580," It makes things a lot harder."
9929580,9933860," It makes things a lot more complicated, to be honest, because there's much easier ways"
9933860,9935300," of doing things."
9935300,9941580," But when we build something, we always build it so that it can run on any platform, it"
9941580,9943060," can run with any service."
9943060,9949700," We might use some service for some specific thing, but I can guarantee you that that is"
9949700,9956300," portable to something else with little effort for everything that we do."
9956300,9961340," It would be easier because the industry is absolutely built for buy-in."
9961340,9964060," A lot of these big companies want you to…"
9964060,9965820," I don't remember what it's called."
9965820,9969300," Normally, I would be able to remember, but I don't remember right now."
9969300,9970500," There's a term for it."
9970500,9972660," Is it just lock-in?"
9972660,9977180," There's a term for it when you start working with one company, and then by working with"
9977180,9983540," them more and more and more and more, it would become extremely painful for you to switch"
9983540,9988060," to another company because all your stuff is built specifically for their platform."
9988060,9990340," CRMs are brutal for that."
9990340,9991340," Yeah."
9991340,9992340," Oh my god."
9992340,9993340," Yeah."
9993340,9994340," Tons of different things are brutal for that."
9994340,9995340," They want that."
9995340,9996340," Even if it's not sunk cost."
9996340,9997340," No, vendor lock."
9997340,9998540," Yeah, vendor lock."
9998540,10001740," Even if they advertise like, \"Oh, it's not like that.\""
10001740,10006940," Usually, the path of least resistance is to do that anyways."
10006940,10015820," We often go down the path of definitely not least resistance, which is rough, but I mean,"
10015820,10017740," we're still here."
10017740,10018740," We're still floating."
10018740,10019740," We're still okay."
10019740,10020740," Still kicking."
10020740,10023220," And that's kind of the main goal."
10023220,10027300," There's obviously other goals in regards to features and whatever else, but those are"
10027300,10032100," the things that we do to make the platform worth using for people, but the main goal is"
10032100,10034340," to make sure that the platform will always be here."
10034340,10035340," What's up?"
10035340,10036340," He's on it."
10036340,10037820," I'm doing it now."
10037820,10040740," We didn't announce the new product we launched on the store."
10040740,10042340," What have we launched?"
10042340,10044540," Oh, oh yeah."
10044540,10045540," New desk pad."
10045540,10046540," Hey."
10046540,10047540," Looks sick."
10047540,10048860," It does actually."
10048860,10050540," What the heck just happened?"
10050540,10051540," Oof."
10051540,10052540," Oof."
10052540,10053540," We're back."
10053540,10054540," New desk pad."
10054540,10055540," Oh, it's a design."
10055540,10056540," It's sick."
10056540,10060540," It's actually inspired by the sign in the lounge."
10060540,10061540," Oh, yeah."
10061540,10062540," That makes sense."
10062540,10063540," Yeah."
10063540,10066140," So it's kind of a Janice design if you really think about it."
10066140,10067140," Yeah."
10067140,10073540," I think that the one who actually brought it to life here was Lloyd, and there might have"
10073540,10081980," been some collaboration from Sarah or another designer because it started on a wall and"
10081980,10087220," had to make its way into A, a design for a mouse pad and B, a whole bunch of different"
10087220,10095460," sizes because this is yet another one of our 29.99, no matter what size you choose."
10095460,10096460," So products."
10096460,10098460," The amount of skis."
10098460,10104780," But yeah, it's a it's a it's a less stealthy, but still pretty darn stealthy design."
10104780,10106460," We did brand this one."
10106460,10111780," So it has a big fat LTT in the middle for your convenience right where your keyboard"
10111780,10112780," will be."
10112780,10116580," We wanted the keyboard to feel like the center of this design."
10116580,10122860," So you can see that even though the logo is dead center, the way that the line work comes"
10122860,10123860," in."
10123860,10125580," That's actually pretty cool."
10125580,10133140," It really works well with the keyboard being the kind of origin of all of the traces here"
10133140,10134140," in the second."
10134140,10135140," Yeah, that's smart."
10135140,10136140," Yeah."
10136140,10141160," So it's a it's a super it's the little thoughtful stuff like that that does happen."
10141160,10145940," These conversations do take place as part of the product development process, but it's"
10145940,10152380," not often easy to communicate to the to you to you all."
10152380,10159260," Yeah, same great three and a half millimeter base, same great anti-fray stitching around"
10159260,10163300," the edge, same great top surface weave."
10163300,10173540," I know you guys will love it because our desk pad has been a modest success to say the least."
10173540,10174540," Like what?"
10174540,10176260," That's a lot of reviews."
10176260,10177820," That is five stars."
10177820,10179100," These are not curated."
10179100,10180420," These are not filtered."
10180420,10185060," These are just people flipping love this thing."
10185060,10190780," I pretty much promise you that most of this stuff is just people who like never got their"
10190780,10196900," order shipping and and yeah and message support and we took a long time to get back to them"
10196900,10200580," and then they just like never updated their review, but we do get back to everyone."
10200580,10203900," It just does take some time sometimes and there's nothing we can do about that stuff."
10203900,10205260," We don't remove it."
10205260,10206260," We leave it there."
10206260,10208380," That's our that's that's on us."
10208380,10209380," We got it."
10209380,10212980," We got to do better, but you know, we can't prevent couriers from taking a long time."
10212980,10214500," Sometimes shipments get lost."
10214500,10215740," Stuff happens."
10215740,10219140," What we can do is reply to people in a timely manner and I've seen really good feedback"
10219140,10221060," about our customer service lately."
10221060,10226380," In fact, we managed to blow up on the subreddit for doing something good for a change, which"
10226380,10228420," was really nice recently."
10228420,10232420," We reached out proactively about the thing with the tech sack where the image on the"
10232420,10235340," site didn't match what people actually got."
10235340,10238580," So what we decided to do, even though it's like it's a functionally equivalent product"
10238580,10244900," and it's like better actually, we offered everyone a $10 credit for, you know, just"
10244900,10249500," being chill or if they didn't like that, then we offered just a full refund and return."
10249500,10250620," Like we'll able take it back."
10250620,10251620," No problem."
10251620,10253740," So people were people were pretty happy with that."
10253740,10254740," Cool."
10254740,10258020," It's the kind of thing that we would do even if we didn't have to because we don't have"
10258020,10262380," to, but we do it anyway because, you know, trust me, bro."
10262380,10263380," Got you."
10263380,10266060," Walk the message."
10266060,10268060," Hit me."
10268060,10269060," Okay."
10269060,10270820," Hey, LLD."
10270820,10274300," Most companies focus around how to automate tasks."
10274300,10279860," Are there functions in worker lifestyle that you all will purposely take the harder or"
10279860,10284580," more expensive route to preserve human skill and jobs?"
10284580,10289460," Uh oh, I was typing response and didn't hear the whole thing."
10289460,10293900," With automation becoming, most people would prioritize automation."
10293900,10299940," Are there areas where you would do it the hard way on purpose in order to preserve human"
10299940,10301820," skill and jobs?"
10301820,10303180," I think there's a lot of examples."
10303180,10304180," Oh, and jobs?"
10304180,10305180," I don't know."
10305180,10309560," There's a lot of examples of areas where people do it the hard way on purpose because"
10309560,10314580," people value the effort and skill and craftsmanship involved."
10314580,10316260," I don't think the art was the point."
10316260,10318620," I think productivity was the point here."
10318620,10321660," And if that's the case, honestly, for me, not really."
10321660,10324820," I don't think that's true for almost anyone."
10324820,10326700," That's not how people work."
10326700,10331900," Well, that's how, like as a society, we kind of create our rules though."
10331900,10336340," Like the number of times that we will, that we'll, we'll regulate something in order to"
10336340,10339380," preserve jobs."
10339380,10341620," It's wild to me."
10341620,10346780," Like imagine, imagine if we, uh, okay, uh, hold on."
10346780,10347780," Okay."
10347780,10348780," Here's an example."
10348780,10355300," Did you know that in Richmond, uh, gas stations have to be full service in order to preserve"
10355300,10356380," gas pumping jobs?"
10356380,10357780," I think that's okay."
10357780,10359420," So that is something that I've heard of before."
10359420,10363820," I think that is usually laughed at and is uncommon, but does happen."
10363820,10364820," Chat."
10364820,10366860," Loughly sort of speckled all over the place."
10366860,10371300," Chat, feel free to, okay, apparently there's a couple of states that have that exact same."
10371300,10373260," No, it's speckled all over the place."
10373260,10374260," I meant that genuinely."
10374260,10375700," I know it happens in a couple of states."
10375700,10380660," I know it happens in a few spots around Canada, but it's definitely uncommon."
10380660,10382580," I mean, it is not the norm."
10382580,10387620," I should say that the way that the car dealership industry has been preserved in general."
10387620,10388620," That's just wild."
10388620,10389620," That's lobbying."
10389620,10394100," Yeah, but the preserve our jobs."
10394100,10396140," Lobbying is pretty much job preservation."
10396140,10399180," If you really boil it down, I think, oh, wow."
10399180,10401100," I don't agree with that in the slightest."
10401100,10403600," I mean, okay."
10403600,10405660," It's economic abuse to a huge degree."
10405660,10406660," Well, okay."
10406660,10409020," I didn't say it wasn't abuse."
10409020,10412300," You specifically said it is this if you boil it down."
10412300,10413300," Yeah."
10413300,10415780," It's self-interested job preservation."
10415780,10416780," Then how about that?"
10416780,10421940," I don't know if it's saying, if someone's like, I want to make 40 million this year"
10421940,10426700," instead of 29 million this year, I don't know if saying that is job preservation."
10426700,10428220," I don't know if that's fair."
10428220,10431940," I don't think the average interest of lobbying is like, I want to make sure I can protect"
10431940,10433740," my huge swath of employees."
10433740,10434740," Well, right."
10434740,10440020," But unless you can keep your industry going strong, which, okay."
10440020,10441020," Okay."
10441020,10442940," I see where you're going with this."
10442940,10443940," I think it's usually--"
10443940,10447260," It's masquerades as job preservation then."
10447260,10449780," I mean, that's the argument that they'll make often."
10449780,10450780," Sure."
10450780,10451980," They just lie a lot."
10451980,10452980," Yeah."
10452980,10453980," Sure."
10453980,10456500," So profit preservation says flow plane chat."
10456500,10457500," Sure."
10457500,10464500," There are a very small amount of people that are extremely beyond delta above survival."
10464500,10467140," Well, okay."
10467140,10471020," It also does impact other people down the chain."
10471020,10472020," Sure."
10472020,10473500," Like it's--"
10473500,10476100," Not necessarily positively."
10476100,10482060," If your boss makes-- to use the example I just made, if your boss makes 40 million instead"
10482060,10486500," of 29 million, there is zero guarantee that that benefits you in any way whatsoever."
10486500,10487500," Yeah."
10487500,10494140," But your boss won't make any million if your industry goes the way of the ice harvesting"
10494140,10496700," industry than the ice harvesting boss."
10496700,10501940," I don't think all lobbying is that type of preservation though."
10501940,10502940," Okay."
10502940,10506540," Well, I mean, I'm open to an example."
10506540,10509180," I don't pay that much attention to lobbying."
10509180,10516140," A significant amount of it is being able to keep profits high by not following different"
10516140,10518300," ethical standards, whatever."
10518300,10523380," That isn't necessarily resisting your entire industry from disappearing."
10523380,10524540," That's keeping profits high."
10524540,10525540," Yeah."
10525540,10526540," I don't know."
10526540,10530620," I guess-- man, I'm just-- I'm thinking like, okay, another great example of lobbying,"
10530620,10535660," you know, keeping your industry from disappearing would be something like, like quick books,"
10535660,10537660," like personal tax software."
10537660,10540020," Like that's a really interesting rabbit hole."
10540020,10541460," That's a really intense lobbying thing."
10541460,10546300," If not for lobbying, that industry simply wouldn't need to exist."
10546300,10547300," It shouldn't."
10547300,10550540," And everyone who works in it from all the way to the top, all the way down to the bottom."
10550540,10551540," Yes, the bottom."
10551540,10552540," Could do something better for the world."
10552540,10553540," Would just be gone."
10553540,10554540," And yeah, could do something more useful."
10554540,10555540," Yeah."
10555540,10556540," So like I'm--"
10556540,10560140," Let's all hope they die faster than they currently are."
10560140,10561140," Yeah."
10561140,10562140," Yeah."
10562140,10565220," This is great float plane chats."
10565220,10568980," Cold take, f***ing lobbying, yeah, pretty much."
10568980,10571420," I mean, there is-- I am sure."
10571420,10575460," There is examples of good lobbying."
10575460,10577820," I never said it was good to be very good."
10577820,10578820," No, yeah, yeah."
10578820,10579820," Yeah, like that."
10579820,10581540," I'm sure there is good examples of it though."
10581540,10589380," It's just a system that is clearly vast majority of the time abused for hyper bad negative things."
10589380,10590860," No disagreement there?"
10590860,10591860," Yeah."
10591860,10594700," What was the question?"
10594700,10597180," Oh, right."
10597180,10598180," What--"
10598180,10599180," Oh, yeah."
10599180,10601380," Is there anything that we would do the--"
10601380,10602380," The like inefficient way on purpose?"
10602380,10606820," Would you do the hard way just to preserve the art of it almost?"
10606820,10607820," Nothing."
10607820,10610460," I mean, I guess I do some stuff the hard way."
10610460,10612100," Like, I don't know."
10612100,10614060," Well, no, OK, you just said to preserve the art of it."
10614060,10615060," Yeah, but it's not the art."
10615060,10616820," It's for practical purposes."
10616820,10623020," I don't think I would ever not use a dolly just so that I could like work out my arms more."
10623020,10624020," Yeah."
10624020,10625820," Well, no, because then there's like a health benefit."
10625820,10626820," There is a--"
10626820,10627820," Yeah."
10627820,10628820," OK, I would do that."
10628820,10629820," I would take the stairs if you were--"
10629820,10631340," There are examples though that fit this."
10631340,10633860," Yeah, not if efficiency was a factor."
10633860,10634860," There."
10634860,10635860," OK."
10635860,10640020," All right, let's get to you another one here."
10640020,10647520," Linus, YouTube suggested a Wanshow from 2013 where you wore a seemingly authentic CAD"
10647520,10653460," Pat Parca issued in the Canadian Armed Forces, wondering how you got one and if you kept"
10653460,10654460," it allegedly."
10654460,10655460," Isn't it gone?"
10655460,10657460," Yeah, I don't know what happened to it."
10657460,10658460," Yeah, that's awesome."
10658460,10662820," It's like that stupid Apple App Mark Pippin console."
10662820,10663940," Yeah, where the heck is that?"
10663940,10664940," I don't know."
10664940,10666260," It is gone."
10666260,10668260," It just disappeared."
10668260,10669780," That jacket disappeared."
10669780,10671740," I have no idea what happened to it."
10671740,10672740," My mom gave it to me."
10672740,10673740," It was a gift."
10673740,10678180," That jacket kept actually a very high number of people warm."
10678180,10679180," Yeah."
10679180,10680820," It was a helpful jacket."
10680820,10681820," Super warm."
10681820,10686260," When we were in like hyper startup mode working out of his garage, we didn't necessarily"
10686260,10690700," have a lot of heating and in winter months that jacket would be like passed around."
10690700,10693700," Because it was really warm."
10693700,10695500," Oh, man."
10695500,10700140," OK, last one I've got here, curated."
10700140,10705380," Why has an AMD released any new GPUs since the 7900 series in December?"
10705380,10708540," Why hold off releasing the mid-range cards?"
10708540,10714060," Leaks seem to say next launch is June when Nvidia's 4070 is out now."
10714060,10720660," The 60 is coming in May because it's really, really hard."
10720660,10727620," Just because the architecture is done and out there and on the market doesn't mean that"
10727620,10732060," those mid-tier chips are fully bug tested, right?"
10732060,10738260," Like, man, modern microprocessors, again, back to that hot take earlier, that consumer"
10738260,10741460," PC hardware is cheap."
10741460,10742460," They're a miracle."
10742460,10744340," They are actually an engineering marvel."
10744340,10748380," They're magic, basically, right?"
10748380,10753900," The fact that the 7900 series exists at all amazes me."
10753900,10754900," Never mind."
10754900,10755900," Where's the 7800?"
10755900,10756900," Where's the 7700?"
10756900,10761180," And I like, obviously, we want less expensive cards, right?"
10761180,10764540," Like, yeah, it's going to be one of the latest architecture."
10764540,10767340," But it's hard work."
10767340,10771620," It's hard grueling, difficult, time consuming work."
10771620,10774940," And a company like AMD has a lot going on."
10774940,10779140," They can't just focus on their discrete desktop GPUs."
10779140,10782460," They've also got their scientific and data center GPUs."
10782460,10788300," They've got the GPU products that are built into their CPUs now, which are no longer really"
10788300,10790940," lag behind by as much in terms of technology."
10790940,10795220," I would imagine that if their roadmap is anything to go on, we're going to see RDNA3,"
10795220,10802700," therefore, I GPUs with much less lag compared to the first appearance of that architecture"
10802700,10805660," on a desktop add-in card, right?"
10805660,10809300," Don't forget about the custom silicon work that they do for partners like Sony and Microsoft"
10809300,10810300," and Valve."
10810300,10816260," We have no idea what this chip in the Asus ROG Ally is, but apparently it's custom silicon"
10816260,10817260," as well."
10817260,10822740," And the thing is, you've only got, even if you're a company with the resources of AMD,"
10822740,10827580," you have a finite number of people on your team, right?"
10827580,10832140," And even if you saw a profitable opportunity, like, \"Oh yeah, let's bring our mid-range"
10832140,10835300," GPU to market faster.\""
10835300,10836900," You and what army?"
10836900,10842740," What, how many GPU experts are there on Earth that aren't already gainfully employed?"
10842740,10848060," It's not like you can just hire another 100 person to do, but it doesn't work like that,"
10848060,10849060," right?"
10849060,10852860," So, we just have to be patient as the bottom line."
10852860,10854580," It's, yeah, it's just frustrating, right?"
10854580,10856780," Like, obviously, yeah, where's RDNA4?"
10856780,10857780," Let's go!"
10857780,10859700," But it takes time."
10859700,10860700," It's really challenging."
10860700,10864620," A lot of massive respect for the people who work on this stuff."
10864620,10868660," All right, now that's the end of the curated."
10868660,10870220," Oh, okay."
10870220,10871500," I can just like curate some."
10871500,10872820," Yeah, go for it or..."
10872820,10873820," There's a massive..."
10873820,10874820," There's a massive..."
10874820,10876820," ...mountain of incoming messages that..."
10876820,10878820," They're all just like questions."
10878820,10879820," Trying to text response too."
10879820,10882580," We have a thing that can display them at the end of the show if we don't get to them"
10882580,10885380," or play the rest of the queue."
10885380,10889180," You know, new thing that we're trying, give it a go."
10889180,10890180," Yep."
10890180,10892180," I don't know how..."
10892180,10896300," Maybe you try to go through the massive mountain of messages and curate some of them"
10896300,10897540," while we do text responses."
10897540,10898780," Yeah, let's do it."
10898780,10899780," Sure."
10899780,10901500," Let's go."
10901500,10902500," This is cool."
10902500,10906780," \"Nicolas T. says, 'Hey Linus, I've been promoted to a new position where I measure"
10906780,10909420," individual transistors."
10909420,10913580," Feel strange to be doing a job you couldn't show."
10913580,10916780," Anything in particular surprised you during the lab tour at Micron."
10916780,10926420," I think the most surprising thing at Micron was just how jazzed everyone was to be there."
10926420,10931780," At somewhere like Nvidia, where they have a more consumer-facing brand, even someone"
10931780,10939300," like Intel, where they show up at gaming events and they have skulls and branding or whatever."
10939300,10940300," They're cool."
10940300,10946940," Yeah, you kind of expect to find path-passionate, enthusiast people."
10946940,10955340," But Micron has just about the most boring corporate image, I think, in the tech industry."
10955340,10956780," They're huge."
10956780,10958220," They're enormous."
10958220,10961460," They come from potato land."
10961460,10968860," They make gosh darn it, the stavlest DRAM chip."
10968860,10970660," Let's go."
10970660,10979260," But just how excited people seemed to work at Micron was really cool, really inspiring."
10979260,10986660," I managed to get one at that time."
10986660,10990180," This is from Justin, longtime vaud watcher and first-time buyer."
10990180,10994020," I work as a network engineer for a large US telecom company."
10994020,10999500," If you could change one thing about the telecom industry, what would it be?"
10999500,11002500," The fact that you work for a large US telecom company?"
11002500,11005380," No, I mean, well, sort of."
11005380,11011460," I really wish there was less consolidation in the telecom industry."
11011460,11020620," I can see that Mr. Ryan Reynolds came out virtually unscathed from that whole Mint Mobile sale."
11020620,11024860," Mint Mobile seemed like a good thing."
11024860,11026900," And now there's more consolidation."
11026900,11029260," So cool."
11029260,11036660," I would like to see more public ownership of basic infrastructure."
11036660,11044180," I mean, I think it's fair to say that in some ways, the fiber line between you and the nearest"
11044180,11051500," Internet exchange is more important than the road between you and the nearest city."
11051500,11058620," Like as long as you can get basics like food, water, shelter, there are entire industries"
11058620,11062340," that just run on those fiber lines and don't need a road."
11062340,11067300," When I was picking my apartment, that was a huge portion of the decision-making and a"
11067300,11068860," lot of people were quite surprised."
11068860,11072500," But like, I don't know, let's stand by it."
11072500,11075300," Okay, another one for you here."
11075300,11081380," This is from Lilith talking of the Stream Deck and Portables."
11081380,11086860," Do you think the future of them will be framework-like experience with modular parts so the product"
11086860,11088940," doesn't function like a console?"
11088940,11096620," I get outdated fast."
11096620,11098740," I don't think it's that realistic."
11098740,11100540," I think that..."
11100540,11107180," Ah, I mean, it could be done."
11107180,11109980," Framework has shown us that the limit was our imagination."
11109980,11112620," It wasn't the technology."
11112620,11115860," So it could be done, but it would take someone to come in and do it."
11115860,11124140," I mean, when a use was here for their ally preview, I told someone from their notebook"
11124140,11126540," team because it's the same team working on the ally."
11126540,11130260," I was like, \"Hey, have you guys seen the framework 16 yet?\""
11130260,11133460," And I'm like, \"No, I'm like, okay, you guys need to sit up and pay attention."
11133460,11134540," I'm an investor in framework."
11134540,11135860," I don't mind if they kick your butt.\""
11135860,11138980," But like, you guys need to sit up and pay attention."
11138980,11141140," You guys need to come map this head on."
11141140,11143500," This is a serious thing that's happening now."
11143500,11148740," There are going to be good devices that have taken this modular, more reusable approach"
11148740,11149740," to their design."
11149740,11154220," And you guys have got to figure this out because you can't just react to it later."
11154220,11161900," And I had made a joke about how the ally is pretty cool, but I'd rather have one that"
11161900,11166420," was made by someone like a framework where I don't have to buy a whole new one in order"
11166420,11169020," to keep using my..."
11169020,11171740," Oh crap."
11171740,11176340," My haul effect, joysticks that I already upgraded my chassis to or whatever else."
11176340,11178260," And they're like, \"Oh, well, I hope they don't get into it.\""
11178260,11181620," And I'm like, \"No, what you should hope is that you guys do a better job and make upgradeable"
11181620,11182620," stuff.\""
11182620,11187900," So yeah, I'd like to see it happen, but I don't know whether to hope for it or not."
11187900,11191900," More modular electronics, it just hasn't been the trend up until now."
11191900,11193740," It's hard when they get small like that too."
11193740,11198300," Yeah, and it is legitimately, actually really challenging."
11198300,11200220," You know, what's so great about the ally?"
11200220,11203820," Well, one of the things that's so great is it has this like phenomenal cooling system"
11203820,11207180," that is somehow super quiet and runs really cool."
11207180,11210140," I haven't opened it yet, actually haven't opened it yet, even though they're not here"
11210140,11211140," to supervise me anymore."
11211140,11212140," Why haven't I opened it yet?"
11212140,11217660," Anyway, I haven't opened it yet, but I would imagine that a really finely tuned cooling"
11217660,11223380," solution is going to make it more difficult to have that mainboard be upgradeable."
11223380,11229060," Okay, next up, Linus and Luke."
11229060,11234700," Any suggestions on courses or resources to take my tech troubleshooting skills from?"
11234700,11240300," Have you tried turning it on, on, back on again to something more refined?"
11240300,11241780," Really?"
11241780,11244820," Really depends what you more specifically want to get into."
11244820,11252740," If you're trying to get into like infrastructure stuff, IT admin type things, networking courses,"
11252740,11257900," networking certifications are often a pretty good angle to go in."
11257900,11264580," There's also some stuff you can do with, what's that?"
11264580,11267660," Active Directory, getting into Active Directory."
11267660,11270980," I'm assuming the direction you want to go into is IT."
11270980,11275620," I don't know if that's a good assumption or not, but yeah, I'll get into some certification"
11275620,11282460," courses for like networking, Active Directory, stuff like that."
11282460,11285300," Next up, high LL plus D."
11285300,11290860," Linus, do you know if there's any LTT garments that we either should or shouldn't use fabrics"
11290860,11292020," often are on?"
11292020,11296620," I was taught to always use it, but I've also heard that it isn't good for some fabrics."
11296620,11299740," I didn't know that."
11299740,11302660," So here's the thing."
11302660,11308620," Bridget and I, in particular Bridget and I, often butt heads about proper treatment of"
11308620,11310420," garments."
11310420,11315940," She will say things like, well, you're not supposed to put this in the dryer."
11315940,11318540," Oh, that's going to happen anyways."
11318540,11320700," I was getting there."
11320700,11329260," You're not supposed to put this in the dryer and this applique thing or whatever else"
11329260,11330780," and blah, blah, blah."
11330780,11332860," And I'm like, right."
11332860,11334980," But I'm going to put it in the dryer."
11334980,11339780," So where are we at with this?"
11339780,11345460," It drives her crazy because she and a lot of people on the team here do treat their clothes"
11345460,11347260," properly."
11347260,11355860," But I want us to try to make everything okay for the people who don't."
11355860,11356860," And you know what?"
11356860,11361500," You do have to treat your clothes properly, like a hoodie that you put in the dryer on"
11361500,11363340," high every time."
11363340,11366980," If it's cotton, like it will shrink."
11366980,11367980," It's natural fiber."
11367980,11369500," It behaves how it behaves."
11369500,11371500," And we can pre-shrink it and we do."
11371500,11377500," But there's a limit to what you can do with pre-shrinking."
11377500,11382140," So with all of that said, we strive to make it so you can kind of do whatever you want."
11382140,11386340," We do list the materials composition on our products as we're legally required to do."
11386340,11390940," So if there's any materials that are good or bad with fabric softener, I guess you can"
11390940,11394340," just sort of follow whatever guidelines you can find."
11394340,11401340," But in general, we kind of try to make things that are resilient last a long time."
11401340,11402340," Dan?"
11402340,11406580," No, I didn't unmute myself."
11406580,11408740," All right."
11408740,11412500," Last one I've got here is Salivir and droid Bashir channel."
11412500,11418060," My question to Linus is, what do you think about tech channels releasing videos a couple"
11418060,11421540," minutes ahead of the official NDA timeline?"
11421540,11426140," Things happened multiple times."
11426140,11428100," Oh."
11428100,11433660," That's an interesting question."
11433660,11436260," I did it once."
11436260,11437260," Maybe twice?"
11437260,11438260," I don't know."
11438260,11443020," We released a video like one minute before the actual official embargo lift."
11443020,11447020," And I think the idea was to see if it would have any kind of impact."
11447020,11452780," And what we determined was that A, no one noticed or cared and B, it didn't have an"
11452780,11454980," impact."
11454980,11457100," Yeah."
11457100,11464540," In the long term, what I've found is that, I mean here, I can show you guys this, right?"
11464540,11467540," Like here, let's go into the channel dashboard."
11467540,11469460," Let's head to the analytics, shall we?"
11469460,11472860," You guys want to see some analytics?"
11472860,11473860," Yes."
11473860,11476860," I know I do."
11476860,11480740," These, these, itics be anal."
11480740,11483300," Nice one."
11483300,11484300," Ding?"
11484300,11486380," No, that's not worth a ding."
11486380,11487380," That's not even a joke."
11487380,11488380," That's just stupid."
11488380,11489380," It's over there."
11489380,11490380," It's not worth it."
11490380,11493220," It's too far away."
11493220,11494220," No dings for anal."
11494220,11495780," You can tell what time of night it is."
11495780,11496780," All right."
11496780,11501060," So first things first, you can see there's some videos coming soon."
11501060,11505020," What's it like to work at Linus Media Group, the sequel?"
11505020,11506180," Did anyone talk to you?"
11506180,11507180," Oh, really?"
11507180,11508180," Interesting."
11508180,11509780," Adam was in charge this time."
11509780,11510780," Not included."
11510780,11511780," All right."
11511780,11515220," Well, I guess you don't really work at LMG for most of the period we're covering here."
11515220,11522260," So also we have another one pushing the GT 1030 to the max."
11522260,11524620," They'll have better titles when we actually release them."
11524620,11526500," So here, let's find a, let's find a video."
11526500,11528540," Okay, here, here, here, here's one."
11528540,11531260," No, this is the cleanest setup."
11531260,11534620," So let's go into, what is it, reach?"
11534620,11535620," I hate."
11535620,11537620," I still hate this dashboard."
11537620,11540340," Oh, a bunch of really positive feedback on that video, by the way."
11540340,11541340," Inferior."
11541340,11542340," Because it's already on Flow Play."
11542340,11543860," Oh, which one?"
11543860,11546700," The, the, what it's like to work at LMG."
11546700,11547700," Oh, really?"
11547700,11548700," Yeah."
11548700,11549700," Okay."
11549700,11550700," Well, I'm not allowed to watch it."
11550700,11551700," So I guess I'm just a Flow Play chat."
11551700,11552700," Just said it's really good."
11552700,11555740," Oh, I'm glad it's, I'm really glad it's good."
11555740,11556740," Cool."
11556740,11557740," All right."
11557740,11561900," Anywho, what am I looking for?"
11561900,11562900," Ah, yes."
11562900,11563900," Impressions."
11563900,11564900," No man."
11564900,11565900," Oh, yeah."
11565900,11566900," Here we go."
11566900,11567900," Here we go."
11567900,11568900," We're just like Flashbanged, everyone, by the way."
11568900,11569900," Oh, sorry."
11569900,11570900," Yeah, sorry."
11570900,11572900," I don't have dark reader on this profile."
11572900,11573900," Okay."
11573900,11574900," Bell notification sent."
11574900,11575900," Here we go."
11575900,11582300," They sent 911,000 subscribers a notification."
11582300,11589020," The click-through rate is within the typical range for YouTube of 0.5 to 2.5%, 1.1%, which"
11589020,11594620," means our views from Bell notifications as a channel with 14, 15, however many millions"
11594620,11598100," of subscribers was 9,800."
11598100,11602100," That's actually kind of amazing."
11602100,11608060," This is a video with 3 million views."
11608060,11612740," Total impressions, 38.2 million with a click-through rate of 5.4."
11612740,11618700," The click-through rate of your impressions that you get from browse features, suggested"
11618700,11628660," videos, all these places that actually matter at all is 3 times, no, no, over 4 times higher."
11628660,11638460," So the only thing that launching a little bit early could possibly do for you is give"
11638460,11644340," you a bit of an early boost on those like notification views, right?"
11644340,11648740," Because one minute later, everyone's going to be on pretty much equal footing when it"
11648740,11653980," comes to browse and suggested and all that stuff."
11653980,11657860," We're at the point now where we don't even really pay attention to what time of day we"
11657860,11661580," launch a video because we know that it's all going to come out in the wash in the long"
11661580,11663460," term."
11663460,11665220," So that's where we're at on it."
11665220,11667300," I really don't think it's a big deal."
11667300,11671420," And I do think it's a big deal to break a legal agreement that you've signed."
11671420,11675220," So you just should launch at the right time, like everyone just should."
11675220,11678860," But I don't think it's a big deal for you."
11678860,11682660," I don't think you're at a competitive disadvantage if other narrative wells are pulling these"
11682660,11684660," kinds of moves."
11684660,11685660," Okay."
11685660,11688060," Oh, hold on a second."
11688060,11693140," Android bashe is in the chat saying, \"It might not impact you, but trust me, myself and"
11693140,11699740," several other channels I know have seen noticeable drops at the first hour reach.\""
11699740,11712060," Yeah, but that first hour, the first hour is important, but it also isn't."
11712060,11714380," Big picture."
11714380,11717940," You've got to be looking at click through."
11717940,11722460," You've got to be looking at retention because that is ultimately what is going to drive"
11722460,11724100," that piece of content."
11724100,11729100," And that's a real challenge."
11729100,11731100," It's way harder."
11731100,11735340," Being the first one with content is a valid strategy."
11735340,11740140," It's even a good strategy, but it's an exhausting strategy."
11740140,11741780," And it's a very challenging strategy."
11741780,11744740," And I don't think it's a sustainable strategy."
11744740,11746260," Okay."
11746260,11749100," Got another one here for you."
11749100,11754340," So, Madison Luke, thoughts on Nebula's $250 lifetime membership."
11754340,11756380," Isn't V2O streaming expensive?"
11756380,11759980," Is it retargeted with the SIRI or did you and I just talk about that?"
11759980,11763380," I think you and I were talking about that."
11763380,11764380," Yeah."
11764380,11765380," Okay."
11765380,11767860," So, Nebula is an interesting model, right?"
11767860,11777020," As far as I can tell, not a lot of people are actually watching on the site, and that"
11777020,11778860," doesn't really matter to them."
11778860,11784140," Like I don't think that really matters because it's far more of a just like, \"Hey, I want"
11784140,11785980," to support creators.\""
11785980,11795260," Here's a very sort of small amount of financial contribution of which very little makes its"
11795260,11799020," way to the individual creator, right?"
11799020,11800980," Because you're not subscribing to an individual creator."
11800980,11802980," You're subscribing to the entire platform."
11802980,11807020," So each creator is getting a very small fraction of that amount."
11807020,11808260," That's just sort of inherent."
11808260,11812820," If you actually watched a lot on the platform."
11812820,11818540," But the benefit of it is that they can achieve a level of scale that particularly boosted"
11818540,11824220," by the cross promotion that they do with CuriosityStream has enabled them to reach a"
11824220,11829540," subscriber count that is quite substantial."
11829540,11834460," So they've got these subscribers, right?"
11834460,11839460," They've got this sort of, yeah, so they've got this user count."
11839460,11843900," They've got this roster of creators that as far as I can tell are not really making a"
11843900,11847580," ton of money just from Nebula payouts."
11847580,11853780," As far as I can tell, a lot of the financial incentive for creators is promoting, subscribing"
11853780,11858660," to CuriosityStream because it includes Nebula."
11858660,11863220," And so, which is good for creators because they get some revenue from Nebula."
11863220,11866140," But more importantly, they have an ownership stake in Nebula."
11866140,11870300," So any creators who join Nebula have an ownership stake in the platform."
11870300,11875260," And that's as far as I can tell, as an outsider, the real point."
11875260,11881820," I don't think the point is the actual monthly checks that a creator with 20,000 YouTube"
11881820,11886860," subscribers and however many people are watching them on Nebula because you can kind of extrapolate"
11886860,11890380," that it's like probably like four people, right?"
11890380,11895340," So I don't think they're getting a significant amount of money on a monthly basis from Nebula."
11895340,11904900," But I think the goal is that when Nebula exits, when it sells, everyone who joined as a creator,"
11904900,11909780," everyone who joined as a creator is going to get a piece of that action."
11909780,11915660," So with that in mind, what does a $250 lifetime subscription to a streaming platform look like?"
11915660,11920340," Well, it looks like a streaming platform that doesn't actually stream a lot of video."
11920340,11927220," They're wanting to boost subscriber counts so that when they eventually exit in some way,"
11927220,11931860," or IPO or whatever it is that they plan to do, they will be able to have a bigger payout"
11931860,11935780," for their shareholders who are the creators, which is not a bad thing."
11935780,11939340," It's just a very different model from the way that we structure things, which is generally"
11939340,11945340," more ongoing sustainability and less exit strategy focused."
11945340,11949780," You also sometimes just need a burst of, I've been trying to respond to messages so I didn't"
11949780,11955780," listen to all of that, but you sometimes need a burst of income if you're trying to avoid"
11955780,11958180," outside investor stuff."
11958180,11963420," And it might be worth lower returns in the future for that burst of income now, depending"
11963420,11966420," on what you're trying to do."
11966420,11972460," There's like a lot."
11972460,11975860," There's too many sitting in incoming."
11975860,11977940," We need to be responding to these faster."
11977940,11982940," Yeah, I'm bumping on it."
11982940,11984180," We can talk about this."
11984180,11985180," Hit me."
11985180,11986180," Hit me."
11986180,11987420," All right, anonymous."
11987420,11991620," Have you ever seen a surface electron display monitor?"
11991620,11994700," If not, do you think you can get a hold of one?"
11994700,11996180," Ever heard of one of these?"
11996180,11997180," SED."
11997180,11998180," SED monitor."
11998180,12002460," My understanding is outside of a couple of trade show demos, they'd never existed."
12002460,12008980," It was supposed to be a replacement for CRT that was not as thin as LCD, but with the"
12008980,12014220," contrast and brightness benefits of CRT and response time benefits of CRT if a cannon"
12014220,12016140," was working on it, if I recall correctly."
12016140,12021300," I was very excited about it at the time, if it's the one I'm thinking of."
12021300,12028020," And I was really disappointed that it never made it to light, but OLED has pretty much"
12028020,12031860," negated any need for SED to make it to market."
12031860,12033340," All right."
12033340,12039820," What are the odds of LTT partnering with iFixit for an orange and black precision driver kit?"
12039820,12042060," Um, I don't know."
12042060,12046540," I don't really know if that's like iFixit's model."
12046540,12053220," I, yeah, I could definitely see us doing more tools in the future, but I don't really see"
12053220,12058300," any reason why either of us would necessarily co-brand with the other."
12058300,12063700," Like having more hands in the pot is, I don't know, not really, not really beneficial to"
12063700,12064700," either of us."
12064700,12067740," I don't think."
12067740,12069860," Love your work and would love to work for you."
12069860,12072780," Do you guys still offer relocation assistance?"
12072780,12077740," I don't know why you get a job and find out."
12077740,12079740," Check our job postings."
12079740,12089820," Let's see, any chance on releasing a case for screwdriver that can also fit all the bitsets?"
12089820,12095180," Um, yes, it'll be a long time though."
12095180,12096660," You know how slow we are."
12096660,12100860," And that's a product that I don't think we would do just like a less expensive, faster"
12100860,12104580," Chinese mold for like we did for the cable management arches."
12104580,12110980," That's the kind of product that we would probably want to get done by, um, I TD."
12110980,12115300," It's either innovative or innovation tool and die, something like a local company."
12115300,12119220," We'd probably get the molds made there because we'd wanted to be like on par with the quality"
12119220,12120820," of the screwdriver that it goes with, right?"
12120820,12125060," So I don't see that happening anytime super soon."
12125060,12128780," What is your favorite small form factor case right now?"
12128780,12136100," Oh, we were actually shooting a video about this new one from Dan case that is just so"
12136100,12137100," cool."
12137100,12138900," Adam was telling me about it."
12138900,12140340," It looks amazing."
12140340,12141340," Yeah."
12141340,12142900," What's the man?"
12142900,12143900," But dang it."
12143900,12144900," Is it?"
12144900,12146860," Oh, is it out?"
12146860,12151020," Uh, yeah, yeah, this one."
12151020,12152020," Okay."
12152020,12153020," Super cool."
12153020,12154020," Yeah."
12154020,12155020," C4S effects."
12155020,12156740," This thing is sick."
12156740,12157740," It's sick."
12157740,12158740," That's the video."
12158740,12159740," It's sick."
12159740,12161380," That's all I have to say about that."
12161380,12164380," I built one in the previous Dan case and it was just incredible."
12164380,12165660," No, this one's so much better."
12165660,12166660," I know."
12166660,12167660," Your Dan case is crap."
12167660,12168660," That's okay."
12168660,12169660," I gave it a little bit of time."
12169660,12172100," Your name is Dan and you still don't know anything about Dan case anymore."
12172100,12173100," I know nothing."
12173100,12174100," It's new Dan case."
12174100,12175100," It's a new game."
12175100,12176100," Oh my gosh."
12176100,12177100," I've been replaced."
12177100,12178100," Uh, okay."
12178100,12183220," Uh, as someone who's watched since the kitchen set days, is there any videos you look"
12183220,12189460," back on from the early days of LTT and want to recreate for old time's sake?"
12189460,12190460," Oh."
12190460,12191460," Recreat."
12191460,12194940," I mean, I wish we could do classic scrapyard wars again."
12194940,12198300," Yeah, just we had a question about that in the pre-show and I was like, man, it just"
12198300,12199660," doesn't, it can't work."
12199660,12200660," It doesn't work."
12200660,12201660," Yeah."
12201660,12202660," Then I don't know."
12202660,12203660," It's funny."
12203660,12207940," Like, yeah, I'd love to, I'd love to do whole room water cooling again, but we can't just"
12207940,12211380," interrupt everyone's jobs to help us put fittings on things anymore."
12211380,12213540," Just, just doesn't really like work that way here."
12213540,12214700," It's certain scale issues."
12214700,12215700," Yeah."
12215700,12221620," I've fairly often come back to the like, this is not that old of a video."
12221620,12222620," Okay."
12222620,12226820," It's a very old video, but it's not that old of a video in kitchen in the house scale."
12226820,12228020," You know what I mean?"
12228020,12231980," But the WTF is going on with the X12 and Vulcan."
12231980,12234380," I've often just kind of personally wondered that."
12234380,12237380," Like what's the current state of those?"
12237380,12243860," Because like when I launch a game and I see options right now, I don't, I'm not a hundred"
12243860,12247900," percent confident in which one to choose, you know?"
12247900,12248900," So yeah."
12248900,12250260," Go Vulcan, be cool."
12250260,12256340," Well, no, but even like, okay, because that video went more in depth on these things,"
12256340,12260260," even when it's like, do you want to launch in DX11 or DX12?"
12260260,12262260," If it's only DX is the option."
12262260,12265220," For a while there, it was 11, not 12."
12265220,12266220," Uh-huh."
12266220,12271620," I mean, I still have issues with like, ano as far as I know, just like never patched the"
12271620,12272620," bugginess."
12272620,12276300," No, but like for real, a lot of games that came around that era, it was better to run"
12276300,12278300," them in DX11 than 12."
12278300,12282620," So like, is that completely fixed for new games?"
12282620,12285020," What kind of stragglers are we looking at?"
12285020,12286020," Stuff like that."
12286020,12288860," That'd be interesting."
12288860,12290660," Okay."
12290660,12296900," Luke, are there any plans for adding split screen support for the iPad OS app on float"
12296900,12297900," plane?"
12297900,12301980," We don't really do specific for iPad development."
12301980,12303820," Um, got them."
12303820,12307060," So like, not in the near future."
12307060,12311580," And Linus, any timeline on the luxury backpack?"
12311580,12318100," Ugh, this is probably a question you were expecting me to answer extremely quickly."
12318100,12319820," Oh boy."
12319820,12320820," It's not though."
12320820,12321820," Um, okay."
12321820,12324140," First of all, it's not luxury."
12324140,12325140," It's lux."
12325140,12329740," That is what we're going to call it."
12329740,12331300," We're just going to call it lux."
12331300,12332300," Okay."
12332300,12333300," All right."
12333300,12334300," Bye."
12334300,12337180," Second of all, I don't know."
12337180,12342060," I don't want to release something that I'm not completely confident in."
12342060,12347060," And right now, I'm really happy with the state that it's in."
12347060,12351860," But what I don't know is how long will I be happy with the state that it's in?"
12351860,12352860," So whoops."
12352860,12355060," What I press."
12355060,12357460," Um, yeah, there we go."
12357460,12359060," Thanks, Dan."
12359060,12361020," So okay."
12361020,12363580," There's a couple of things that are wrong with this prototype."
12363580,12366100," The water bottle holder is a little bit too tight."
12366100,12370180," I have a similar issue with some of the pockets over here."
12370180,12374580," Other than that, it's basically, it's basically perfect."
12374580,12379700," Uh, I've noticed that as it's broken in, this zipper at the very front, this one, this one"
12379700,12384940," right here has turned from kind of straight to, uh, you can't really knock and we'll see"
12384940,12387140," that to more of like, uh, like a smile."
12387140,12388300," Like it's kind of, oh yeah, here we go."
12388300,12389300," Here's a better angle."
12389300,12390820," Get you guys this angle here."
12390820,12392900," So it's more like, kind of curved now."
12392900,12396820," So you can see that, but that's like a natural thing that's going to happen with a, with"
12396820,12397980," a leather product, right?"
12397980,12402700," Like it tends to, you know, you can see the water bottle bulge a little bit more than you"
12402700,12408340," could see with the, um, uh, with the, oh, it starts with an R or whatever, with the"
12408340,12412620," reprieve fabric that we use for the regular backpack."
12412620,12421420," Um, my issue is that this is an, a vegan leather, which is like probably the most successful"
12421420,12424180," rebrand in all of history."
12424180,12425780," Leather, to vegan leather."
12425780,12426780," To vegan leather."
12426780,12427780," Yeah."
12427780,12429780," Like fake leather to vegan leather."
12429780,12430780," Yeah."
12430780,12434620," Anyway, this is, this is a vegan leather product, but it's not just like plastic."
12434620,12436460," Um, this is an apple leather."
12436460,12442820," So it's like a, like a fruit based vegan leather that behaves."
12442820,12447260," Boy, does it ever feel and act a lot like leather."
12447260,12453100," Um, from the manufacturer, they've told us that you can, you can kind of, you could buff"
12453100,12455460," scuffs out of it with, with polish."
12455460,12456700," Just like with leather."
12456700,12460180," Um, they've told us the durability should be very similar to leather."
12460180,12464260," I haven't observed any issues with it in my time using it, but I've only been using"
12464260,12467020," it for a couple months."
12467020,12472980," Can I draw long term, you know, years long conclusions about this fabric based on the"
12472980,12475220," time I've spent with it."
12475220,12478740," Um, not with 100% confidence."
12478740,12480700," And this is not going to be a cheap product."
12480700,12487460," Uh, I would be surprised if it isn't at least double of what the regular backpack costs,"
12487460,12493820," because A, the material is far more costly and B, working with it is far more costly."
12493820,12496660," It's far more time consuming."
12496660,12501500," So it's pretty much ready for us to place an order."
12501500,12505940," We would have to make a couple small changes to the, uh, to the construction and we're ready"
12505940,12507300," to go."
12507300,12515220," But I've been holding off because I just want it to be really good and I don't like, I've"
12515220,12519300," asked if, uh, so, so, uh, we have a partner that does a lot of material testing for us"
12519300,12524300," called Chima and I've asked, is there anything we can do in terms of like long term durability"
12524300,12525300," tests on it?"
12525300,12528340," Like can we do scuff tests and then can we get polishes and try to polish it?"
12528340,12530980," Like what can we do to, can you figure this out guys?"
12530980,12532620," Um, and so we're working on that."
12532620,12534180," But it's going to take time."
12534180,12538820," We've got a lot of people in the chat asking, well, why not just make it out of real leather?"
12538820,12542660," Do you want it to be $1,500 to grand?"
12542660,12547060," Oh, my like, okay."
12547060,12551740," Yeah, that would be a, leather is fricking hard."
12551740,12556380," And like if you're spending that much on leather, uh, seam stitching can be an issue."
12556380,12558100," So are these hand stitched bags now?"
12558100,12559100," Yeah."
12559100,12560220," Well, yeah, that's the thing, right?"
12560220,12561220," Yeah."
12561220,12565780," I'm adding that clarification because I'm sure someone's googling how much leather costs"
12565780,12568660," and they're going to be like, Oh, it's the workmanship."
12568660,12570340," There's more to it than that."
12570340,12571340," Yeah."
12571340,12572340," Okay."
12572340,12573340," Okay."
12573340,12574340," Okay."
12574340,12577340," Um, okay."
12577340,12580340," Uh, okay."
12580340,12582340," Um, okay."
12582340,12588780," Well, yeah, we might have to, we might have to call it."
12588780,12592140," Are there, are there any more like outstanding ones you guys see in this?"
12592140,12596860," You guys are sending, you guys got to send more just like, Hey, hi mom, you know, stuff"
12596860,12599780," because we actually can't do this."
12599780,12602900," Uh, yes, the UV blocking hoodie is still coming."
12602900,12605820," Um, you know what?"
12605820,12608860," Why don't we try and rapid fire a few?"
12608860,12610500," Let's, let's try it."
12610500,12611500," Sure."
12611500,12612500," Okay."
12612500,12615700," How are scientific anonymous asks, how are scientific backgrounds understood or perceived"
12615700,12618100," within the software development field?"
12618100,12620220," I've coming from an astrophysicist."
12620220,12621700," How are scientific backgrounds?"
12621700,12622700," That's not rapid fire enough."
12622700,12623700," He's shrugged."
12623700,12624700," Next question."
12624700,12625700," Okay."
12625700,12629260," Robert says, can't wait to set this up on my test bench at work."
12629260,12631420," Microsoft loop just went live for my org."
12631420,12635900," What's one non AI product that is upcoming or live that you guys, especially Dan are"
12635900,12639820," super excited for non AI product."
12639820,12642020," Yeah, I can read these two."
12642020,12643020," Okay."
12643020,12644860," So what is it?"
12644860,12646020," It's especially Dan."
12646020,12649140," Uh, I didn't actually catch that."
12649140,12650140," I don't know."
12650140,12652380," Um, non tech products."
12652380,12654380," No, non AI."
12654380,12655380," Non AI product."
12655380,12657580," This rapid fire concept is not working very well."
12657580,12659580," Oh, okay."
12659580,12661260," Let's, let's read along with you then."
12661260,12666980," Uh, non AI, uh, a are, a are, I want a are to be good one day."
12666980,12667980," Love it."
12667980,12668980," Okay."
12668980,12673380," Adam, if there's going to be a Linus Tech tips TV series or movie, who would you cast"
12673380,12675340," to play you?"
12675340,12676900," Reynolds."
12676900,12679140," To play you?"
12679140,12680140," Yeah."
12680140,12682140," Oh, I was thinking, um, the other Ryan."
12682140,12684780," I've just had the amount of times."
12684780,12688700," Do you remember the, the, the Ryan Gosling?"
12688700,12690380," Ryan Gosling looks so much more like you."
12690380,12691380," Sorry."
12691380,12692380," That's the one I meant."
12692380,12693380," I'm really bad with actor names."
12693380,12694380," I'm trying out loud."
12694380,12695380," Yeah."
12695380,12696380," Ryan Gosling for Luke."
12696380,12697380," You would nail it."
12697380,12698380," Yeah."
12698380,12699380," I'm with that."
12699380,12700380," That is who I meant."
12700380,12701380," I apologize."
12701380,12702380," I have no idea for me."
12702380,12703380," I'm sorry."
12703380,12704380," I also don't know too many actors."
12704380,12705380," Okay."
12705380,12706380," Next."
12706380,12707380," Oh, okay."
12707380,12708380," I was okay."
12708380,12709380," Okay."
12709380,12710380," Hello gentlemen."
12710380,12711820," What is your favorite controller to use with PC?"
12711820,12713780," It's the Xbox controller for both of us."
12713780,12715380," Um, other than us and keyboard."
12715380,12716380," PS4 for him."
12716380,12717380," Xbox for us."
12717380,12718380," Cool."
12718380,12719380," Oh, yeah."
12719380,12720380," Stick drift."
12720380,12721380," Yaps."
12721380,12722380," Yeah."
12722380,12723380," Sorry."
12723380,12724380," That's a thing."
12724380,12725780," Um, so I really like the King Kong too, but I don't use it on PC mostly because I just"
12725780,12726780," haven't."
12726780,12727780," I just, I just didn't think of it."
12727780,12728780," I just have it."
12728780,12731180," I have it paired to my switch and I just didn't think about it."
12731180,12732180," Yeah."
12732180,12733180," Okay."
12733180,12738020," Uh, Ian, in the spirit of the AI heavy show this week with the potential of AI providing"
12738020,12742780," scammers with more powerful tools, has anyone thought of newer safety measures to take?"
12742780,12743780," That's going to be a big problem."
12743780,12747420," All I've really seen is AI fighting back."
12747420,12749820," That's the only new thing I've seen in that room."
12749820,12754380," Jared says, I'm a brand new mainframe storage admin and I was super excited to see your"
12754380,12756780," Z16 and mainframe mention last when."
12756780,12760580," Do you foresee any other potential future uses in mainframe tech?"
12760580,12766980," I mean, I think, I think Luke kind of outlined what is going to be the biggest one is these"
12766980,12768780," internal large language models."
12768780,12771660," Like that's the way I think, I think you're right."
12771660,12772860," I don't think there's any avoiding it."
12772860,12776260," I think I call it was that like three weeks ago when I talked to you in your office and"
12776260,12780180," I was like, this is like my most long shot one so far."
12780180,12781540," Yeah, there's companies already doing it."
12781540,12784980," I thought it was like a year out."
12784980,12786340," It's 100% already happening."
12786340,12793180," So Paul L asks, ever considered consulting services like matpat from game theorist LTT's"
12793180,12796700," culture employee customer treatment are really powerful for professionals and orgs."
12796700,12798900," They often ground me when managing people."
12798900,12802460," I mean, the way that I see it, here it is."
12802460,12803860," You're asking me, we're talking about it."
12803860,12804860," Let's talk about it."
12804860,12807060," Not for very long because this is rapid fire."
12807060,12812540," But the point is that I don't know, my uncle kind of sat me down and said, you know, the"
12812540,12814940," worst kind of business is a consulting business."
12814940,12817060," And I kind of said, oh, well, why?"
12817060,12820260," Because like consulting seems like it pays a lot of money."
12820260,12821700," Consultants like that's a stereotype, right?"
12821700,12826260," As consultants make a lot of money compared to people who in a lot of cases are actually"
12826260,12827260," do things."
12827260,12833540," And he said, the reason the consulting business is the worst kind of business is because it's"
12833540,12834620," not scalable."
12834620,12837980," If you want to double your revenue, then you can raise your rates."
12837980,12844220," Sure, you could double your rates, but there's a finite amount of doubling that you can do"
12844220,12845380," to your rates."
12845380,12848420," So what you need to do then is you need to double your consultants."
12848420,12850660," You need to double your staff."
12850660,12856420," And at some point, you collapse under your own weight unless you can somehow scale the"
12856420,12861980," consulting that you do to many, many more people per consultant."
12861980,12863060," I kind of went, oh, okay."
12863060,12864620," So like YouTube then."
12864620,12865620," Okay."
12865620,12866620," So we've solved this."
12866620,12868380," I don't need to be a one on one consultant anymore."
12868380,12871940," I could just, you know, I could just scale."
12871940,12876740," And so we, we, everything we do here, we're trying to even Wancho, right?"
12876740,12880340," So how can we scale Wancho by doing it faster?"
12880340,12881340," Yes."
12881340,12882340," Thank you, Luke."
12882340,12883340," That's very helpful."
12883340,12886420," So by chopping it up into clips."
12886420,12893700," So you know, by, by leveraging it to sponsors and also leveraging AdSense and also creating"
12893700,12898380," benefits to float plane subscribers to subscribe for a better Wancho experience with better"
12898380,12905780," audio quality by creating merch messages so that we can create more content for Wancho."
12905780,12909020," Thanks to you guys asking wonderful questions like this."
12909020,12912340," So we're, we're quadruple dipping on Wancho."
12912340,12917380," That's something that a consulting business is always going to struggle with because unless"
12917380,12923060," you can find and train consultants at an astronomical rate, you're always going to be"
12923060,12926100," limited to linear rather than exponential growth."
12926100,12931120," Daniel asks, I was wondering if you could explain some of the benefits and drawbacks"
12931120,12935260," of building a home PC in a rack versus a tower."
12935260,12940340," Tower is easier, better hardware compatibility, racks go in racks."
12940340,12943900," That's the main benefit of them."
12943900,12948580," What happened to the G Suite Google Drive backup too slow or too close to privateering?"
12948580,12950740," I think we ran into some issues with it."
12950740,12955540," Jake would actually be a better person to answer that question."
12955540,12957660," I think it had something to do with rate limiting or something."
12957660,12962340," Yeah, I think it was over-comable, but it was like going to involve a bunch of like hassle"
12962340,12965740," and scripting and realistically it was going to like cost a bunch of money to actually take"
12965740,12967700," the data back out if we ever needed it anyway."
12967700,12969900," We just didn't really carry that much because it's the vault."
12969900,12972060," This is like a proof of concept worth anything."
12972060,12975500," Charles says, are you concerned about Creator Warehouse working with other creators when"
12975500,12978660," they come to you with a product that you've either been thinking about making or a product"
12978660,12979660," you think you could do better?"
12979660,12981860," Yeah, this is a very valid concern."
12981860,12985740," If we're kind of, okay, actually there's a perfect example of this."
12985740,12988780," We wanted to do a lighter for a really long time."
12988780,12991300," We had some cool fun ideas for a lighter project."
12991300,12996140," Kyle actually talked about it in his float plane exclusive, Meet the Team."
12996140,12998860," I was looking at Hacksmith's lighter."
12998860,13003580," They have a one coming or something and we wanted to carry it on our store and I was"
13003580,13007100," like, okay, are we going to be in an awkward position where if we release a lighter they're"
13007100,13011020," going to feel like, oh, screw you buddy, you're releasing your own lighter."
13011020,13013460," I don't know."
13013460,13014460," There's a precedent for it."
13014460,13018660," It's not like Newegg doesn't carry Roseville cases, which is their home brand and they"
13018660,13019660," also carry Corsair cases."
13019660,13022300," You just have to be seems chill with it."
13022300,13026420," Even more, not that you aren't already, but even more careful to not have things that"
13026420,13028900," could be perceived as like a copycat."
13028900,13029900," Yeah."
13029900,13032380," Yeah, that's fair."
13032380,13036460," Michael asks, do you have any advice or regrets on raising children in regards to technology"
13036460,13037460," or the internet?"
13037460,13038980," Don't use it as a crutch."
13038980,13040740," Talk to kids."
13040740,13042940," That's the key."
13042940,13047660," Joseph, I remember when the streams, not the camo coat, we're talking about the camo"
13047660,13051540," coat again, a decade ago in high school, you inspired me to build a PC so I could play"
13051540,13053660," Planet Side 2 in Battlefield 3."
13053660,13056820," What is your most nostalgic gaming era?"
13056820,13063180," Google Great Games 2004, man."
13063180,13064420," Great Games 2004."
13064420,13066260," It's a thing."
13066260,13070220," I think my nostalgic gaming era goes back farther though."
13070220,13073820," I think it's more just like when you kind of crystallized when you..."
13073820,13076060," 2004 was just a hell of a year though."
13076060,13077060," I'm actually like pretty..."
13077060,13078060," I think we've talked about this."
13078060,13081260," Did Warcraft 3 come out in 2004 because I was going to say Warcraft?"
13081260,13086540," Half-Life 2, Original World of Warcraft, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, The Sims 2, Halo"
13086540,13094140," 2, Burnout 3, Far Cry the Original, Counter Strike Source, Battlefield Vietnam, Star Wars Battlefront,"
13094140,13101200," the one that people actually liked, Doom 3, Metal Gear 3, Sid Meier's Pirates, Fable"
13101200,13108220," Unreal 2004, Ninja Gaiden, Driver, which I actually thought was cool but not everyone"
13108220,13110940," thinks he's cool."
13110940,13116300," There's Star Wars, Knights of the Old Republic 2."
13116300,13117540," Best year in gaming ever."
13117540,13119300," Splinter Cell, Pandora tomorrow."
13119300,13121980," I don't know if that was great or not."
13121980,13122980," Okay."
13122980,13124380," It wasn't pretty wild here."
13124380,13127380," That's fair enough but I think for me it's got to be like SNES era."
13127380,13128380," Yeah."
13128380,13129620," Yeah, I'm just old."
13129620,13130620," That's fine."
13130620,13134500," I like talking about 2004 because there's one hell of a year."
13134500,13138380," Alright, I replied to a couple of text ones."
13138380,13139580," Are they still coming in?"
13139580,13140580," Yeah."
13140580,13142900," You've got to do one every 25 seconds."
13142900,13143900," Come on guys."
13143900,13145700," Is that the rate?"
13145700,13148820," Well not today but most of the day."
13148820,13151500," Yeah, you guys were just basically treading water with these."
13151500,13153620," I'm sorry to dump that on you."
13153620,13154620," That was okay."
13154620,13155620," We just got to keep pumping."
13155620,13156620," We'll figure it out."
13156620,13157620," The current rise of AI technology."
13157620,13160020," What do you think about students pursuing careers as web developers?"
13160020,13161020," I was currently..."
13161020,13162020," I replied to that one."
13162020,13163020," I said pretty tough right now."
13163020,13164660," It's pretty tough right now."
13164660,13165660," We will still..."
13165660,13166660," Hold on."
13166660,13170260," We will still need developers for like a long time."
13170260,13174300," People saying that it's going to fully replace developers right now are just wrong."
13174300,13178460," Speaking of that, I think you already replied to that one too."
13178460,13179460," Yeah."
13179460,13180460," It was gone."
13180460,13181460," Okay."
13181460,13182460," What's going on?"
13182460,13183460," Keep going."
13183460,13185740," I think we're all doing the same things on top of each other."
13185740,13188260," But yeah, we're going to need developers for a long time."
13188260,13192060," There are going to be companies that try to shrink because of this type of stuff."
13192060,13193540," They're going to run into some problems."
13193540,13198460," A lot of the things that AI development is currently doing is not like super advanced."
13198460,13200780," And a lot of it still needs a guiding hand from developers."
13200780,13203980," I do think junior positions are going to be the first ones to take a hit."
13203980,13206220," I think that makes sense."
13206220,13209180," But companies will still need senior developers."
13209180,13213620," So yeah, good after it."
13213620,13218660," The recent examples of AMD and Intel GPUs performance gaining over time with driver updates."
13218660,13224020," The lab's going to test to make sure that the driver updates are keeping up with performance."
13224020,13227380," We retest for every review."
13227380,13232620," So yeah, you're going to always be able to trust that the numbers you're looking at from"
13232620,13236060," our latest content is based on the latest drivers."
13236060,13241300," And Linus, how do you handle determining trustability in your employees?"
13241300,13245940," I tend to be, if anything, too trusting."
13245940,13255100," So I rely on processes and managers and HR to kind of monitor people's work and make"
13255100,13257260," sure that they're doing the right things in general."
13257260,13260020," I think we have a really good crew here."
13260020,13263140," Like the App Mark Pippen is missing."
13263140,13264140," Yeah."
13264140,13268340," But it never occurred to me that someone would have stolen it."
13268340,13272460," It's probably a mishap thing."
13272460,13275820," The box was super old and ratty."
13275820,13278540," I think it was probably just a really unfortunate accident."
13278540,13279540," Yeah."
13279540,13283940," Are you going to be doing latency timing for different controllers?"
13283940,13284940," Yeah."
13284940,13290940," Well, it might be kind of challenging for a certain..."
13290940,13292380," We're certainly going to try."
13292380,13293380," Something we'll consider."
13293380,13294380," Yeah."
13294380,13298060," Do you have any plans on labs testing screen protectors?"
13298060,13300740," No, there's no plans for that right now."
13300740,13302460," I think that would..."
13302460,13307500," In order to draw meaningful conclusions, you would have to have sample sizes far greater"
13307500,13309860," than what would be practical for us to test."
13309860,13314740," Are you guys going to be looking at the new Acer 3D screen?"
13314740,13320340," They're using AI magic during 2D content in 23D."
13320340,13326620," The new 3D screens that I've seen that are 4K OLED, every other..."
13326620,13328580," Actually, no, there's ones that aren't OLED too."
13328580,13333660," Anyway, the new glasses list 3D that I've seen is kind of unbelievable."
13333660,13338260," It uses camera eye tracking to know which eye is looking at it from where."
13338260,13341060," And then it's like some kind of shift thing."
13341060,13346540," Anyway, the point is it can account for where it's kind of mind-blowing and it's pretty"
13346540,13347540," cool."
13347540,13349540," Have you traveled with your Steam deck?"
13349540,13353340," If so, do you have a go-to mobile charging solution or other accessories that he can"
13353340,13354820," stuff in his backpack?"
13354820,13356540," Oh, I just purchased."
13356540,13361100," Yeah, I just carry one Type-C charger, the one for my laptop, and then I use it for my"
13361100,13362900," phone, my INEO."
13362900,13368020," Actually, I was using the Ally lately, but yeah, so for my Ally and for my laptop, it's"
13368020,13369580," like freaking awesome."
13369580,13370580," It's nothing special."
13370580,13374260," It's the one that came with my old Flow X 13 laptop."
13374260,13378060," I'm not that picky when it comes to chargers."
13378060,13379340," Any plans for polo shirts?"
13379340,13385220," For those of us nerds who need to wear polos at work, also restock on tablet when?"
13385220,13388900," We have some really exciting work wear coming."
13388900,13394060," We have what we're calling tech pants, where they're really comfortable and they have pockets"
13394060,13397380," and stuff, but they still look professional enough that you could wear them at a workplace"
13397380,13399820," that requires slacks."
13399820,13407180," And then we also just have some basic, very minimal or invisible branding tops that are"
13407180,13408180," going to be very work appropriate."
13408180,13409180," I'm going to interject."
13409180,13411900," I just want to answer this one vocally."
13411900,13417460," Ryan N says, \"What do you think about companies that block chat GPT for fear of leaking proprietary"
13417460,13418460," information?"
13418460,13421260," What would you suggest to ease their fears?\""
13421260,13423420," I cannot ease their fears."
13423420,13424420," I don't know where it went."
13424420,13425420," I can't hide it."
13425420,13427220," If you guys see that one, hide it."
13427220,13429140," I cannot ease their fears."
13429140,13431860," This is a problem that I've been mentioning for a while."
13431860,13435660," OpenAI is super transparent about the fact that they're reading all the responses and"
13435660,13438220," they've already had a leak of information."
13438220,13441300," This is something that people should not really be doing."
13441300,13445700," It's up to your company to decide your security policies."
13445700,13450340," If you put all this proprietary information on something like Google Docs, for instance,"
13450340,13453820," you're sharing it to a certain degree with Google and there are security implications"
13453820,13456180," with that."
13456180,13458660," Does that mean you would trust OpenAI?"
13458660,13461700," That's a decision that you have to make."
13461700,13465700," I do believe, as we've mentioned a couple of times and even talked about on today's show,"
13465700,13471580," that certain companies with certain levels of data security are going to run local offline"
13471580,13475980," versions of these things because of those things."
13475980,13478020," It's not an unfounded fear."
13478020,13480980," I can't dismiss it."
13480980,13482420," This is such a good one."
13482420,13487020," Sebastian L asks, \"Tylinoc, I'm a store manager and an Apple premium reseller and would like"
13487020,13493180," to hear how you would sell Apple products or the brand knowing everything you do.\""
13493180,13495460," Ease of use, build quality."
13495460,13496980," Is it not easy to use?"
13496980,13500780," My mom spent years with Android phones and never really got it."
13500780,13504300," Within a week of having an iPhone, it completely clicked and she totally understood everything"
13504300,13505820," and it worked fine."
13505820,13507180," That, man, I don't know."
13507180,13509180," I have not had the same experience."
13509180,13510180," Yeah, me neither."
13510180,13512460," But for some people, it's a thing."
13512460,13517020," I probably would sell the benefit of, I mean, particularly the iPhone."
13517020,13521100," I don't really think I could sell a Mac very easily, but the iPhone is a pretty obvious"
13521100,13522340," one to me."
13522340,13524300," You just kind of don't have to think about it."
13524300,13527340," It'll work for like six or seven years and then you can get a new one."
13527340,13529180," I would sell the longevity."
13529180,13535660," I think you already did this blockchat GPT thing."
13535660,13537980," Luke, you are a genuine role model."
13537980,13539820," I was trying to answer this through text."
13539820,13540820," I didn't want to..."
13540820,13547060," I teach classes to help incoming cable technicians learn to install network infrastructure."
13547060,13548620," What would it be..."
13548620,13549620," What would I..."
13549620,13552060," It like to see in their installers..."
13552060,13558660," What would IT like to see in their installers to help make things easier?"
13558660,13560540," That's a really broad question."
13560540,13563820," How I was going to answer it is just like a drive and willingness to learn new things"
13563820,13568740," because it's an area that is like pretty much your whole job is maintaining what you have"
13568740,13573500," and also moving it forward with the constant march of technology."
13573500,13578020," If you have someone who's not that interested in learning new things in that position, in"
13578020,13583900," my opinion, unless they're in a space that doesn't evolve, they're not going to do well."
13583900,13585940," You like constantly have to use new stuff."
13585940,13590580," So I know it's not something you can teach them necessarily, but it's a thing."
13590580,13593020," I do not have a 10-year vision, Charles."
13593020,13595140," Dang it, we're going to try."
13595140,13597380," We're going to try to still exist in 10 years."
13597380,13598380," That's the vision."

13717380,13718380," I don't know if it'll exist."
13718380,13720380," I got one that I want to answer verbally."
13720380,13725980," Luke, I'm a BIOS engineer specializing in security on the motherboard that got hacked."
13725980,13729380," For complete security, it's best not to keep the board."
13729380,13732380," Bootkits are becoming more, uh-oh, where to go."
13732380,13736380," Bootkits are becoming more common, namely black lotus."
13736380,13738380," This is the trouble."
13738380,13742060," We had that short go out where we smashed the SSD and there was a bunch of responses being"
13742060,13744140," like, couldn't you have saved it?"
13744140,13745300," Wouldn't have been possible."
13745300,13747380," It is possible it would have been okay."
13747380,13748380," Probably, actually."
13748380,13750220," Probably, very probably."
13750220,13755460," It's also technically possible it wouldn't have and it wasn't worth the risk."
13755460,13757580," So we didn't do it."
13757580,13762860," This is another situation where like, now I'm getting a BIOS engineer telling me to throw"
13762860,13764140," the motherboard."
13764140,13768020," Like the plan right now is to re-sawder the chip, not to throw out the motherboard."
13768020,13770260," I'm pretty certain that is fine."
13770260,13772300," I do not believe we have to throw out the motherboard."
13772300,13776820," I think if we completely replace the chip, it should be okay."
13776820,13777820," It should be."
13777820,13779060," This makes me want to look into it a little more."
13779060,13780820," I'm not aware of any other storage on a motherboard."
13780820,13781820," Me neither."
13781820,13783140," So like it should be fine."
13783140,13786740," What I've been trying to figure out is flashing it fine."
13786740,13787740," No."
13787740,13788740," It's not?"
13788740,13789740," No."
13789740,13790740," You're sure?"
13790740,13791740," Yeah."
13791740,13792740," Okay."
13792740,13793740," Then yeah, I guess we're re-sawdinging the chip because I don't want to throw that board"
13793740,13794740," away."
13794740,13796660," That's too much waste and completely replacing."
13796660,13801420," Yeah, as far as I know, the only form of storage on the board, it should be fine."
13801420,13803780," Like genuinely should be fine."
13803780,13807140," As far as my understanding goes."
13807140,13810140," I have never heard of shift phones."
13810140,13811140," Me neither."
13811140,13812860," Oh, they're headphones."
13812860,13815820," That makes- Oh, no, there's also a phone."
13815820,13816820," Okay."
13816820,13817820," Yep."
13817820,13819340," No idea."
13819340,13821140," Never heard of it."
13821140,13822140," Neat."
13822140,13824500," Thanks, anonymous."
13824500,13828620," Anthony, what resources website and online communities to use to keep up with AI?"
13828620,13831020," I mean, honestly, it's just everywhere I look these days."
13831020,13833020," I don't really have to go out of my way."
13833020,13834020," Luke."
13834020,13835540," It's just you use Luke."
13835540,13836540," Yeah."
13836540,13838540," It is literally everywhere though."
13838540,13839820," Like I don't know."
13839820,13840820," It's all over the place."
13840820,13843180," Hey, thanks, Carrie."
13843180,13848700," Um, uh, Rainier says I could really use a way to redeem all these gift cards."
13848700,13851460," I've been collecting to store credit on my LTT account."
13851460,13852460," Please?"
13852460,13853660," Well, you could buy something."
13853660,13854660," Yeah."
13854660,13855660," What do you mean?"
13855660,13859620," Um, Ashley, huge fan of the WAN show and just wanted to say thanks for adding women's"
13859620,13860980," undergarments to the LTT store."
13860980,13863300," My girlfriend and I have both been waiting to buy a pair."
13863300,13864300," Heck yeah."
13864300,13865300," Nice."
13865300,13869540," I'm really excited for our next his and hers undergarment project."
13869540,13873060," Okay, I'm just going to leak it."
13873060,13877540," Matching strawberry print."
13877540,13879340," The internet wants the gamer socks."
13879340,13881420," Sorry, programming socks."
13881420,13882420," Uh, Steven."
13882420,13884380," Uh, my daughter and I love the show."
13884380,13885380," We're in the UK and every side."
13885380,13886380," Oh, okay."
13886380,13887380," That would be just a show."
13887380,13888380," Yep."
13888380,13889380," Okay."
13889380,13895940," Oh, I'll hail the LTT backpacks as Jonathan D late at night."
13895940,13897860," A car pulled into my lane and immediately stopped."
13897860,13901860," I had to break hard on my backpack with the laptop went flying at my glove box."
13901860,13902860," It survived."
13902860,13904340," Heck yeah."
13904340,13908700," A feature I'd love to see in merch messages being able to."
13908700,13909700," Oh, okay."
13909700,13911860," Just built my first PC with the LTT screwdriver."
13911860,13912860," Heck yeah."
13912860,13916180," What's the one thing you want to sell an LTT store, but isn't practical in some way?"
13916180,13922620," The desk that we've designed these like super cool cable list desks and they're just, they're"
13922620,13926900," too big and impractical for us to figure out how to build and ship right now."
13926900,13929860," Casey says, greatly appreciate your videos and banter."
13929860,13932460," Find myself disappointed in robot lawnmower technology."
13932460,13935420," AI Vision Tech is somewhat here for this possible home video."
13935420,13937100," We actually have one coming."
13937100,13942700," We did a sponsored video with, um, EcoFlow."
13942700,13943700," It's pretty cool."
13943700,13944740," It's coming along."
13944740,13949260," I wouldn't say it's like a no brainer that everyone should just buy one by this at this"
13949260,13952180," point in time, but it's definitely coming along."
13952180,13958580," Um, background playback is definitely something that we are working on, but it's going to"
13958580,13959580," take some time."
13959580,13960580," Oh, wow."
13960580,13961820," People are moving things."
13961820,13962820," Let's move them."
13962820,13964660," Uh, but, but Gianluca."
13964660,13965660," Hi, I'm from Italy."
13965660,13970380," What do you think about the fact that the privacy guarantor, a government entity blocked access"
13970380,13971620," to chat GPT?"
13971620,13973100," Oh, I did not see that."
13973100,13976620," Uh, and I, so I don't have any thoughts on that, but that's kind of wild."
13976620,13981260," Considering short run to gear with custom brand instead of the LTT logo, if people were"
13981260,13986580," willing to pay a premium, I mean, creator warehouse exists in order for us to do that."
13986580,13988100," So you would have to get in touch."
13988100,13991420," And I think we have a site that we're going to launch that sort of talks about those services"
13991420,13992820," more in the future."
13992820,13996260," But yeah, that's absolutely something we would do."
13996260,13998220," MLA tech."
13998220,14001780," Oh, you know what?"
14001780,14007220," The last gen of TVs was so good that I just have not really felt like I've needed to look"
14007220,14008820," that closely at the new gen."
14008820,14014380," I think we have examples coming from Sony, Samsung and LG for a roundup."
14014380,14020500," But it doesn't seem to have been the huge leap forward that the previous gen was."
14020500,14022900," Okay."
14022900,14025460," And I think that is pretty much."
14025460,14027300," Oh, no, this is interesting."
14027300,14028300," Okay."
14028300,14029300," Last one."
14029300,14031620," \"Manage to catch live show.\""
14031620,14032620," Whoop."
14032620,14033620," You have a wealth of not?"
14033620,14034620," Okay."
14034620,14035620," Yeah."
14035620,14040540," Have you ever considered seed funding or mentoring smaller tech space creators?"
14040540,14042820," I don't know what that even looked like."
14042820,14052260," Like, I don't want to, I don't want to make them like, what's a, what's a, what's a,"
14052260,14053260," what's a word like?"
14053260,14056500," I don't want them to be feel like they owe us something, right?"
14056500,14061540," Like we've definitely, we're, we've got LTX coming up where it's a chance for people"
14061540,14063620," to kind of get together and collab and network."
14063620,14065540," That's something I guess we're doing."
14065540,14069780," We're paying, we're paying airfare and hotel for a lot of creators to, to come and kind"
14069780,14070780," of meet up."
14070780,14071780," Obviously there's a benefit to us."
14071780,14073940," It makes our event cooler for the community as well."
14073940,14076420," But like, I don't know."
14076420,14078740," I think the best thing we can do is just be an open book."
14078740,14081780," Like I've got a lot of feedback that our videos about how we make money have really helped"
14081780,14083300," guide smaller creators."
14083300,14084300," Yeah."
14084300,14092580," There's a, I'm still kind of learning like 100% what it is."
14092580,14101420," But there's a student run thing for Harvard and MIT students called prod."
14101420,14108420," It's a student run nonprofit that's like somewhat of a startup incubator for MIT and"
14108420,14110260," Harvard students."
14110260,14115460," And I'm helping doing mentor stuff with them."
14115460,14116460," So yes."
14116460,14120380," And I think that's it."
14120380,14121380," Thank you for tuning in."
14121380,14122380," We'll see you again next week."
14122380,14123380," Same bad time."
14123380,14124380," Same bad channel."
14124380,14125380," Bye."
14125380,14126380," Hm, the duration's 420."
