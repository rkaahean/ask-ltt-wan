0,3840," Welcome to the WAN show everyone."
3840,7880," The truth is, I screwed up this week."
7880,12780," It's very obvious that, I mean, I just couldn't conceal it anymore."
12780,17680," We were paid by NVIDIA for our RTX 4060 TI review."
17680,23800," And the scariest part of what I just said is that a not insignificant number of people"
23800,29560," are going to take that at face value, not watch any more of the video, and believe it"
29560,31960," for the rest of their days."
31960,36160," Let's talk about how confusing people found our review of the 4060 TI."
36160,41160," We're also going to be talking to you guys about how confusing I'm finding Sony's new"
41160,43640," handheld accessory."
43640,48280," It's a Wi-Fi based PlayStation 5 streaming thing."
48280,51080," Did they learn nothing from the Nintendo Wii U?"
51080,52680," What else we got going on this week?"
52680,57280," It does seem like the Wii U was just like actually too early at this point."
57280,58280," It's starting to feel that way."
58280,60520," It really feels like it."
60520,61520," Wow."
61520,63200," Invisible PC set up."
63200,64400," This was actually super cool."
64400,65400," Did you see this?"
65400,66400," I read the comments."
66400,67400," Oh, great."
67400,70320," We'll talk about it later because you'll probably need to see it if you want to talk"
70320,71560," about it more specifically."
71560,72560," But who knows?"
72560,73560," Maybe."
73560,74560," We'll see."
74560,81280," The National Eating Disorders Association replaced a helpline with a chatbot because clearly"
81280,85640," no one there has watched the WAN show."
85640,106000," Oh."
106000,111120," The show is brought to you today by Vessi, Signal Wire and Corsair."
111120,112360," All right."
112360,115480," We're going to jump right over to my laptop here."
115480,121440," And this is one of those things where, Luke, I feel like we need to open the conversation"
121440,123680," back up."
123680,126240," Open it back up about shadow banning companies."
126240,129040," Shadow banning people do it because just do it."
129040,135880," I actually found the comments section of this video extremely difficult to handle."
135880,138520," Let's see."
138520,139920," Some people get it."
139920,142120," Please keep calling out this nonsense."
142120,146120," This was an extremely negative review."
146120,149720," It started with, oh, thank you, NVIDIA."
149720,153160," At least you didn't downgrade this graphics card."
153160,160840," I literally, literally said something actually positive after some negative things."
160840,169720," And then I said, okay, that last one wasn't sarcastic because I am aware that a not insignificant"
169720,174560," portion of our audience does have a little bit of trouble picking up on sarcasm, whether"
174560,178520," it's like a social cue challenge thing or whether it's the fact that English isn't their"
178520,179520," second language."
179520,180840," English is a really weird language."
180840,183040," Rather is their second language."
183040,188040," So I made it actually explicit."
188040,196520," And the number of comments that are just, let me see if I can, let me see if I can, let"
196520,199600," me see if I can find this."
199600,201920," Oh, man."
201920,203600," This is, see, this is frustrating because-"
203600,204600," This is like, you need them."
204600,205600," They're not there."
205600,206600," Yeah."
206600,207600," The second one I need it."
207600,208600," Yeah."
208600,209600," It's, it's not there."
209600,211880," That's just, that's just how like presenting things on stage or on camera."
211880,213120," It's just how it's just how it works."
213120,214120," Okay."
214120,215120," Where's my phone?"
215120,218760," Because I sent you one on Discord that was just absolutely mind blowing."
218760,220960," The point is not to call it any specific user."
220960,221960," Don't go looking for this."
221960,224480," But we've got a couple of comments in a row here."
224480,227280," Like, why can't you just say it's a bad deal?"
227280,231080," You're not crapping on Nvidia makes it look like you're caping for Nvidia."
231080,233760," Not saying you are, but that's what it looks like."
233760,236760," This review also feels short and unrigorous."
236760,238960," This is a rare thumbs down for me."
238960,247840," We had probably more game benchmarking than just, than we've ever had before."
247840,249000," Extremely rigorous."
249000,251280," The whole thing is automated now."
251280,252320," All of our testing."
252320,253840," This is something to note."
253840,259040," All of our testing was fresh on the latest drivers for every one of those cards."
259040,263080," That is extremely unusual, but it's also extremely important."
263080,267720," I mean, you can include numbers from three months ago or six months ago, but as we've"
267720,273600," seen, especially with Intel Arc and especially when AMD launches anything within a span of"
273600,280760," two, three, six months, you might as well just, you might as well just say, I hate AMD"
280760,283080," and don't feel like showing them in a fair light."
283080,287920," You might as well just say that because if you're not including fresh numbers, that's"
287920,289160," not valid."
289160,290440," It's just actually useless."
290440,294000," You might as well just kind of go, you might as well approximate."
294000,296960," Well, I didn't have the Xt, so I don't know."
296960,301080," It has 10% more cu's, so I bumped the clock speed 10%."
301080,302480," This is an approximation."
302480,303480," And you know what?"
303480,310400," It would probably be reasonably close, but it's disingenuous to label the chart in 6700"
310400,314480," Xt or whatever it is, this next one."
314480,316120," Thank you."
316120,319320," I haven't been watching LTT, and now I remember why."
319320,323760," The only reason I clicked was I was hoping the title was sarcasm, but weird how he kept"
323760,327920," looking for positive things to say when the card is straight up garbage, trying to stay"
327920,329560," in Nvidia's good books."
329560,336720," I haven't been in Nvidia's good books for like a couple years now."
336720,338160," That's not how this works."
338160,341040," That's not how any of this works."
341040,346880," The reason that we're looking for positive things to say is because our reviews are designed"
346880,353440," to be everything you need to know about the card and the price, the price is fluid, right?"
353440,358040," So if you come back to this video in a couple years and you want to know what features does"
358040,364080," it have, how does it compare to the cards that are similar around it?"
364080,368800," Honestly, one of the things the labs did a great job of this time was including older"
368800,370120," cards."
370120,376120," The number of positive comments we got from people saying, \"Wow, thank you so much for"
376120,379520," putting a couple of older cards on the graph for a change."
379520,385400," Now I have some idea how this compares when I'm looking for an upgrade was really awesome."
385400,389920," I just want to give a huge shout out to the writers, huge shout out to the lab."
389920,397120," I'm actually really, really proud of our 4060 Ti review and our RX7600 review."
397120,398360," There are a couple of things we got wrong."
398360,403120," I think we had a table in the 4060 Ti review that said it had a 16x interface."
403120,404960," It has an 8x interface."
404960,408280," That is a problem if you're upgrading an older platform."
408280,410240," On a modern platform, it's not a problem."
410240,415200," It doesn't affect the numbers that we showed you guys, but that is something that we could"
415200,416200," have gotten a little bit better."
416200,418320," I think there were a couple small things in the 7600."
418320,424480," But every time we release a new GPU review, we're getting a little bit cleaner about it."
424480,427760," That's a lot of moving parts, guys."
427760,432840," But this is one of those things that I'm just looking at going, \"Give me a reason not to"
432840,434960," start shadow banning again.\""
434960,437400," This is another one that I saw on today's video."
437400,442440," It was a short on the Billy Billy Gold Play button that we got for reaching a million subscribers"
442440,443880," on Billy Billy."
443880,448200," Which is super awesome, huge shout out."
448200,451720," Dennis has been deeply involved in that over the years."
451720,456360," He's been involved in that over the years and helped foster the community over there."
456360,462400," Our translation team over in China, all the members, past and present, just shout out all"
462400,466800," those people for making this possible."
466800,469640," This is the takeaway that someone got."
469640,473840," Was not expecting Linus to take a knee to China after saying he will never visit because"
473840,474840," of the CCP."
474840,478280," What a hypocrite."
478280,479280," Here's something."
479280,483520," It actually costs us money to run that Chinese channel."
483520,488760," Because I won't go to China anymore, I have no way of getting any of the ad revenue that"
488760,492120," we've made from that channel out of China."
492120,493480," It's all just stuck there."
493480,499080," It's just something where there was a fan group that was translating our videos, pirating"
499080,500800," them, uploading them to Billy Billy."
500800,504120," We went, \"Hey, please don't do that."
504120,505280," But how about this?"
505280,509920," How about we actually compensate you for it and we'll make the whole thing official and"
509920,515520," that way we can have a proper presence there with translations and all that good stuff.\""
515520,519040," If it's going to get pirated anyways, we might as well do it properly."
519040,521040," We might as well do it properly."
521040,525720," It's just one of those things that I look at and I go, \"Why do I have to read that?"
525720,528520," Why do I ever, whether you're trolling?\""
528520,530640," Which honestly, I don't think so."
530640,533200," I've got a pretty good radar for it these days."
533200,536920," No, some people actually are that brain dead."
536920,543440," Whether you're trolling, if you are, or whether your takes are just that bad."
543440,546120," I used to care about this a lot."
546120,547120," Like shadow banning?"
547120,548120," Yeah."
548120,549120," Like thinking it was a bad thing."
549120,550120," Yeah."
550120,551120," Then what happened?"
551120,552120," Is it just because I send you these?"
552120,553520," Not even sort of anymore."
553520,556520," I'm actually completely on the other side now."
556520,559280," This might piss some people off, but it's just the reality."
559280,565000," In my opinion, back when I was a stalwart defender of like, \"You shouldn't ban people,\""
565000,568640," the internet was in a bit of a different spot."
568640,576640," And now like, I don't know, you get how many comments every day and it's like, \"Yeah,"
576640,578640," I don't know."
578640,580440," Is that helping anything?\""
580440,581440," Yeah."
581440,585440," Like actually at all, is this beneficial for anything?"
585440,586960," Are you going to change anything?"
586960,589480," Is this any discourse coming from this that is helpful?"
589480,590480," Yeah."
590480,591480," So I've been scrolling."
591480,592480," Here's another one."
592480,593480," This review was way too lenient."
593480,596400," This card is garbage, end of story."
596400,597400," It's not garbage."
597400,600400," That's just, I don't know what to tell you."
600400,601400," It's not garbage."
601400,611560," I feel like people have gotten kind of a twisted, like a twisted perception of what garbage"
611560,613080," is."
613080,614360," At the right price."
614360,621280," Does it, do you plug it into your computer and does it shart FPS onto your monitor?"
621280,626520," Does it do so without overheating, without causing blue screens?"
626520,628320," Does it harm your dog?"
628320,630920," You know, like, is it bad?"
630920,632560," No."
632560,633560," It's overpriced."
633560,634560," It's not worth it."
634560,635560," That's its problem."
635560,636560," Yeah."
636560,641640," NVIDIA is marketing a 50 series card as a 60 Ti card."
641640,642640," And that's a problem."
642640,643640," And pricing it as such."
643640,645800," And that's a problem."
645800,648220," But it doesn't make it garbage."
648220,650680," It makes it overpriced."
650680,654200," Like if you found it and it was that card and it was on a mad discount."
654200,655200," Yeah."
655200,656200," Maybe it's all right."
656200,657680," Absolutely."
657680,659080," And happy 45, 30 first."
659080,661120," There's no criticism allowed on LTT videos, I guess."
661120,662600," Say anything bad, they shadow bend you."
662600,664760," Let's say that's not true at all."
664760,665760," We have no problem."
665760,666760," That is not a point."
666760,669000," We have no problem with constructive criticism."
669000,670920," What it is is I just, I don't know."
670920,675320," It's continuous arguments, trying to start things just for the sake of trying to start"
675320,677520," things like, I don't know."
677520,678520," Yeah."
678520,680680," I just can't."
680680,683200," Oh, man."
683200,688520," We've actually got a video coming where I kind of lean into this."
688520,690920," I was having some fun with it."
690920,694240," I kind of brought back the scrapyard war spirit though."
694240,698880," So everyone's getting kind of mad at me for not going hard enough on NVIDIA."
698880,699880," And I shouldn't say everyone."
699880,701240," I like dislike ratio on that video."
701240,704200," It's still about 92%, 93% or something like that."
704200,705560," It might even be higher now."
705560,710120," Because it tends to be that it's that initial rush of people, like the really hardcore tech"
710120,714320," people that are like, this review wasn't critical enough or whatever the case may be."
714320,718600," But the number of people that are mad at me for not going hard enough at NVIDIA is if"
718600,722680," I have any kind of influence whatsoever on NVIDIA."
722680,724600," It's just comical to me at this point."
724600,731080," So I wrote up a little intro because I wanted to address that, right?"
731080,735720," So it kind of goes along the lines of like, are you tired of GPU manufacturers screwing"
735720,737240," over your wallet?"
737240,740200," Well, it's time to take action here."
740200,744040," Let me show you what to do and kind of do a little flourish with my wallet and put it"
744040,745160," in my pocket."
745160,749160," And then do you remember the Windows 3.1 sound that's like, dah, dah."
749160,752200," I did it."
752200,753200," I didn't open it."
753200,759840," And I worked with Nicole from the editing team to there's this really cool transition that"
759840,765960," we can do where if you do a whip pan and then a whip pan back, you can use two completely"
765960,771080," different shots as long as that blur is of approximately the same things."
771080,778600," So it actually whips away from me to me standing in the studio and I'm like, your performative"
778600,780480," boycott means nothing."
780480,787320," You have more than enough GPUs for like, I basically get to be my own like peanut gallery."
787320,790600," Your performative boycott means nothing blah blah."
790600,799800," Anyway, and then it like whips back to me and it was a really fun video because I basically"
799800,805960," went scrapyard worth shopping and showed that you can get a sick system upgrade for a great"
805960,806960," price right now."
806960,807960," Is it getting better?"
807960,809680," And not given video or AMD any money."
809680,820560," In fact, I had so much fun that I'm kind of thinking we might have to bring it back."
820560,821560," No way."
821560,823120," I think we might have to."
823120,824120," No way."
824120,825120," It was so fun."
825120,827360," Man, I were back boys."
827360,831840," I basically said, I said a budget for myself."
831840,833400," All right."
833400,840960," I set a budget for myself of approximately the price of 46 D.I."
840960,846840," I managed to beat it by about 30% while still saving like 20 bucks."
846840,848920," Oh, performance beat it by 30."
848920,849920," Oh, yeah."
849920,850920," And save 20."
850920,851920," Oh, yeah."
851920,852920," Scary on Mars."
852920,853920," Oh, that's the best."
853920,857920," And I have almost a year of warranty on the card I got."
857920,858920," Damn."
858920,859920," Okay."
859920,862720," What could go wrong?"
862720,863720," Sick."
863720,865440," I won and won and won some more."
865440,867720," And I got a video out of it, which is winning four times."
867720,868720," That's a win."
868720,870240," Yeah, exactly."
870240,873760," And so I'm looking at it going like, oh, yeah."
873760,875240," We got another comment over here on the 40."
875240,877600," You must have been paid to review this card."
877600,884760," People like that clearly have no idea what it's like to work with a brand on a paid promotion."
884760,885760," You do."
885760,886760," Yeah."
886760,888920," Would you be allowed to open with a sarcastic?"
888920,889920," No."
889920,891680," Oh, thank you, Nvidia."
891680,894720," Or at least not taking away any VRAM."
894720,897360," No, not even sort of."
897360,898360," You sure?"
898360,899360," Yeah."
899360,900360," Are you sure?"
900360,901360," Dude, we have."
901360,902360," Because it seems like you would be able to."
902360,904040," Based on some of the comments."
904040,905040," Yeah."
905040,906040," I wonder how much you're not right."
906040,909040," We have stuff kicked back for like a lot less than that."
909040,910240," This is great."
910240,912080," Ah, hold on."
912080,913080," Hold on."
913080,914080," Where did it go?"
914080,915480," Must have been must have been paid."
915480,916480," Super cool."
916480,917480," Excellent."
917480,918480," Smart comment."
918480,919480," I wonder how much they paid."
919480,923720," This video doesn't feel so honest, but I get it from a business perspective."
923720,924720," No."
924720,927800," You actually don't."
927800,928800," You get nothing."
928800,930120," You're not on our side."
930120,932120," You missed the whole thing."
932120,935520," Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh."
935520,937880," I don't know."
937880,942040," I just anyway, massive, massive shout out to the team."
942040,943640," Really, really happy with those reviews."
943640,946200," Really excited for the direction the lab is going."
946200,950520," We've had some really cool and exciting meetings lately with the team over there."
950520,955320," I think we're going to be ready to roll out some of the category specific channels."
955320,958120," Because I think I've talked about this on the WAN show before."
958120,967000," But one of the directions that I see online content going is I see mega channels like the"
967000,974000," MKBHDs and LTTs actually even to a lesser degree, Marquez, because he is kind of niche"
974000,975000," focused."
975000,981400," Especially now that he's split cars off of MKBHD onto autofocus."
981400,987920," It's kind of mobile devices and consumer electronics."
987920,990240," So it's relatively narrowly focused, right?"
990240,991560," Compared to ours."
991560,995120," Whereas we are as broad as, okay, this week."
995120,998480," Is this thing powered by something?"
998480,1008720," This week we uploaded a tour of ASML who makes the lithography machines that help manufacturers"
1008720,1014920," like Intel and TSMC produce the world's most cutting edge microchips."
1014920,1018400," So like super, super deep technical video."
1018400,1025560," And then we also built a silly $100,000 computer for playing Minecraft and water cool to bed."
1025560,1030800," I basically did a YouTuber video where I talked about, you know, what's going on in my personal"
1030800,1032480," life and my job role changed."
1032480,1034920," Like we are all over the map."
1034920,1037400," Reviews of a couple GPUs."
1037400,1042320," So the way that I see it, it's going to be much, much harder to attract a loyal audience"
1042320,1047840," to a channel and therefore build a loyal audience for a channel unless you're focused."
1047840,1051600," And the way that I see it, if you have a power supply focus channel, you're going to get"
1051600,1052840," two different viewers for that."
1052840,1058000," You're going to get people who really want to stay up on what's going on in power supplies."
1058000,1063440," And then you're going to get people who haven't cared about a power supply in six years, but"
1063440,1069760," they're building a new computer and they're going, sorry, 16 pin what?"
1069760,1073240," What's, I don't care, just tell me a good one, right?"
1073240,1074920," So you're going to get a lot of those."
1074920,1081760," Our goal, our goal for a power supply specific channel will be, and you guys can quote me"
1081760,1086760," on this, to have a video for every power supply."
1086760,1091160," Like every new one that comes out?"
1091160,1099480," Well, we're going to have to work on some back catalog to know, no, like, ATX, ATX"
1099480,1101080," money and doing server ones."
1101080,1105320," There could, but I mean, almost nobody builds a server anymore."
1105320,1106200," Oh, yeah, fair enough."
1106200,1108200," It's almost exclusively bare bones."
1108200,1115880," And I could see us having a more enterprise IT sort of focus channel at some point where"
1115880,1120760," we would look at bare bones servers and look at these platforms as a whole."
1120760,1124000," But that would be something that would come later and it would be more along the lines"
1124000,1127720," of how we would test something like laptops, laptops."
1127720,1134240," Oh, man, laptops are deep to cover a laptop properly."
1134240,1140320," You have to have your methodologies down for everything, battery testing, screen testing,"
1140320,1143320," keyboard testing, processor testing."
1143320,1148280," Oh, don't forget that you're going to have to account for different environmental factors."
1148280,1151880," Don't forget that you need to test it in different power profiles depending on whether"
1151880,1154280," it's plugged in or unplugged."
1154280,1155520," Laptops are going to take some time."
1155520,1156680," Oh, yeah, right."
1156680,1161640," And don't forget that per model, per chassis, they're available in, I don't know, about"
1161640,1166760," 25 different configurations."
1166760,1172160," Do you remember when I optimistically bought one of every config of the M1 MacBook thinking,"
1172160,1177480," okay, we're going to get like our laptop methodology down and we're going to be the"
1177480,1183480," outlet that actually can tell you exactly which configuration to buy, like bang for"
1183480,1184480," the buck."
1184480,1187800," And then they basically all got deployed to people who wanted MacBooks internally and"
1187800,1189360," scattered to the high winds."
1189360,1191600," Yeah, that was a good investment."
1191600,1199600," Anywho, the idea is that eventually we're going to get there and then all the ones that we"
1199600,1200800," don't need anymore."
1200800,1205600," We'll just divest ourselves of by flipping them at LTT store, not com or an eBay or whatever."
1205600,1207400," We'll figure all that out."
1207400,1211680," It's time for us to jump into our next topic here."
1211680,1215040," Apparently, Dan is not going to let me talk about haters anymore."
1215040,1218160," Do you want, can we talk about this, the Sony thing?"
1218160,1225840," Yeah, Sony PS5 announcements at their PlayStation showcase, Sony announced their new handheld"
1225840,1230840," projected to come out later this year called Project Q. The handheld allows remote play"
1230840,1235520," of PS5 games via Wi-Fi at up to 1080p and 60fps."
1235520,1237320," It has an eight inch LCD screen."
1237320,1241840," We have no idea how much it will cost and it's unclear whether it will do anything else"
1241840,1246680," other than stream PS5 games or whether it will be able to use cellular networks, considering"
1246680,1248000," they specified Wi-Fi."
1248000,1250120," I doubt it, but we'll see."
1250120,1254040," Yeah, that's one of those things where the answer is no."
1254040,1255040," Yeah."
1255040,1259400," Also, lossless wireless earbuds."
1259400,1262720," The PlayStation showcase also highlighted a number of upcoming games."
1262720,1268240," Sony announced/showed off several standard PS5 games, the only notable exclusive being"
1268240,1271120," Spider-Man 2."
1271120,1277320," Some notable not exclusives, a remake of Metal Gear 3, a reboot of Bungie's Marathon series."
1277320,1278320," That's..."
1278320,1279320," I know, right?"
1279320,1282960," Sony owning Bungie just makes my brain hurt."
1282960,1286720," Yeah, but it's not exclusive."
1286720,1290280," The whole thing is just weird, but maybe really cool."
1290280,1294440," I haven't been able to look into any of that yet because I had a very busy week, but I'm"
1294440,1297800," pretty interested in the idea of them rebooting Marathon."
1297800,1298800," We'll see."
1298800,1305440," Alan Wake 2, a Splatoon alike called Foamstars, and the one Riley is most excited about, the"
1305440,1306920," Talos Principle 2."
1306920,1309400," I think quite a few people are going to be excited about that."
1309400,1312240," It's a PvP extraction shooter."
1312240,1316720," Oh, I think you've got his attention."
1316720,1322080," Oh my, Bungie making a PvP extraction shooter is extremely exciting."
1322080,1323080," Like the Division."
1323080,1325800," Okay, that part makes it a lot worse."
1325800,1328720," Okay, hopefully it's not like the Division at all."
1328720,1332960," The Division was terrible, in my opinion, but I'm sure someone liked it."
1332960,1337680," Okay, I want to talk about this wireless console thing."
1337680,1340000," Is it just me or..."
1340000,1342960," Like very little use for this?"
1342960,1346480," Why don't you just play on your TV?"
1346480,1348040," I don't know how to feel about this."
1348040,1350640," Okay, so first of all, here, let's flip over to my laptop."
1350640,1353720," This is apparently what it's going to look like."
1353720,1355520," I think it looks cool."
1355520,1356920," Yeah, it looks really cool."
1356920,1359720," It actually looks like it's probably comfortable to hold and stuff too."
1359720,1360880," Here's my problem."
1360880,1365840," I don't know how to feel about this because I've been kind of all over the place."
1365840,1366840," Yeah."
1366840,1369320," I loved the Nvidia Shield."
1369320,1370320," Yes."
1370320,1375520," And yes, Android games did exist that could be played with a controller, but at the time,"
1375520,1377400," they were way less common."
1377400,1384800," So it was fundamentally only a device for streaming your gaming PC to a handheld form"
1384800,1385800," factor."
1385800,1388520," And I was crazy in love with that thing."
1388520,1394320," It was how I played games when I had infant children because you basically had the kid"
1394320,1397320," kind of in the thing in your arms and you could play video games."
1397320,1398920," There was no way you could sit at a computer."
1398920,1399920," So that was it."
1399920,1401600," That was how I could play video games."
1401600,1402840," Loved that."
1402840,1409280," And then I was less bullish on the Steam link, which is basically the same idea except that"
1409280,1414840," it allows you to play your gaming PC games on your TV with a Steam controller or some"
1414840,1416760," other controller or whatever else."
1416760,1420520," And then I'm trying to think of kind of what came next here."
1420520,1424360," I never really used the Nvidia Shield console for that for that function."
1424360,1427200," It just didn't really appeal to me."
1427200,1433080," And then when Logitech, okay, when Logitech announced the G Cloud, I was looking at it"
1433080,1438240," going, well, this is just kind of stupid because you could get a Steam deck for like"
1438240,1441960," a hundred dollars more that actually has a full computer in it."
1441960,1448320," But then I reviewed the G Cloud and even though I was a certified hater of the thing, I actually"
1448320,1449320," really liked it."
1449320,1450920," Like, I really liked it."
1450920,1453040," I've got nothing against the concept of this."
1453040,1456000," I'm a little bit concerned about what I expect the price might be."
1456000,1457480," Well, then there's the Wii U."
1457480,1461120," Did you ever use the wireless controller pad function of the Wii U?"
1461120,1463000," Did you ever even look at that screen?"
1463000,1464000," Yeah."
1464000,1465000," Really."
1465000,1469600," I am a rare Pikachu Wii U enjoyer."
1469600,1471400," I really liked the Wii U."
1471400,1474360," I was, I actually genuinely very much liked the Wii U."
1474360,1475360," We found one."
1475360,1476360," We loved."
1476360,1477360," Okay."
1477360,1481840," So the Super Mario Bros, whatever it was that came out for the Wii U."
1481840,1483360," New Super Mario Bros Wii U."
1483360,1485520," It had a four player co-op feature."
1485520,1486520," Yes, it did."
1486520,1494680," With a fifth person that used that main controller, had their own screen, and you could put down"
1494680,1497120," like emergency platforms for your teammates."
1497120,1501240," You could also troll them by while they're like mid jump, put a platform right in front"
1501240,1503000," of them, and they smack into it and fall down."
1503000,1506280," You could like try to fight your own team from actually completing the level and all"
1506280,1507640," this kind of stuff."
1507640,1509640," Extremely fun."
1509640,1510640," That's very fun."
1510640,1513240," That's very unique experience too."
1513240,1514240," That's fair."
1514240,1515240," And very fun."
1515240,1517360," I played a bunch of different games on the Wii U. They're all really good."
1517360,1522280," I am deeply convinced that the only reason why the Wii U didn't do well was because no"
1522280,1528160," one knew that A, it existed or B, what the hell it even was."
1528160,1531960," My group of relatively techy friends, when I first bought it, I invited them all over"
1531960,1537380," because I wanted to play the five person Super Mario Bros thing or yeah, Super Mario"
1537380,1538380," Bros."
1538380,1539380," Yeah."
1539380,1545520," All of them, literally all of them thought that I bought some expansion for my Wii."
1545520,1547160," None of them knew that it was a dedicated console."
1547160,1548160," Swedish made."
1548160,1549960," What did I say?"
1549960,1551360," Did I say something wrong?"
1551360,1553600," No, no, you just an expansion for your Wii."
1553600,1556880," I'm asking you if it's Swedish made."
1556880,1560200," But yeah, I don't know."
1560200,1563040," I really enjoyed the Wii U. And that controller won."
1563040,1564040," That's sort of fair."
1564040,1565040," That's sort of fair."
1565040,1566280," It is his bag, baby."
1566280,1573400," That controller was actually very comfortable."
1573400,1574400," That's true."
1574400,1575400," Yeah."
1575400,1576400," Yep, it's true."
1576400,1578800," Like more comfortable than the Switch is by a lot, in my opinion."
1578800,1579800," Okay."
1579800,1585200," I do want to keep talking about this paradigm though, because I had another opportunity to"
1585200,1592280," look at a device that's basically this and I have to confess, I kind of blew them off"
1592280,1596160," because I just didn't really care."
1596160,1600440," So you always expect it to suck and then it's actually okay?"
1600440,1604200," Well, no, it's not that because I was so jazzed on the shield, right?"
1604200,1605200," So here, hold on a second."
1605200,1608040," I'm just going to jump back over to my laptop for a second here."
1608040,1610920," This is from PeakDow of all people."
1610920,1617840," Remember these guys, they had this low latency HDMI streaming thing."
1617840,1623520," So it's millimeter wave, which is a problem because that means the range is going to be"
1623520,1628240," pretty fubar, but 1080 60p, so 60 Hertz."
1628240,1636720," And the pitched sort of use case for this thing was actually streaming your PlayStation"
1636720,1641640," 5 to it compatible with PC, PlayStation, Xbox, Windows, Switch, etc."
1641640,1647960," 2.5 milliseconds delay up to 30 meters or whatever and three hour battery life."
1647960,1653040," And I kind of looked at this and I went."
1653040,1656760," That seems really niche."
1656760,1664560," And Sony just laid down a big fat, I think you're wrong, Linus."
1664560,1672920," Because they are releasing a first party accessory that's just this."
1672920,1675720," If this thing could work over cell networks, it would be sick."
1675720,1676720," It doesn't."
1676720,1677720," I know it doesn't."
1677720,1681120," You don't want see people keep asking for this."
1681120,1683560," You don't want to game over a cellular network."
1683560,1684720," Yeah, fair enough."
1684720,1685720," Yeah."
1685720,1689360," And I know I know I hear you."
1689360,1690360," Someone be."
1690360,1695920," You really hear your keys heating up as you furiously type a message about how much you"
1695920,1700440," love using moonlight over a cell network or whatever."
1700440,1702000," Steam link."
1702000,1705320," I know there are certain types of games."
1705320,1708160," You want to play like a puzzle game or something."
1708160,1709160," No problem."
1709160,1711800," By all means play over a cellular network."
1711800,1716280," But wherever you live, a your cell network must be a lot better than mine."
1716280,1721280," So maybe you're in like Tokyo or you're in like Seoul or something like that."
1721280,1722560," Sure, fine."
1722560,1725200," A, your cell network is a lot better than mine."
1725200,1729200," B, you must have a really great data plan."
1729200,1731800," Both of those things are true in a lot of ways in the world."
1731800,1732800," Absolutely."
1732800,1734480," People run their house internets off cell."
1734480,1735480," Absolutely."
1735480,1740000," However, even under those ideal conditions, there are certain genres of games that are"
1740000,1743840," just not going to be fun with the additional latency."
1743840,1747520," And I just I wouldn't I wouldn't compromise on that."
1747520,1749520," I just wouldn't."
1749520,1752480," I love what Sony is doing right now though."
1752480,1754880," PSVR 2 is awesome."
1754880,1755880," Yeah."
1755880,1756880," This."
1756880,1758240," I don't know if it's awesome."
1758240,1759240," It looks cool."
1759240,1760240," But it's cool."
1760240,1761240," Yeah."
1761240,1762240," It's different."
1762240,1763240," Yeah."
1763240,1764240," It's not just."
1764240,1765240," I am a hundred percent certain."
1765240,1766240," Well, it's not necessarily for me."
1766240,1767400," That's some people will love this thing."
1767400,1769920," Like Microsoft."
1769920,1774120," How hard have they lost this generation of gaming at this point?"
1774120,1775120," You."
1775120,1777720," You could play PlayStation games in the bath."
1777720,1778720," Yeah."
1778720,1779720," I could."
1779720,1781040," That's pretty sweet."
1781040,1782040," I won't."
1782040,1783040," But I could."
1783040,1784040," Yeah."
1784040,1785040," Because not necessarily 100 percent for you."
1785040,1787920," But someone could fit that use case."
1787920,1788920," That's pretty cool."
1788920,1794360," I do I do wonder and Conrad's echoing this in the in the chat."
1794360,1798280," How much is it going to cost them not announcing a price is like a little sus."
1799280,1803720," It is it is a it is a wee wee bit sus."
1803720,1806280," I think it's not I think it's not going to be cheap."
1806280,1810960," I mean here here you know what I can get you pricing for that peak dough thing because"
1810960,1815400," realistically it's the same same hardware."
1815400,1819200," You know what I don't know if I ever got a final price because I think it was a kickstarter"
1819200,1822120," or something right that was one of the other reasons that we didn't cover it."
1822120,1827440," I don't like covering kick starters speaking of which we should talk about that sponsor"
1827440,1829800," spot fail this week on tech wiki."
1829800,1831520," I'll we'll address that a little bit later."
1831520,1832880," Don't let me forget."
1832880,1836080," No, I don't have I don't have a price for this thing."
1836080,1839800," So if I had to guess I'd say I'll probably be similar to the G cloud."
1839800,1844760," So in the two fifty two fifty us to two ninety nine I think this is going to be a very expensive"
1844760,1845760," accessory."
1845760,1847800," But again I do think some people eat that."
1847800,1853800," But that's something that Sony has demonstrated that they're totally willing to do."
1853800,1858320," I mean the PlayStation VR 2 is an accessory that costs as much as the bloody console."
1858320,1859320," Yeah."
1859320,1866040," Like it's not that's not cheap by any means at all."
1866040,1872440," But like it's not it's not 700 bucks because it's not dedicated handheld."
1872440,1877160," Yeah, you're not you're not buying a you're not you're not buying an accessory."
1877160,1880400," You're buying a completely different experience."
1880400,1885900," Yeah, and yeah, that's something that Sony has done a really good job of here is creating"
1885900,1887600," different experiences."
1887600,1890920," And it's not going to have quite the mobility of the switch."
1890920,1898760," But man, I got to got to take a moment and just appreciate how crap the switch is these"
1898760,1900080," days."
1900080,1903520," I own a switch OLED a top of the line."
1903520,1906440," It's old now switch if you will."
1906440,1913560," And I own tears of the kingdom you guys saw my copy that I bought on the short circuit."
1913560,1920640," And I am currently in the process of getting my my Yuzu all set up for the trip that Luke"
1920640,1925040," and I are going on so that I can start tears of the kingdom on a platform that doesn't"
1925040,1926040," suck."
1926040,1928760," Yeah, the switch is over six years old."
1928760,1930920," Yeah, and it was garbage when it came out."
1930920,1931920," That's the worst part."
1931920,1937280," By the way, Jake Jake from the lab is talking in the float plane chat about what I said"
1937280,1940440," about cellular networks and game streaming."
1940440,1944280," And he's like, yeah, the problem is not how many gigabits per second or whatever you can"
1944280,1945680," get in a speed test."
1945680,1949360," The problem is that this is real time data and latency matters."
1949360,1953800," And so if anything arrives, even ever so slightly out of order, it's going to be garbled."
1953800,1957640," And that's something you simply can't control on a cellular network."
1957640,1961440," It's extremely challenging."
1961440,1965400," Yeah, yeah, people are talking about like what what ping time I get or how many megabits"
1965400,1967960," I get that that is not the point."
1967960,1971560," It's just a very, very even though it feels the same to us."
1971560,1972920," It's the same thing with frame times."
1972920,1975600," Yeah, I click link and page load."
1975600,1980000," It feels the same to us, but it's a really different technology."
1980000,1983400," Yeah, all right."
1983400,1986200," It's time for us to explain merch messages."
1986200,1990520," If you want to send a message into the show, the way to do it is with the merch message."
1990520,1997320," Look, G or G just scored an insulated water bottle, 64 ounce at LTT store.com."
1997320,2002520," When you're in the checkout, you can send when you're in the cart, you can send a merch"
2002520,2006280," message and our producer Dan will try to respond to it."
2006280,2009160," It's going to be a bit of a shorter show today because Luke and I have to catch a flight."
2009160,2011400," We'll talk about that in a little bit."
2011400,2013400," And so our producer Dan might respond to it."
2013400,2015440," He might just put it up on the bottom."
2015440,2021840," And if there's no replies, who knows, maybe chat can help reply to your merch message."
2021840,2024800," We might need some help from you guys today."
2024800,2029960," Or Dan is going to curate some of them for me and Luke to address later on during when"
2029960,2031880," show after dark."
2031880,2035520," Since we're talking about what's going on on the store, why don't we tell you guys about"
2035520,2038960," a couple of new items."
2038960,2041120," I don't see them in the thing here."
2041120,2043880," Yes, I do see them in the thing here."
2043880,2047640," We just launched our premium joggers."
2047640,2049200," Who is this with that drip?"
2049200,2051840," It's going to be like Belomance or something."
2051840,2055640," Oh, no, it's got the, whoever it is, they've got the swag stance going on."
2055640,2059880," Definitely got the swag stance."
2059880,2062160," These are super nice, by the way."
2062160,2063600," Got them in two different colors."
2063600,2065320," I'm not sure they have to check these out."
2065320,2066520," Black and olive."
2066520,2068720," Man, love this."
2068720,2069720," Great pose."
2069720,2071560," I do want some joggers."
2071560,2072560," Sammy."
2072560,2074040," There's Sammy."
2074040,2075600," He gets the poses, man."
2075600,2076600," Yeah, Colton."
2076600,2077600," He tries."
2077600,2078600," Colton doesn't."
2078600,2079600," There's that."
2079600,2082200," We've got contrast going on."
2082200,2084040," Solid for her."
2084040,2085040," Dance."
2085040,2086040," Yeah, fantastic."
2086040,2087440," Yeah, these are super nice."
2087440,2088800," Oh, look at this."
2088800,2089800," What a nice write up."
2089800,2093600," You know how we've talked about how we don't do a good enough job sometimes?"
2093600,2094600," Let's go."
2094600,2097560," Made of 100% recycled polyester."
2097560,2099600," Sick."
2099600,2105080," We also launched one other product this week that you guys are going to want to check out."
2105080,2110000," I wouldn't necessarily wear these two together, but you know, hey, you can definitely get"
2110000,2111480," them both."
2111480,2112480," Very different feel."
2112480,2113480," Yeah."
2113480,2118360," But we've had a lot of people ask us for stuff that they can wear to work."
2118360,2123080," That still matches the comfort that they know and love from our other products, but that"
2123080,2125360," is workplace, workplace ready."
2125360,2126360," Colton."
2126360,2129200," Fucking really."
2129200,2131360," I swear I've seen him do exactly that."
2131360,2132800," I don't know why."
2132800,2133800," Yeah."
2133800,2135640," But like I've seen him do that."
2135640,2137200," Why does Colton do anything he does?"
2137200,2138200," I don't know."
2138200,2143240," Anyway, it's available in green and charcoal melange."
2143240,2147360," Super comfy and OK, who wrote these?"
2147360,2152280," This shirt is softer than a freshly pixelated kittens fur."
2152280,2155120," What?"
2155120,2156120," Pixelated kittens."
2156120,2157120," What does that even mean?"
2157120,2160360," They have no idea, but it is it is comfy."
2160360,2162360," It's interesting."
2162360,2165200," It probably would get people to keep reading."
2165200,2166600," So maybe it's good."
2166600,2171120," The joggers are available in two colors and two lengths."
2171120,2173880," And the polo shirt is available in two different colors."
2173880,2180400," Oh, now seems like as good a time as any to talk about LTT is hiring."
2180400,2181400," Oh, yes."
2181400,2184800," Wait, I'm supposed to show the jobs page and I am also."
2184800,2185800," I'll do the reading."
2185800,2186800," You'll do the read."
2186800,2189120," OK, I'll show the jobs page."
2189120,2192400," Bullet point one writer slash video producer."
2192400,2193400," Really?"
2193400,2194400," Colton."
2194400,2198920," We're specifically looking for someone to help make the kind of videos Alex makes,"
2198920,2203640," i.e. we're looking for a laptop expertise and or maker skills."
2203640,2207800," Engineering background with expertise in solid works has to be solid work specifically"
2207800,2210800," would be a really nice bonus as well."
2210800,2214800," Also, we're looking for a data visualization specialist for the labs."
2214800,2216960," Basically, make our graphs better."
2216960,2223640," This person should have great data presentation expertise, some ability as a graphic artist,"
2223640,2226840," and some ability as a data analyst."
2226840,2230640," Mr. Gary Key has written a message to our potential hires as well."
2230640,2233520," Oh, for everyone to enjoy."
2233520,2238160," It's down on the bottom of what do you want to just read it at this point?"
2238160,2240800," Oh, I was looking at the wrong screen."
2240800,2247200," If you believe you're a whoa."
2247200,2248800," This will be your boss."
2248800,2249800," Specialists."
2249800,2250800," What?"
2250800,2251800," I."
2251800,2252800," For."
2252800,2254000," If you can read it."
2254000,2257000," Yeah, got the job."
2257000,2259080," Then we won't you for the."
2259080,2260440," Then we want you for the labs."
2260440,2261440," OK."
2261440,2263400," With an eye for details."
2263400,2264680," I got there."
2264680,2266800," The an eye for details took me a second."
2266800,2270120," How are we hiring so many things right now?"
2270120,2272640," What is a project manager float plane, Luke?"
2272640,2273640," Huh?"
2273640,2274800," What's a project manager?"
2274800,2275800," What is this?"
2275800,2278080," It's a project projector man and manager."
2278080,2280200," OK, thanks, Gary Key."
2280200,2281680," Yeah, no worries."
2281680,2282680," OK."
2282680,2284880," We're closing the back end one."
2284880,2286840," I finished writing that contract today."
2286840,2287840," Accounting just needs to sign it off."
2287840,2289320," We're closing that position."
2289320,2290960," Let's go."
2290960,2294240," The project manager one is probably going to go away as well."
2294240,2295240," Oh, OK."
2295240,2299920," And but not because I found someone just because it's not really working."
2299920,2300920," You give up."
2300920,2301920," OK."
2301920,2303920," Well, hey, there's time, I guess."
2303920,2308560," Oh, there is going to be probably we're looking through current applicants."
2308560,2313320," But if that doesn't work out, we might be making another posting for a front"
2313320,2315200," imposition for a float plane as well."
2315200,2315840," All right."
2315840,2317560," Yeah."
2317560,2318440," How are we still OK?"
2318440,2322200," We need to take a little break at some minor pre budgeted and have"
2322200,2323120," been budgeted for a while."
2323120,2323640," I know."
2323640,2324160," I know."
2324160,2324920," Mine are good."
2324920,2325920," We might alone."
2325920,2326440," I know."
2326440,2328960," Me mine."
2328960,2330320," Why do we do a couple of merge messages?"
2330320,2331640," Dan hit us."
2331640,2332880," Sure thing."
2332880,2338920," Hello, L L N D with the end or near the end of Moore's law."
2338920,2342400," How do you expect to see continued generational performance improvement"
2342400,2345040," as the transistors can no longer shrink?"
2345040,2353000," You know, I just--"
2353000,2359160," I-- it seems impossible."
2359160,2360440," But they keep doing it."
2360440,2363800," Yeah, they keep finding some lever to turn some wheel to crank."
2363800,2364160," Yeah."
2364160,2365960," IPC improvements."
2365960,2366440," Yeah."
2366440,2367960," Like there's-- there's things that--"
2367960,2369440," Well, 3D stacking."
2369440,2369960," Oh, yeah."
2369960,2373120," Looks like it is going to be huge."
2373120,2376680," Chiplets look like they are going to be huge."
2376680,2380880," We might find other ways to expand the amount that you're using."
2380880,2381240," Yeah."
2381240,2383360," That's necessarily the amount we can fit in a certain area."
2383360,2387480," Like, OK, technology like in Intel's Foveros chip"
2387480,2389480," where they've got-- I forget."
2389480,2393880," It's like three or four different manufacturing processes"
2393880,2396960," and all these buses that are communicating with each other"
2396960,2399880," on this giant package."
2399880,2404800," Stuff like that is going to make its way to consumer technology"
2404800,2407320," or to consumer electronics at some point"
2407320,2411080," and could be a game changer."
2411080,2418160," I mean, the way that AI is changing the game too is massive."
2418160,2423280," I think that we are super mad about NVIDIA giving us"
2423280,2427120," underpowered gaming chips at a price that isn't"
2427120,2428840," palatable right now."
2428840,2430800," But when we look back--"
2430800,2435400," so 10 years from now, when we're playing photo-realistic games"
2435400,2438400," at 300 frames per second or whatever--"
2438400,2443000," on chips that fundamentally haven't changed nearly as much"
2443000,2445440," as the 10 years prior, we're going"
2445440,2449800," to be looking at it going, wow, they were way ahead."
2449800,2454360," And that was early teething pain for what was ultimately"
2454360,2457680," going to be the future."
2457680,2460040," I mean, just looking at the way that--"
2460040,2466240," man, I was looking at this new Photoshop feature"
2466240,2469320," where you basically just give it an image"
2469320,2473200," and then just tell it, oh, yeah, I want a lake in the middle"
2473200,2475840," and I want a car and I want a cloud that's shaped like the car."
2475840,2477600," You saw the same article I did."
2477600,2480280," I meant to send it to our thumbnail designer,"
2480280,2480880," but I forgot."
2480880,2481880," Yeah."
2481880,2482560," I'm sure there are already--"
2482560,2485120," So Photoshop just has generative AI built in."
2485120,2487840," And if we're doing that in Photoshop now,"
2487840,2489600," then give it a little bit more time"
2489600,2492160," and we'll be doing that in real time in games."
2492160,2496680," You'll be able to mod a game by simply typing in a prompt."
2496680,2499240," OK, I want to play Super Mario World,"
2499240,2502840," but all of the koopas are--"
2502840,2505440," procedurally generated games are going to be a whole new--"
2505440,2507320," Little faces with mustaches."
2507320,2508320," Ball of wax."
2508320,2509560," Like, that's insane."
2509560,2511920," I don't think I've even thought about that before."
2511920,2515480," Procedurally generated games have to pre-make the assets."
2515480,2516640," Yeah."
2516640,2519080," It's just like, I want to play Half-Life 2,"
2519080,2521920," but all the opponents are donkeys."
2521920,2522600," And you know what?"
2522600,2525160," It's not going to be perfect, but it's"
2525160,2527920," going to get pretty good."
2527920,2531000," Like, you can hugely simplify the modding scene"
2531000,2531840," for certain things."
2531840,2532880," You know when they make like--"
2532880,2534520," they made all the dragons in Skyrim"
2534520,2536680," into Thomas the Tank Engine or whatever?"
2536680,2538120," I didn't do that, but I love it."
2538120,2538840," That's my favorite."
2538840,2540000," It's a fantastic mod."
2540000,2541480," Amazing."
2541480,2542680," They even look true."
2542680,2545680," Yeah, when they fly in, you normally hear the dragon roar."
2545680,2549880," They have a train roar."
2549880,2551000," It's very good."
2551000,2552240," It's very good."
2552240,2555320," But you could do stuff like that using this instead."
2555320,2556160," Oh, did you find it?"
2556160,2559120," [LAUGHTER]"
2559120,2559920," Oh."
2559920,2560880," Do you want sound?"
2560880,2561440," No, no."
2561440,2564640," I don't think sound will be necessary entirely."
2564640,2566400," So it's going to land on top of the tower"
2566400,2567400," that you're looking at right now."
2567400,2568000," Spoiler."
2568000,2571600," If you have-- oh, come on, it's Skyrim."
2571600,2572600," Yeah."
2572600,2575880," [LAUGHTER]"
2575880,2578280," Is he a fighter out in the background?"
2578280,2579800," It's going to slam down."
2579800,2582800," [LAUGHTER]"
2582800,2588040," There's people who would-- they'd be like,"
2588040,2589200," arachnophobic or whatever."
2589200,2591360," So they would replace all the spiders in the game"
2591360,2594080," with like, deady bears or whatever else to it."
2594080,2595080," Right."
2595080,2595560," Yeah."
2595560,2598680," So yeah, that sort of thing is only going to get easier."
2598680,2599720," Oh, so good."
2599720,2601080," Which is great."
2601080,2602080," Yeah."
2602080,2606080," [LAUGHTER]"
2606080,2607120," Oh, man."
2607120,2609960," You know what would be really interesting?"
2609960,2611560," Oh, man."
2611560,2612560," I wonder if we'll get to the point."
2612560,2615040," You know how we've been waiting for--"
2615040,2618760," or I have, whatever-- for Skyblivian and more"
2618760,2622520," Blivian or more Skywind, sorry."
2622520,2623000," There we go."
2623000,2626680," Which are it's Morrowind and Oblivion rebuilt in Skyrim's"
2626680,2630600," Engine with really high resolution textures"
2630600,2631640," and all this other kind of stuff."
2631640,2634000," Because you can do some pretty cool things in Skyrim's Engine,"
2634000,2636400," even though it's pretty old."
2636400,2639760," I think we're going to get to a certain point eventually,"
2639760,2641960," where because of-- because like, yeah,"
2641960,2643560," it's going to have some issues doing this kind of stuff"
2643560,2645560," out of nowhere, creativity problems, all that kind of stuff."
2645560,2646920," It pulls from something, whatever."
2646920,2650680," But you might be able to go like, OK, here's a game."
2650680,2652560," Here's all the information I have, all the local files,"
2652560,2653320," all that kind of stuff."
2653320,2657120," I want you to recreate this using UE5 or whatever."
2657120,2659120," I want you to recreate this using this other thing."
2659120,2660600," Oh, I see what you mean."
2660600,2663120," Because it's pretty good at like translating, right?"
2663120,2665840," Even stuff like RTX Remix."
2665840,2667760," OK."
2667760,2671560," Just AI replace all the light sources with real point"
2671560,2674240," light sources."
2674240,2675560," And then you'll have to go in and tweak it."
2675560,2678240," You'll still have to be a graphic designer, a game"
2678240,2679240," designer, or whatever else."
2679240,2681120," It's still take work."
2681120,2682960," But man."
2682960,2686320," It's like the generative AI in Photoshop, right?"
2686320,2687920," It's not replacing artists."
2687920,2688440," Yeah."
2688440,2690240," We still need an artist to do that."
2690240,2692000," I mean, all the same people that do all the same stuff,"
2692000,2693800," they just make their job easier."
2693800,2695640," Well, more realistically, it makes it"
2695640,2696920," so they have to do more of it."
2696920,2697920," But yeah."
2697920,2701440," Because that's what working here is like."
2701440,2706160," There's always going to be stuff to do that is never a concern."
2706160,2709360," I mean, that's what work is like, Luke."
2709360,2710640," I don't make the freaking--"
2710640,2714040," I was reading an article."
2714040,2714960," They surveyed a bunch of--"
2714960,2716560," I was saying that in a bad way to be clear."
2716560,2719240," They surveyed a bunch of Gen Z and millennial people"
2719240,2722640," who have sort of pioneered this concept of--"
2722640,2726240," it's called lying flat in China or quiet quitting"
2726240,2731840," in North America of their top priorities being work-life"
2731840,2734040," balance, as opposed to all these other things."
2734040,2737760," And then when they continue asking them questions,"
2737760,2738880," they're like, OK, right."
2738880,2742160," But is that a thing?"
2742160,2744440," And they're like, no."
2744440,2747240," No, actually, I have a second job of hustling."
2747240,2748880," Because--"
2748880,2749800," You get bored."
2749800,2750600," Well, no."
2750600,2754440," No, it's just inflation's out of control."
2754440,2756640," It's not actually feasible."
2756640,2759680," Like, you have to bust your butt."
2759680,2762440," And so it's this sort of aspirational thing."
2762440,2768400," I don't know."
2768400,2769880," It's a big challenge."
2769880,2773560," It's one of those things where I feel like we do,"
2773560,2775880," I think, a pretty good job of trying"
2775880,2779360," to make it so that people don't have to work outside"
2779360,2780240," their 40 hours."
2780240,2784440," But--"
2784440,2785040," It's tough right now."
2785040,2788080," By and large, the way the world's going right now,"
2788080,2790680," it's not like that."
2790680,2794560," It has shifted from an employee's market"
2794560,2796880," to an employer's market, like looking at what's going on"
2796880,2799280," with the big tech firms and the way"
2799280,2803320," that they're bringing everyone back to office, cutting perks,"
2803320,2807000," laying off literally thousands, sometimes tens of thousands"
2807000,2808560," of staff."
2808560,2811640," I watched a video recently of a certain excessively rich"
2811640,2812400," person."
2812400,2813840," And it was like--"
2813840,2814760," How much is a banana?"
2814760,2815560," If we--"
2815560,2816400," No, something else."
2816400,2817560," That was really funny."
2817560,2818240," That was really funny."
2818240,2819160," Very funny."
2819160,2822200," But no, they were like, OK, if we take this person's net wealth"
2822200,2825080," in single American dollar bills--"
2825080,2827320," so like one US dollar, because I know a lot of other countries"
2827320,2829200," don't have that, so I'm making sure you know--"
2829200,2831840," and we stacked it horizontally and tried"
2831840,2833200," to wrap around the world."
2833200,2833700," Yeah."
2833700,2834200," How many times?"
2834200,2836080," How far do we get?"
2836080,2837720," Single US dollar bills."
2837720,2838560," Like the width."
2838560,2839640," Almost-- yeah."
2839640,2840720," Pressed against each other."
2840720,2841080," Right."
2841080,2841240," OK."
2841240,2843160," You almost make it the whole way around the world."
2843160,2843680," Wow."
2843680,2844640," It's just like--"
2844640,2848200," Does this make any sense?"
2848200,2849120," Like, I don't know."
2849120,2850160," Anyways, sorry."
2850160,2852640," I'm going to get back on the tech topics."
2852640,2854760," Oh, no, I think we're supposed to actually do a couple"
2854760,2855400," more merch messages."
2855400,2860360," Yeah, give us a merch message anyway."
2860360,2860800," Yeah."
2860800,2861160," Come on."
2861160,2861660," Yeah."
2861660,2862600," Give us a merch message, baby."
2862600,2863920," This one's from Jordan."
2863920,2868600," What's the longest you have ever worked in one shift?"
2868600,2869600," Oh, I mean, there was--"
2869600,2871800," I knew that would get a giggle from Luke."
2871800,2874600," Peanut butter crackers."
2874600,2875600," 700 series launch."
2875600,2876400," What?"
2876400,2877360," 700 series launch."
2877360,2880480," I'm pretty sure I was awake for like four days."
2880480,2881480," See, I don't know."
2881480,2885240," I've done some pretty dumb stuff, too."
2885240,2887200," It depends on how we define work."
2887200,2890480," Like, we didn't used to classify sitting on a plane as work,"
2890480,2895480," but we apparently do now."
2895480,2896480," Oh, per--"
2896480,2897280," It's complicated."
2897280,2897960," Yeah."
2897960,2900840," Yeah, it's complicated."
2900840,2904640," But I remember when David and I and--"
2904640,2906600," someone from the business team came with us."
2906600,2907480," I can't remember."
2907480,2910560," But we went to and from Germany in like 30 hours."
2910560,2911760," Like, doorstep to doorstep."
2911760,2912600," I remember this, yeah."
2912600,2916640," So that wasn't technically one shift, but good gravy."
2916640,2917760," Was that ever intense?"
2917760,2920400," Because that's like an 11 hour flight or something like that,"
2920400,2921480," or like nine hour flight."
2921480,2923200," I can't remember exactly how long it is."
2923200,2924720," We shot a video on the other side."
2924720,2927120," Like, we worked."
2927120,2929960," And then we were back."
2929960,2934040," Those touch and go trips can be pretty exhausting."
2934040,2934800," Yeah."
2934800,2935320," Yeah."
2935320,2935840," Yeah."
2935840,2944840," I think that trip to Germany was probably my worst."
2944840,2947920," The worst recently was what we went through with the channel"
2947920,2949320," hijacking, though, I think."
2949320,2951400," It hasn't been that bad in a while."
2951400,2952000," We try."
2952000,2953560," We actually try."
2953560,2956440," People are constantly-- why do you have so many people on staff?"
2956440,2957000," Because we're trying."
2957000,2958480," Because we are actually trying."
2958480,2959480," Because we're trying."
2959480,2960480," Yeah."
2960480,2962160," It's not always easy."
2962160,2963000," They enjoyed that one."
2963000,2964400," Because--"
2964400,2966120," This is my-- I'm broken."
2966120,2968720," And this is my problem."
2968720,2971280," Because you're like talking about how that's a victory."
2971280,2974520," But for me, those are all like my favorite memories."
2974520,2977480," But then I have to remember that that's not normal."
2977480,2978640," That's not real is."
2978640,2979880," So I wore that."
2979880,2980200," Yeah."
2980200,2981960," Because I will break."
2981960,2983480," So I have to like--"
2983480,2984560," But I enjoy those."
2984560,2986680," So I kind of like it when it happens sometimes."
2986680,2987200," Yeah."
2987200,2991120," But I don't like it probably shouldn't happen too often."
2991120,2991560," I'm old now."
2991560,2992400," I can't do that all the time."
2992400,2993280," But I do like those roles."
2993280,2994480," You're old."
2994480,2995840," I'm getting there."
2995840,2996480," I'm getting there."
2996480,2998480," I'm starting to feel it."
2998480,3000800," The recovery time from things is getting long."
3000800,3001800," Oh, yeah."
3001800,3002800," Oh, it doesn't get better."
3002800,3004960," That's the main thing that I'm noticing."
3004960,3007120," Not a lot else is really that--"
3007120,3012120," But if I go too far, it's like, OK, I need to rest."
3012120,3014000," I'll be like, I'll be good in like a day."
3014000,3015840," And then it's like a week passes."
3015840,3017440," And I'm like, I'm still feeling it."
3017440,3018120," Yep."
3018120,3019120," Yep."
3019120,3019920," Yeah."
3019920,3021760," It's not going to get better from here on out."
3021760,3022960," I'll tell you that much."
3022960,3023720," 30's rough."
3023720,3025320," 35's worse."
3025320,3027320," Nice."
3027320,3032080," I had my badminton training session last night,"
3032080,3034200," my Thursday night session."
3034200,3036800," I didn't message you this because Luke was messaging me"
3036800,3038360," the week prior, I think, telling me"
3038360,3040760," how much water he drank at one of his things."
3040760,3048360," So in two hours and 20 minutes, I drank two and a half of these."
3048360,3051560," That is 100 ounces of water."
3051560,3052800," And let me put it this way."
3052800,3055760," I didn't go pee."
3055760,3058880," I am fucking annihilated right now."
3058880,3062840," I'm like, I am so sore and so tired."
3062840,3064960," I don't know what he was trying to do to me."
3064960,3065760," I told him."
3065760,3068800," I was like, David, I'm going to Taiwan"
3068800,3073000," to play badminton every day and cover a trade show."
3073000,3075760," Why are we doing all smash practice today?"
3075760,3079000," [LAUGHTER]"
3079000,3080840," We've been planning this video for a long time,"
3080840,3081840," and things just keep coming up."
3081840,3084840," But we will do it, where we're going to go to the gym."
3084840,3087280," And I at no point in time have actually"
3087280,3091680," known what the point was or what we're actually supposed to do."
3091680,3093160," So I've had-- I've just in my head,"
3093160,3097240," I've had these various ideas for like a while."
3097240,3099600," Just different like, ah, maybe we'll do this."
3099600,3100560," Maybe we'll do that."
3100560,3102080," And then eventually I was like, you know,"
3102080,3104200," I was hoping this is going to be a recurring thing,"
3104200,3105360," and it's not going to be."
3105360,3108760," So I'm just going to like, herd him."
3108760,3109200," What?"
3109200,3113400," I'm just going to make it so hard that like he's just"
3113400,3115280," going to wake up the day and not be able to move."
3115280,3118880," And then I was like, I enjoyed this idea."
3118880,3120200," And then I was like, no, I can't."
3120200,3121640," Because like, we're too old now."
3121640,3124320," If we were back when we first started doing this,"
3124320,3125920," that would have probably been fine."
3125920,3126520," Yeah."
3126520,3128600," If this was 10 years ago, we probably"
3128600,3129760," would have both been fine."
3129760,3132400," But now if I do that, it's like actually"
3132400,3133400," going to be a problem."
3133400,3135080," And you'd probably make me do it with you."
3135080,3138800," So we'd both just be wrecked for like ever."
3138800,3140000," OK, well, I can't do that."
3140000,3141440," So back to the drawing board."
3141440,3142440," It's like, oh, man."
3142440,3144440," All right."
3144440,3146000," [SIGHS]"
3146000,3148280," All right, why don't we jump into our next topic here?"
3148280,3151640," No one wants to buy the RTX 4060 Ti,"
3151640,3156080," in spite of my best efforts after taking a back alley deal"
3156080,3159920," from NVIDIA to promote their new GPU."
3159920,3164360," Slash S."
3164360,3168440," NVIDIA's new RTX 4060 Ti has been met with low consumer interest."
3168440,3173120," Many retailers only ordered a few cards per store."
3173120,3175520," And in some areas, especially Europe,"
3175520,3179040," they're already offering the cards for $10 to $25"
3179040,3181040," below the recommended retail price."
3181040,3183120," And this is probably because in Europe,"
3183120,3186560," the recommended retail prices are particularly brutal."
3186560,3190240," Because NVIDIA apparently doesn't attend the XC.com"
3190240,3193080," school of how currency conversion works."
3193080,3196320," At the same time, though, NVIDIA's market valuation"
3196320,3199680," increased by 30%."
3199680,3204480," 30% their stock went up in the last two days"
3204480,3209120," or something like that due to high demand for LLM chips."
3209120,3213080," So large language model chips, like machine learning chips."
3213080,3215040," [SIGHS]"
3215040,3218680," NVIDIA don't give a f-- about gamers anymore."
3218680,3220480," It's so annoying because like--"
3220480,3220960," Yeah."
3220960,3223960," They had crypto stuff, and then that sort of died."
3223960,3225120," And we were like, yeah."
3225120,3226440," Come back to us."
3226440,3228000," Come crawling back, baby."
3228000,3231840," And they're back for like, what, not even a year?"
3231840,3234200," And they're like, oh, new wave to ride."
3234200,3235200," Let's go."
3235200,3238480," Like, oh, come on."
3238480,3241720," [SIGHS]"
3241720,3244000," Oh, well."
3244000,3248200," Anyway, AMD, of course, dropped prices on the 7,600 XT"
3248200,3252520," down to 269, only 36 hours before launch."
3252520,3255760," OK, I'd actually like to talk about that."
3255760,3258240," We had a whole stick for that video,"
3258240,3261160," where the intro was going to be AMD."
3261160,3263640," I'd be happy to help you learn how to benchmark"
3263640,3266000," GPUs so that you can price your cards appropriately."
3266000,3267680," And we actually left in part of it."
3267680,3268960," And then we kind of went--"
3268960,3269880," records got you."
3269880,3271880," [SIGHS]"
3271880,3274280," AMD changed the price of the card."
3274280,3281640," If all-- I don't want us to get too good guy AMD"
3281640,3284520," about them bringing this card out at a price that"
3284520,3286720," is somewhat reasonable."
3286720,3288320," Because it's somewhat reasonable."
3288320,3291960," Because, yeah, A, it's only somewhat reasonable."
3291960,3293840," It's in line with the rest of their lineup,"
3293840,3297680," which they did get aggressive on a little bit."
3297680,3300920," But that's only to deal with the fact"
3300920,3304280," that GPU demand is apparently at a historic low right now"
3304280,3305440," or something like that."
3305440,3308240," This is not out of the goodness of their hearts."
3308240,3315640," And B, they only did it at the last second."
3315640,3317880," Like, very last second."
3317880,3321360," Changing the price of a GPU a day and a half"
3321360,3327680," before its public launch is a colossal undertaking."
3327680,3331280," Because they have to basically redo all the contracts"
3331280,3334680," that they have with their board partners."
3334680,3338480," They have to go and do a whole bunch of paperwork."
3338480,3340880," I mean, I imagine the accounting department would"
3340880,3343800," absolutely hate this."
3343800,3347000," And I want us to not lose track of the fact"
3347000,3351200," that if they were able to price it at $269, 36 hours"
3351200,3358400," from launch, they could have priced it at $269, 36 days from launch."
3358400,3361040," There is nothing about the cost of this card"
3361040,3365200," that necessitated the $299 price that they originally"
3365200,3367520," announced to the press."
3367520,3370080," Nothing, clearly."
3370080,3375520," And it was only due to some kind of probably intense pressure"
3375520,3378480," that they would have made a last minute change like this."
3380960,3383760," So I'm annoyed."
3383760,3387920," I find it extremely disrespectful when these good guy"
3387920,3390520," buy association."
3390520,3392000," Because the other guy's worse?"
3392000,3397080," Yeah, well, it's more just like they could have just done this."
3397080,3400240," They could have been pro-consumer."
3400240,3403240," They could have cared about consumer value in the first place."
3403240,3407000," And they could have had it at a good price."
3407000,3407920," But they didn't."
3407920,3411760," There's clearly a lot of internal forces at AMD"
3411760,3415720," that wanted this card to be priced as high as the market"
3415720,3417000," could possibly bear."
3417000,3418400," And it was only at the last second"
3418400,3421800," that they ultimately made the decision to back down."
3421800,3425240," And it's extremely disrespectful to everyone else"
3425240,3427720," who's involved in the launch of a product like this,"
3427720,3429320," including media partners."
3429320,3432240," And I know there's going to be the people out there who's"
3432240,3433040," takes-- you know what?"
3433040,3435320," Yeah, maybe I will just start shadow-bending"
3435320,3437240," because they're phenomenally stupid."
3437240,3440640," But whose takes on this are going to be, oh, wow,"
3440640,3444200," complaining about free GPUs."
3444200,3446480," Do you think I need a 7,600 XT?"
3446480,3450560," Do you think that meaningfully changes my life?"
3450560,3455000," This is-- our job is to make these reviews"
3455000,3457600," so that people know what to buy."
3457600,3459040," That's the whole point."
3459040,3461680," And then the way that that symbiotic relationship works"
3461680,3464680," with the manufacturers is if they make a good product,"
3464680,3467440," then as long as we are independent and trusted,"
3467440,3470520," that will dramatically improve their sales."
3470520,3473080," And the second we're not independent and trusted,"
3473080,3474600," it will have no impact whatsoever."
3474600,3478160," So it's in their interest to support an independent media."
3478160,3478660," Right?"
3478660,3484120," And so when they don't give us the tools"
3484120,3488200," to do our jobs properly, well, it's disrespectful to us."
3488200,3490120," And it's also disrespectful to you guys."
3490120,3493320," There was a not insignificant probability"
3493320,3496760," that if any outlet had a family emergency or something"
3496760,3501000," like that, they wouldn't be able to get the proper message"
3501000,3501720," out to their viewers."
3501720,3504120," Now, the good news is that for any written outlet,"
3504120,3508640," a price change is theoretically pretty easy to adjust."
3508640,3516600," You just go, oh, OK, control H299, 269, have a replace."
3516600,3520560," But because it so dramatically changed"
3520560,3522920," the value proposition of this card, which"
3522920,3526880," is a value tier card, I wouldn't say budget,"
3526880,3529360," but definitely it's about the value."
3529360,3531400," You're not buying a 7,600 XT because you're"
3531400,3533360," going for the utmost in performance."
3533360,3535480," You want bang for the buck, right?"
3535480,3542400," And it changed the angle of the video a lot."
3542400,3544280," And for video, that's even harder to adjust"
3544280,3545680," because you need to change the script,"
3545680,3546480," then you need to reshoot it."
3546480,3548600," We actually had to fully reshoot that video."
3548600,3552080," The only reason that we reused some of our original shoot"
3552080,3555160," was because I just kind of thought it was funny"
3555160,3560240," to have my outfit changed sporadically throughout the video."
3560240,3564560," Yeah, yeah, OK."
3564560,3565720," Oh, OK, this is great."
3565720,3568200," In our notes here, it says, communication of the drop"
3568200,3569960," was scattered, and some reviews did actually"
3569960,3574720," go up based on the original price, which is not a proper service"
3574720,3576520," to you, the viewer."
3576520,3578320," AMD's board partners seem to have"
3578320,3580640," stuck with the 270 price, with the exception"
3580640,3585920," of the ROG Strix OC edition at $340."
3585920,3587680," And then Best Buy has made the interesting choice"
3587680,3590040," to price multiple models of the 7,600 at $380."
3590040,3592440," And that's probably because they haven't actually"
3592440,3596680," gotten written signed confirmation of any kind of rebates"
3596680,3599920," that they might be getting on these cards that they probably"
3599920,3602640," got allocation of completely sight unseen,"
3602640,3604280," not knowing what the pricing was, or they"
3604280,3607240," got the original pricing only for it to change later."
3607240,3609320," Intel, apparently, though, took the opportunity"
3609320,3614040," to slash the A750 to 199."
3614040,3617800," That's actually a pretty interesting price."
3617800,3621400," AV1 encoding, solid 1080p performance."
3621400,3624600," And with being able to stream--"
3624600,3627960," there's a very strong argument at that price for streamers"
3627960,3630680," grabbing that just as their streaming card."
3630680,3632520," Yeah, $200."
3632520,3634680," Man, that's a lot of hardware for $200."
3634680,3638680," Meanwhile, meanwhile, NVIDIA wants $100"
3638680,3641440," for just eight gigs of the RAM on that card."
3641440,3647040," And if it doesn't sell, man, I just"
3647040,3649680," don't think they're going to give any Fs."
3649680,3651000," They're so busy."
3651000,3652200," The LLM cards, whatever."
3652200,3656520," They're so busy selling every wafer they can book at TSMC"
3656520,3659040," right now to AI startup."
3659040,3660560," They always not perform more time."
3660560,3661440," Yeah, it cares."
3661440,3662160," Yeah, whatever."
3662160,3666760," Just shift production to Tesla's or whatever."
3666760,3669160," Or AA, whatever they call it these days."
3669160,3670720," I think the Tesla branding is gone."
3670720,3672320," But--"
3672320,3673280," Is it A 4000?"
3673280,3674480," Is that right?"
3674480,3675440," No, I think it's not."
3675440,3677200," I think it's A6000 or something like that."
3677200,3679880," I can't remember anymore, because it seems like they"
3679880,3683400," have intentionally made their product stack just completely"
3683400,3684720," unintuitive."
3684720,3687080," Why did they take away the Quadro name?"
3687080,3687920," It was so good."
3687920,3691160," Yeah, and then they had two different generations"
3691160,3693680," of workstation cards that have the same model--"
3693680,3695760," The only thing that they did that I didn't like"
3695760,3698240," was they would have weird, like, best-by-exclusive"
3698240,3701160," generations and then skip over them for everybody else."
3701160,3702360," That was the only thing."
3702360,3704840," Basically, all the rest of it was fine."
3704840,3705680," Just leave it alone."
3705680,3708120," Oh, now Nvidia's naming is a nightmare."
3708120,3708800," Yeah, it's a mess."
3708800,3710680," So is AMD's for that matter."
3710680,3714280," I have gained a renewed interest in AMD's cards,"
3714280,3719560," because they're just a killer value right now from about $180"
3719560,3723240," up to realistically $450, $500."
3723240,3727480," And so as part of that scrapyard GPU war thing,"
3727480,3730400," where I was trying to get the best bang for the buck GPU"
3730400,3733720," for around the price of a 4060 TI at retail,"
3733720,3737480," I ended up doing a bunch of research into AMD cards"
3737480,3740080," that I hadn't really paid much attention to."
3740080,3742800," Their product stack is a mess."
3742800,3749160," They have a 6600, a 6600 XT, and then they have a 6650 XT."
3749160,3752720," But then in the 7,000 generation, they're not doing 50s."
3752720,3757520," They're doing XTX for the more better one."
3757520,3761280," And I'm just-- I'm looking at this going, what the--"
3761280,3763200," what the hell is going on?"
3763200,3764520," Sometimes you have an XT."
3764520,3765960," Sometimes you have a 50."
3765960,3768720," Sometimes the XT is a huge jump."
3768720,3772160," Sometimes the 50 is a big jump, but they're both XT's."
3772160,3778560," I cannot wait for the lab to just have a database where I can"
3778560,3781640," just go, OK, get back game at that resolution"
3781640,3784480," and just show me all of them."
3784480,3785840," Please."
3785840,3786840," Lab, I'm so ready."
3786840,3788920," All right, I haven't told them yet."
3788920,3791640," But one of the things that I would like for us to do--"
3791640,3794800," never mind GPU reviews--"
3794800,3796880," one of the things that I would like for them to do"
3796880,3802720," is have enough test benches that we can run in parallel"
3802720,3808000," and we can basically, like, once a year, maybe twice a year"
3808000,3810280," if we can make it automated enough,"
3810280,3813600," we just throw every card back on,"
3813600,3816600," run it with the latest drivers, and just have this database"
3816600,3818680," be up to date."
3818680,3821480," So you can just compare functionally anything"
3821480,3823000," with a PCIe slot."
3823000,3829120," I have vaguely mentioned this, and I saw hearts shatter."
3829120,3830560," But I'm sure we'll get there eventually."
3830560,3832320," I think it'll-- I just think it'll take a long time."
3832320,3833520," They just need more test benches."
3833520,3838320," I mean, if it gets as simple as we can use machine vision"
3838320,3840040," to set up--"
3840040,3841040," Pretty much everything."
3841040,3842080," --the infrastructure behind all that is going to be, like,"
3842080,3843400," pretty intense."
3843400,3846040," Yeah, but that sounds like videos to me."
3846040,3848760," Like I said, it's very--"
3848760,3851520," I believe we can get there."
3851520,3853080," But I don't expect it soon."
3853080,3854120," That's all I'm saying."
3854120,3855840," They got a lot of stuff going on."
3855840,3857840," There's a lot of moving parts in that there, Lab."
3857840,3862840," Yeah, I'm excited, man."
3862840,3864240," It's going to be awesome."
3864240,3865240," It's going to be awesome."
3865240,3866840," I had someone ask in Flip Plane Chat today"
3866840,3871040," if we would make content about cards pretty deep"
3871040,3872840," into their lifecycle, talking about their performance"
3872840,3875240," on new drivers."
3875240,3876840," I don't think that that's something"
3876840,3878640," that you're going to see very often."
3878640,3881920," I don't think the content on LTT."
3881920,3885800," But I think that's something where the Lab could end up"
3885800,3888520," digging up cool outliers."
3888520,3896360," Like, man, how would we train it to look for weird anomalies?"
3896360,3899960," Like, hey, flag it for us if this card has increased"
3899960,3900760," in performance by 4%--"
3900760,3902160," I was going to say, I have more than 20% of it."
3902160,3906600," If we've tested it in the past, that would help a lot,"
3906600,3910680," because then if a test is way outside of expected change,"
3910680,3911960," then we would know."
3911960,3913800," Yeah, I guess so."
3913800,3916320," And we're going to have to have weekly meetings with the Lab."
3916320,3917880," Like, OK, what have you tested?"
3917880,3920240," What's interesting?"
3920240,3924760," I had a meeting with James today about what our channel"
3924760,3928240," strategy is going to look like going forward."
3928240,3933360," And it's kind of like content kind of rolls down"
3933360,3934920," a hill sort of thing."
3934920,3939680," So LTT started out as simple basic reading the packaging"
3939680,3941640," unboxings, essentially."
3941640,3945360," And then it turned into more testing and reviews."
3945360,3947960," And then it turned into bigger projects"
3947960,3949720," and became very personality-driven."
3949720,3951760," And now it's sort of reached--"
3951760,3952840," It's like a show."
3952840,3955240," Yeah, I would say it's reached kind of an end game"
3955240,3956560," as far as that goes."
3956560,3960880," And then we identified that there was this content gap"
3960880,3962600," that we were no longer filling."
3962600,3965040," And we went, oh, OK, how about short circuit then?"
3965040,3968800," Short circuit will now do the simple, easy, cheapo unboxed."
3968800,3971200," OK, no, we're going to start adding data to short circuit."
3971200,3973160," Let's make that more like a review."
3973160,3975520," OK, but then what about these simple unboxings?"
3975520,3976240," Well, you know what?"
3976240,3977720," We're going to have data for those two,"
3977720,3980600," and then we're going to do these category specific channels."
3980600,3985160," I think you guys might be disappointed when"
3985160,3987560," you see the production values of these--"
3987560,3990080," Oh, yeah, we're making a video on every single power"
3990080,3991400," supply that ever exists."
3991400,3996240," It might just be hands unboxing some very basic B-roll."
3996240,4000680," We might have to find a way to essentially cut these with AI"
4000680,4002520," and then have an editor go in and fix."
4002520,4004880," There are AI video editing tools."
4004880,4008400," Like, it might be pretty basic."
4008400,4013680," But if our goal is to have a video that could belong on every"
4013680,4016040," single product page on Newegg or something like that in the"
4016040,4023960," longer term here, realistically, how much more is there going"
4023960,4031240," to be for us to say about the 13500 or the 13400 core i5?"
4034480,4038520," Man, I'm going to be really interested to see what we'll be"
4038520,4044360," able to do with a lab's data sheet, a large language model,"
4044360,4047080," and a writer to kind of go in and clean it up."
4047080,4050040," That's going to need that."
4050040,4055000," Where we basically just go, OK, feed the LLM, all the"
4055000,4060320," performance data and specs of this product, and everything"
4060320,4067240," within $50 of it on either side and the top tier from that"
4067240,4069200," generation."
4069200,4070280," What would it spit out?"
4070280,4074760," Would it say, compared to AMD's, whatever, it's like this."
4074760,4079520," And that's still 30% worse than the best Intel has to offer."
4079520,4084600," But if we gave it enough samples, if we wrote them"
4084600,4087600," manually to start and then fed that to it, would it be able"
4087600,4090000," to generate anything usable?"
4090000,4091440," I don't even know."
4091440,4093440," What could be kind of interesting is, eventually, if we"
4093440,4099160," have site analytic user, how people use the lab's website,"
4099160,4101960," analytics that are good, we could use that to fuel"
4101960,4103360," content direction."
4103360,4106400," If we start noticing a ton of people start comparing some"
4106400,4110160," certain cards or whatever, we could be like, maybe content"
4110160,4111120," time."
4111120,4112400," That's pretty cool."
4112400,4113480," I do stuff like that."
4113480,4115920," OK, I'm liking that."
4115920,4116400," Not yet."
4116400,4117360," Not yet."
4117360,4118320," It's going to take time."
4118320,4118800," Yeah."
4118800,4119240," That's fine."
4119240,4119880," We've got time."
4119880,4122600," We've got money, speaking of which, ltstore.com."
4122600,4123120," Yeah."
4123120,4125560," And speaking of which, our sponsors."
4125560,4128440," The show is brought to you today by Vessi."
4128440,4131800," Are you thinking of stepping to like Linus?"
4131800,4133880," Well, instead of stepping down, you"
4133880,4137280," should step up with Vessi's boardwalk slip on sneakers."
4137280,4138320," Thanks, Dennis."

4167520,4169880," Are you tired of slogging through complex code"
4169880,4173000," just to implement SMS voice or video capabilities"
4173000,4174840," into your projects?"
4174840,4176760," Well, Signal Wire makes your life easier"
4176760,4178840," by adding essential communications capabilities"

4185200,4187320," one of the world's largest open source communication"

4188240,4190000," And it makes it simple to add in features"

4205800,4208080," build an interactive voice response, register messaging"
4208080,4211760," campaigns, or route phone numbers to your personal phone."
4211760,4213480," The show is also brought to you by, oh, this"
4213480,4215200," is a super cool monitor."
4215200,4218640," I am actually considering-- OK, I'll read the talking points"
4218640,4221720," at some point, but I'm pretty close to swapping out"
4221720,4224680," my 120 Hertz 16 by 9 for this thing at home."
4224680,4227320," I've had it on my test bench in the garage"
4227320,4229480," ever since we did the review."
4229480,4232880," And every time I'm out there, I'm just like,"
4232880,4234760," yeah, I should just bring this inside."
4234760,4238120," And it's done little things."
4238120,4239920," OK, some done not done little things."
4239920,4243240," Being able to adjust the angle is super cool."
4243240,4246960," It's 240 Hertz instead of 120, like the one that I'm using,"
4246960,4249040," or it's either 120 or 144."
4249040,4250840," Anyway, it's a little smoother."
4250840,4253080," And a big one is that it would mean"
4253080,4255920," that if I want to start streaming again more regularly,"
4255920,4259080," my camera could be in a way better position."
4259080,4263000," A big, big 16 by 9 monitor is actually not that great"
4263000,4264800," for webcam positioning."
4264800,4268720," Anyway, sorry, talking points, blah, blah, 45-inch,"
4268720,4272000," 1,000-inch peak brightness, three-year warranty"
4272000,4274800," with burn-in protection, and you can check it out"
4274800,4277800," at the link in the video description."
4277800,4280600," OK, that's not creepy at all."
4280600,4283400," Cool."
4283400,4285400," Oh my goodness."
4285400,4286000," Hey, Dan."
4286000,4287680," I'm happy that the spots are back."
4287680,4288880," Hey, Dan."
4288880,4290240," We don't know what to do."
4290240,4291160," Tell us what to do."
4291160,4292280," Tell us what to do."
4292280,4293880," Three merch messages."
4293880,4295760," OK, well, then why didn't you just read a merch message?"
4295760,4296520," Yeah."
4296520,4297200," Dan."
4297200,4298800," Yeah."
4298800,4300640," It's going to be less effective trying to yell at it"
4300640,4301640," when we're in Taiwan."
4301640,4302800," Yeah, that's true."
4302800,4306240," Oh, yeah, next week is going to be the Taiwan show."
4306240,4308920," [LAUGHING]"
4308920,4312440," Why did I think of that?"
4312440,4313600," Yeah, OK, fine."
4313600,4315840," We'll do some merch messages if you insist."
4315840,4319360," OK."
4319360,4322560," Another, Dan, has a question for the talent."
4322560,4324880," LTX is coming soon, and with the way of land,"
4324880,4329120," I would like to hear your tips for traveling with land gear."
4329120,4329640," Oh, man."
4329640,4330680," Take the GPU out."
4330680,4331840," Yeah, it takes the GPU."
4331840,4337600," Never, never put your tower down below if you can avoid it."
4337600,4339120," It's a strong argument for--"
4339120,4341520," Yeah, like in the luggage check."
4341520,4344040," Like if you can small form factor it"
4344040,4346320," and bring your computer with you, man, I would try."
4346320,4347720," I didn't think about flying."
4347720,4352360," But at the very least, take your GPU out of the system,"
4352360,4354080," pack it up with stuff."
4354080,4356200," We did a video."
4356200,4357240," I forgot about this."
4357240,4363880," Linus, how to pack your PC?"
4363880,4366000," Here, hold on a second."
4366000,4368040," How to not smash your PC."
4368040,4370000," Gaming rig, packing, and moving guide."
4370000,4373880," This must have been more than three years ago."
4373880,4375760," Hold on, just a gosh darn second here."
4375760,4377200," What's the exact date on this?"
4377200,4378920," Yeah, July 1, 2019."
4378920,4382440," This was in the lead up to LTX the last time we did it."
4382440,4385280," Look at this hair."
4385280,4387920," And the whole idea was that we were going to be doing a big land"
4387920,4390000," and we wanted people's computers to make it safely."
4390000,4391520," So we show you guys all these ways"
4391520,4394720," that you can pack up your computer safely."
4394720,4396280," Oh, yeah, this stuff is really good."
4396280,4397280," Yeah, yeah."
4397280,4401480," Yeah, so that's a whole video that only got a million views."
4401480,4404120," But hey, I think we just got a nice little bump"
4404120,4407720," from the 500 people who are coming to whale land."
4407720,4408680," Yay."
4408680,4409600," Small bump."
4409600,4410440," Small bump."
4410440,4412000," All right, okay, Dan."
4412000,4414280," DLL, with how much you guys work"
4414280,4416360," when you're lasting four to five hours,"
4416360,4419960," how do you manage a good work/family balance?"
4419960,4427840," Well, I'm supposed to be home already"
4427840,4432080," so that I can spend a bit of time with my wife"
4432080,4433840," before I go to the airport."
4433840,4435680," What time's our flight?"
4435680,4436520," 2 AM."
4436520,4437360," 2 AM."
4437360,4439240," So I fly out in six hours."
4439240,4441480," It's quite a while to get there."
4441480,4443000," It's been a challenge."
4443000,4444000," Yep."
4444000,4448040," But I schedule time for family."
4448040,4453040," So every week I go to my daughter's martial arts class"
4453040,4456640," with them, so I help participate in the class."
4456640,4460560," Also, I do badminton training with my kids."
4460560,4462320," Like I'll play with them."
4463480,4466080," Whether it's like family game night or board games"
4466080,4467440," or movie night or whatever else."
4467440,4469280," You know, we make sure that we do those things"
4469280,4470960," at least a couple times a week when it's swimming"
4470960,4471960," on the weekend."
4471960,4473600," Like you just have to schedule it, I think,"
4473600,4477120," is the typical response you'll hear from busy people."
4477120,4478280," Get it on the schedule."
4478280,4482400," And the funny thing about it is that like,"
4482400,4483520," my parents were super busy,"
4483520,4486800," but I didn't really think about it until I became a parent."
4486800,4488680," Like you remember like, oh yeah,"
4488680,4491480," we would go to, you know, play land"
4491480,4493440," or we would do this or we would do that."
4493440,4496080," And you think back and you go, yeah, we did that like four times."
4496080,4497320," Like kids' memories are funny."
4497320,4499680," And I think my kids think I spend a lot of time with them,"
4499680,4501240," actually. So it's good."
4501240,4505440," You know, bedtime stories, making sure that you kind of"
4505440,4508480," catch them at least once a day and do something with them."
4508480,4509680," I think it's really important."
4509680,4512840," My life is a lot easier."
4512840,4514000," Don't have kids."
4514000,4514920," I do."
4514920,4518280," I am hoping to have someone at a time at home though,"
4518280,4520200," because my birds have been away all week."
4520200,4521680," Have I told you this at all?"
4521680,4522120," No."
4522120,4524560," OK, so when I was in Houston doing one of the coolest things"
4524560,4527120," that I've ever done in my darn life,"
4527120,4529360," we boarded the birds at the vet."
4529360,4533520," It's pretty common for people to board their birds at vets"
4533520,4534440," when they go away."
4534440,4537000," Is it common for the vet to not bother taking care"
4537000,4537800," of their birds at all?"
4537800,4538840," Yeah."
4538840,4541400," So there's a continuation of that story."
4541400,4543840," Oh, they have mites."
4543840,4545040," Your birds have mites."
4545040,4546440," That they got?"
4546440,4547360," Are you sure?"
4547360,4548160," At the vet."
4549680,4551720," OK, I shouldn't joke."
4551720,4553120," I mean, I'm too pissed to find it funny."
4553120,4555600," It was pretty good, but I'm very angry right now."
4555600,4556400," So it didn't--"
4556400,4558360," Seriously, they have vet mites."
4558360,4562600," Yeah, so we contacted the vet and they were like, oh, yeah."
4562600,4565320," So we had our second infestation of mites"
4565320,4568440," ever in our entire history and they've been around"
4568440,4569480," for a very long time."
4569480,4570000," Yeah."
4570000,4573520," This is like the worst ever and things are bad."
4573520,4575640," Bring them back and we'll take care of them."
4575640,4579840," Scoop the blue and white one was anemic."
4579840,4581320," And birds are-- you know what?"
4581320,4582560," Humans are mostly water."
4582560,4583560," Birds mostly air."
4583560,4585080," They have like no mass to them."
4585080,4585560," Right."
4585560,4587960," So if it's anemic--"
4587960,4588640," That's really bad."
4588640,4589720," Real bad."
4589720,4591880," And they took such good care of your birds last time."
4591880,4593920," So big concern."
4593920,4597960," And they're probably home right now, actually."
4597960,4598520," OK."
4598520,4600280," I'm hoping to see them for some amount of time"
4600280,4602280," before we leave."
4602280,4604920," Because I am a big squishy man that"
4604920,4609600," wants to see little tiny borb before I go away for two weeks."
4609600,4610400," You're a good bird, dad."
4610400,4613320," [LAUGHTER]"
4613320,4614000," Yeah."
4614000,4616640," I don't think I could be as attached to a bird as you"
4616640,4617640," seem to be to your birds."
4617640,4618000," It helps."
4618000,4618880," I don't have kids."
4618880,4619320," Yeah."
4619320,4621400," Well, it's one of those things where--"
4621400,4622040," oh, boy."
4622040,4623960," This is going to be a hot day."
4623960,4625600," And we should do the next merch message."
4625600,4630120," As a parent, I often hear people, you know, like dog people"
4630120,4633840," and bird people talk about how much it's like kids."
4633840,4634320," Oh, no."
4634320,4638360," And I'm just like, nope, it's an animal."
4638360,4641960," You feel that way because you don't have kids."
4641960,4645560," I thought I loved cats a lot."
4645560,4650480," And now I'm like, oh, no, it's just a cat."
4650480,4651320," OK."
4651320,4652960," I mean, I like my cats."
4652960,4654240," And you can care about them all."
4654240,4658200," Maybe love them a little, but it's not the same."
4658200,4661480," And then I actually have this conversation often."
4661480,4662920," And I'm like, no, they're cool."
4662920,4664320," I care about them a lot."
4664320,4665560," I will do a lot for them."
4665560,4668640," But you only have that much energy for your dog,"
4668640,4669760," because--"
4669760,4674200," yeah, no, it's just a dog."
4674200,4675440," I'm sorry."
4675440,4677520," And dogs are cool."
4677520,4678040," Super cool."
4678040,4679280," My birds are fantastic."
4679280,4679840," Yep."
4679840,4680400," Love my cats."
4680400,4685240," And we went through a lot-- OK."
4685240,4686520," Here's the fun part."
4686520,4688880," You'll know how much I liked doing this."
4688880,4693800," They sent us this huge PDF about like, OK, so you had mites,"
4693800,4696360," because now we had mites in our house."
4696360,4697520," And we found them--"
4697520,4699120," my girlfriend found them-- because they were crawling"
4699120,4701440," on the blanket."
4701440,4703440," So they're not just on the birds."
4703440,4704960," They're not just in the cage."
4704960,4707200," They are now in our house."
4707200,4709280," So it's like, this is how you deal with things."
4709280,4710360," Now that you have mites in your house,"
4710360,4712480," and they're like, you will effectively never"
4712480,4714560," get rid of this infestation."
4714560,4716000," Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
4716000,4717520," Some of the reasons why are they'll"
4717520,4721960," get into your couch, and you can't get them out of your couch."
4721960,4722440," Guess what?"
4722440,4725960," My response was, let's see how well--"
4725960,4727680," mine is going to usually pin me pretty well,"
4727680,4728960," but this one was interesting."
4728960,4730480," So we'll see."
4730480,4734000," To get rid of mites?"
4734000,4735880," Arson."
4735880,4737920," Because you can't get it out of certain things."
4737920,4738360," So like--"
4738360,4739320," Well, yeah, the new--"
4739320,4741760," Mite computer chair is right next to the cage."
4741760,4743680," They sit literally right here."
4743680,4746480," The couch is literally right on the other side of that."
4746480,4747800," The solution to this."
4747800,4749840," There's a carpet that was right beside them as well."
4749840,4753440," I mean, no, you have to have just hauled it out immediately."
4753440,4753880," Yep."
4753880,4754400," Yeah."
4754400,4757600," I've yeeted my couch, my computer chair, and my giant carpet."
4757600,4758640," Thanks, vet."
4758640,4761480," So you walk into my house, and it echoes now."
4761480,4762360," Right."
4762360,4766520," Like I actually yeeted half of the furniture that I own."
4766520,4768000," And I'm going to leave on this trip"
4768000,4770640," and come back and have no computer chair."
4770640,4771400," Sick."
4771400,4772840," I have like a dining room chair."
4772840,4773440," I'll be fine."
4773440,4775520," But like--"
4775520,4776480," What a pain in the butt."
4776480,4778800," Oh my god, I'm so annoyed."
4778800,4779320," Get it?"
4779320,4780320," Anyways."
4780320,4781720," Pain in the-- ah-ha."
4781720,4782880," Good one."
4782880,4787120," OK, I get a courtesy chuckle for that one."
4787120,4787840," This is great."
4787840,4788960," Get rid of that, that's until you?"
4788960,4789920," Bro."
4789920,4791000," Bro."
4791000,4795360," I think I'm going to start implementing my shadow banning."
4795360,4797160," I got a Twitch message."
4797160,4799000," Loving a self-reproduction of yourself"
4799000,4801360," is the height of hubris."
4801360,4806080," That is actually not what a kid is."
4806080,4807720," You're a f*cking idiot."
4807720,4810040," Miniature Linus Cloned."
4810040,4813680," Like actually-- like actually your brain is bad."
4813680,4821880," It's like you can't have that bad of a take"
4821880,4824240," because your brain couldn't possibly"
4824240,4829360," get there from a place of being remotely functional"
4829360,4831720," without it actually being real."
4831720,4833520," Like that's kind of how it works."
4833520,4838840," Oh my god."
4838840,4844880," Next message."
4844880,4845720," Is it how many more--"
4845720,4847880," Please move on or we won't be."
4847880,4849000," We will not have enough time."
4849000,4849680," You got 10 minutes."
4849680,4850640," You got me again."
4850640,4853080," Eight sleeps, should we talk about that?"
4853080,4853600," Yeah."
4853600,4854600," We got to talk about it some point."
4854600,4857160," Some viewers were upset that eight sleep, who sponsored"
4857160,4860320," a video last week, requires a mandatory subscription."
4860320,4861720," I do want to put an asterisk on here"
4861720,4863880," because I've talked about eight sleep on the show a few times"
4863880,4866000," about how I have one and how I like it a lot."
4866000,4868720," I'm 99.9% sure it was not a mandatory subscription."
4868720,4869960," No, we can talk about that."
4869960,4870800," It is--"
4870800,4873160," Yeah, no, but I bought mine back then."
4873160,4876200," So it requires a mandatory subscription"
4876200,4879000," for at least a year to their premium features."
4879000,4881240," And it's really expensive, just as a note,"
4881240,4883840," to their premium features with the purchase of their temperature"
4883840,4886120," controlled mattress topper."
4886120,4891080," The product's super basic feature, heating/cooling,"
4891080,4892600," works without the subscription."
4892600,4894480," There's nothing forcing users to continue"
4894480,4896560," to buy it after the first year."
4896560,4898560," Our request, eight sleep, has agreed"
4898560,4902360," to double their discount offer from $150 to $300"
4902360,4904120," to cover the cost of the subscription."
4904120,4906640," And we've let them know that we won't be working with them"
4906640,4909560," moving forward unless they make changes to their subscription"
4909560,4912720," model and commit to an open source transition,"
4912720,4915160," should the company go out of business."
4915160,4917360," Hopefully that helps address things with you guys."
4917360,4919080," I got to be honest with you, the reason"
4919080,4921640," that I didn't know this was a problem"
4921640,4924520," is because I'm using my eight sleep topper"
4924520,4926800," without a subscription, because I looked"
4926800,4929000," at the features of the subscription"
4929000,4931000," and what I wanted it for."
4931000,4934040," And I went, eh, not really worth it."
4934040,4935880," And it was optional back then."
4935880,4939840," And I didn't realize that you had to buy the year of subscription."
4939840,4942760," Honestly, I think they could have just messaged this better."
4942760,4946280," If the price was just higher and it included"
4946280,4947760," the first year of subscription."
4947760,4950360," - Including free, like that's exactly."
4950360,4952000," - Then I don't think anybody would have,"
4952000,4954680," the people would have said it was expensive,"
4954680,4958560," but they wouldn't have called it evil or predatory"
4958560,4960120," or whatever else."
4960120,4962040," - 'Cause it is really expensive."
4962040,4964040," With or without the subscription, whatever,"
4964040,4964920," it is very expensive."
4964920,4967080," - Yeah, it's very expensive."
4967080,4971520," But hey, thanks eight sleep for dealing with it"
4971520,4973520," in terms of how the discount code works."
4973520,4974680," - The school, they did that."
4974680,4978560," - And hopefully these guys will make a commitment"
4978560,4981560," to ensure that these things don't turn into,"
4981560,4986040," you know, just 35 pounds of just e-waste"
4986040,4988480," if the company were to ever go out of business."
4988480,4990520," But that said, given how much their subscription costs,"
4990520,4991800," I think it'd be a real challenge for them"
4991800,4993400," to go out of business."
4993400,4998400," But as expensive as it is, like, I like the product."
4999280,5002360," And a lot of people were posting misinformation too though."
5002360,5004160," They were saying that without the subscription,"
5004160,5005760," you can't use the app."
5005760,5007960," That is not true. - That's correct, yeah."
5007960,5009640," - I do not have-- - It just doesn't do"
5009640,5012440," auto-pilot, which is the auto-adjusting feature, right?"
5012440,5014080," - I don't have a subscription."
5014080,5016320," My phone is almost dead, so you can barely see"
5016320,5018320," my battery saver screen or whatever."
5018320,5021680," But this is my dashboard."
5021680,5023560," - That's rough. - My temp dial."
5023560,5024520," My temp dial."
5024520,5026440," - I get that almost every day as well."
5026440,5028000," - Definitely works."
5028000,5029880," - Oh, oh, my sleep attention. - Hey, attention, yeah."
5029880,5031440," - Score of 26. - Yeah."
5031440,5036440," - Yeah, well, I mean-- - What do you want from me?"
5036440,5039760," - It's mine. - Yeah, I don't sleep well."
5039760,5042440," But anyway, yeah, my temp dial works"
5042440,5045720," and it will adjust throughout the night,"
5045720,5048000," but it doesn't adjust based on my body temperature."
5048000,5050800," So I just have to kind of dial it into what I like."
5050800,5053560," And the challenge there is that if you are not"
5053560,5055680," in a temperature controlled space,"
5055680,5058200," like my house has climate control, right?"
5058200,5059880," If you're not in a temperature controlled space,"
5059880,5061280," then it could be a lot more important"
5061280,5062720," to have the automatic thing."
5062720,5065960," But then presumably you aren't paying for climate control."
5065960,5071200," So I see why people were upset"
5071200,5072880," and that's why we've gone to them and said,"
5072880,5074960," okay, look, here's our list of demands,"
5074960,5077240," but I also do see the value of the product."
5077240,5078080," It's not..."
5078080,5081440," - Oh, I've actually done pretty good lately."
5081440,5082560," I've got you beat."
5082560,5084000," - 74. - Wow."
5084000,5085080," - That's very good for me."
5085080,5086240," - Wow, good job, Luke."
5086240,5087120," - Thank you."
5087120,5090320," - For the last five days,"
5090320,5095320," I have a sleep score of 26, 41, 80, 37, 44."
5095320,5102080," And I have a full 100 from last Sunday."
5102080,5102920," - Dio."
5102920,5106000," - Dio. - Yeah."
5106000,5106980," That's pretty good."
5106980,5111520," Man, I slept till like 11.30 though."
5111520,5113800," So that's, yeah, that explains that."
5114640,5116960," My kids let me sleep in that day."
5116960,5120400," What do you wanna talk about next?"
5120400,5121280," - Oh, right."
5121280,5123280," We should also talk about that other sponsor,"
5123280,5126040," Snafu this week on Tech Quickie,"
5126040,5130640," where we had that sponsor that was like a neck cooler thing."
5130640,5131600," - Oh, I heard about this."
5131600,5132880," - Okay."
5132880,5133920," I tried it."
5133920,5137440," It's like kind of cool, pun intended."
5137440,5139480," - But..."
5139480,5140600," - It's a Kickstarter, right, or something?"
5140600,5143920," - Yeah, so that I didn't know."
5143920,5148080," So I've reiterated to the team,"
5148080,5150840," hey, we can't really do Kickstarter, Indiegogo stuff."
5150840,5152880," However, the reason they let it through"
5152880,5155080," is not entirely stupid either."
5155080,5157800," This is a company that basically uses"
5157800,5161920," crowdfunding campaigns as a marketing vehicle."
5161920,5166320," So you know how even though we don't talk about products"
5166320,5167880," on Indiegogo or whatever,"
5167880,5169960," but I'm constantly covering I and EO?"
5170960,5174160," Well, their product development just happens anyway."
5174160,5175000," - Yes."
5175000,5175840," - And they use..."
5175840,5177400," - It's almost like marketing at that point."
5177400,5181360," - So this company has also got a very similar history"
5181360,5183800," of just releasing products"
5183800,5186680," via crowdfunding campaign as a marketing vehicle."
5186680,5188640," So that's why they made the call."
5188640,5190120," But the issue here, I think,"
5190120,5193400," was that they were a very random company"
5193400,5196320," that our viewers were not familiar with at all,"
5196320,5199760," and therefore didn't have that trust built up at all."
5199760,5201760," And so we got a fair amount of pushback on that,"
5201760,5203040," and rightly so."
5203040,5206360," Also, the talking points were stupid."
5206360,5208320," And I talked to the business team about that as well."
5208320,5209680," Like one of the talking points was"
5209680,5212120," that the fan is AI controlled."
5212120,5214920," And I'm like, if your fan is AI controlled,"
5214920,5219000," you did it wrong because you're powering an AI processor"
5219000,5222560," in your like neck cooler"
5222560,5224720," that should probably be using that power"
5224720,5226560," for cooling your neck"
5226560,5229360," and just have a simple fan curve on it, right?"
5230320,5233400," So I talked to them about how we can't just"
5233400,5236080," take silly talking points at face value."
5236080,5238600," We have to make sure that we are communicating things"
5238600,5241280," in a way that is representative of the actual product."
5241280,5242480," What does the product do?"
5242480,5244680," It cools your neck."
5244680,5248740," It kind of feels like having like a chili water bottle"
5248740,5250760," around your neck like this."
5250760,5252280," You know what?"
5252280,5253120," I like it."
5253120,5256720," Is it going to be the difference between,"
5256720,5259400," going out in 45 Celsius heat"
5259400,5261640," and being immediately comfortable?"
5261640,5263880," I think it's fair if it's a company"
5263880,5265160," without a proven track record"
5265160,5267160," and it's a Kickstarter,"
5267160,5270080," Indiegogo level pre-order."
5270080,5271080," I think that part's fair,"
5271080,5273080," but like you said, you didn't know it was that."
5273080,5273920," I don't know."
5273920,5278080," So yeah, I mean, I only found out about this"
5278080,5280240," after it was already a controversy."
5280240,5281680," But I think, you know what?"
5281680,5283720," Things like this are gonna happen more and more."
5283720,5286840," And I'm just gonna have to kind of get used to it."
5286840,5288240," As chief vision officer,"
5288240,5290400," I'm probably gonna end up running damage control"
5290400,5292840," more often as opposed to less often"
5292840,5296040," if part of the goal here is for me to not be like"
5296040,5298600," hour by hour involved in absolutely everything"
5298600,5299640," that this company does."
5299640,5301440," 'Cause it's just, it's not possible anymore."
5301440,5303360," Theoretically, hopefully we have less though."
5303360,5304920," Like for a change,"
5304920,5307880," hold on, what were the two controversies?"
5307880,5309520," There was the eight, okay, the eight sleep one,"
5309520,5310680," I had something to do with,"
5310680,5312440," but I didn't know all the details."
5312440,5314160," And to the business team's credit,"
5314160,5316600," they did tell me that there was some kind of controversy"
5316600,5317800," around the subscription."
5317800,5319520," And I waved it away because I kind of went,"
5319520,5320840," well yeah, but like, I don't know,"
5320840,5323040," I use it without the subscription, who cares?"
5323040,5325040," Whoops, right?"
5325040,5328160," But then this other one with the weird net cooler thing,"
5328160,5330000," I actually didn't know anything about it"
5330000,5331440," until the whole thing was done."
5331440,5337400," And I'm just gonna have to like get used to it, I guess."
5337400,5339240," - Yeah."
5339240,5340480," - So we're gonna make some mistakes."
5340480,5341880," - We had this conversation."
5341880,5346880," - Yeah, I was talking about this thing that we're implementing"
5346880,5349520," and security issues around it"
5349520,5351920," and like who should be able to have what level of access"
5351920,5353720," to various things if you're not."
5353720,5357960," And she was kind of just thinking out loud"
5357960,5362200," about how it's interesting and in some ways difficult,"
5362200,5363560," but in some ways good, whatever."
5363560,5365400," Like just kind of thinking out loud"
5365400,5368480," about the idea that it's not always just"
5368480,5372320," the minus of on run everything all the time anymore."
5372320,5375920," - It's weird."
5375920,5376760," - We can't."
5376760,5377600," - Yeah."
5377600,5378440," - It's not possible."
5378440,5379280," - Nope."
5379280,5380520," - Just like, I don't like almost 120 people."
5380520,5382960," We added like two more people on Monday."
5382960,5384280," Like what?"
5384280,5385120," - Yeah."
5385120,5388800," - The Monday morning meeting like always has a picture"
5388800,5391120," in it these days, like always."
5391120,5394360," - Well you're not helping."
5394360,5395200," - No."
5395200,5396200," - Mine were all pre-approved bro."
5396200,5397240," Mine were all pre-approved."
5397240,5398240," Like last year."
5398240,5401560," - I don't deny it."
5401560,5405400," Should we talk about the invisible PC setup?"
5405400,5408480," - Yes, yes."
5408480,5415640," - Invisible mouse, invisible keyboard, hologram monitor."
5415640,5420480," This channel is actually amazing."
5420480,5423480," - This is the only thing I've seen, but it was awesome."
5423480,5424320," - And I."
5424320,5426400," - Oh no, he did this like super tiny one too"
5426400,5428840," and specifically called me out to beat it."
5428840,5430280," And I was like, I can't."
5430280,5431120," - What am I gonna do?"
5431120,5434120," - You've taken this to completely end game."
5434120,5435320," - You have gone too far."
5435320,5438440," - Yeah, this was sick."
5438440,5443160," I actually didn't even know that's kind of funny."
5443160,5446240," I didn't know this was gonna be in the dock."
5446240,5450000," I watched like a short, I think, on it."
5450000,5452560," And then was like, man, I wish I could see the whole thing."
5452560,5454560," So now I need to watch the whole video."
5455400,5458320," - Okay, I see."
5458320,5461080," - So yeah, the keyboard's like embedded in the table."
5461080,5464160," But there isn't a mouse, which is interesting"
5464160,5465000," because he--"
5465000,5465840," - Yeah, there's products like that."
5465840,5468480," - He could have used the same technology for the keyboard."
5468480,5470400," But I actually am happy that he didn't"
5470400,5473280," because there are limitations to it."
5473280,5475240," - Right."
5475240,5477280," (laughs)"
5477280,5480200," - Adjustable sense, oh my goodness."
5480200,5481040," - This is amazing."
5481040,5483040," - That looks so insane."
5484360,5485720," - Absolutely next to Jim."
5485720,5488280," - That looks like something from like a movie"
5488280,5491760," on like Future Tech and AI from like the early 2000s."
5491760,5492600," - Yeah."
5492600,5494120," - You know, where they fake it."
5494120,5495240," But he actually did it."
5495240,5496840," - Yeah, you guys are gonna have to watch this."
5496840,5497680," - Crazy."
5497680,5499720," You should absolutely check it out."
5499720,5501520," - That's super cool."
5501520,5503080," All the stuff that's embedded in here,"
5503080,5504920," the zero gram invisible mouse."
5504920,5506840," I love the gaming memes."
5506840,5508760," Fantastic."
5508760,5510000," Wow."
5510000,5511680," Okay, I'm going to have to--"
5511680,5512520," - Super cool."
5512520,5515880," - Can we, can people post the link to that in chat or something?"
5515880,5516720," - Yeah, of course."
5516720,5517920," Oh, I mean, I can just do it."
5517920,5518760," - Cool."
5518760,5519600," - Yeah, yeah."
5519600,5520440," People are asking for the link."
5520440,5521280," - Yeah, yeah, yeah."
5521280,5522200," Don't worry, I got you guys."
5522200,5523320," I got you guys."
5523320,5524200," Basically homeless."
5524200,5527040," Go check out the super tiny one as well."
5527040,5529120," - I gotta watch more of his stuff"
5529120,5530040," 'cause that was really,"
5530040,5532760," - Yeah, one of those channels like DIY perks where like,"
5532760,5534800," he doesn't publish that much."
5534800,5536640," So it's easy."
5536640,5538800," - I freaking love DIY perks."
5538800,5540160," - Or like, glasses like that."
5540160,5541000," - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah."
5541000,5544120," Whereas it's like, they're not prolific publishers."
5544120,5544960," Like we are."
5544960,5546520," - But every time they drop, it's a banger."
5546520,5547920," - It's a banger."
5547920,5549400," It's a banger."
5549400,5551920," YouTube chat."
5551920,5553400," I bet it's a poor experience."
5553400,5556600," - That is not the point."
5556600,5561360," - This is why I never look at YouTube chat."
5561360,5563880," (laughing)"
5563880,5567120," - That actual Unwashed Masses JK Love You YouTube Chat."
5567120,5569640," At least you're not as bad as Twitch chat."
5569640,5571000," There you go, boom, Rusty."
5571000,5571840," - Got 'em."
5571840,5572680," - Okay."
5572680,5577120," - Rip Cortana, do we only have one after dark?"
5577120,5578880," We have five minutes."
5578880,5579840," - Okay."
5579840,5582080," The National Eating Disorders Association"
5582080,5585720," replaced their helpline with a chatbot."
5585720,5590320," They've replaced all hotline workers and volunteers"
5590320,5595320," with a chatbot four days after the workers voted to unionize."
5595320,5599320," If you thought AI is not coming for my job,"
5599960,5603600," and you worked for the National Eating Disorders Association,"
5603600,5604520," you no longer think that."
5604520,5607280," - You were objectively incorrect."
5607280,5610360," This is absolutely mind blowing."
5610360,5614960," And this is the leading edge."
5614960,5618800," This is the tip of the wave that's coming."
5618800,5621280," The hotline workers included a handful of paid staff"
5621280,5623600," as well as around 200 volunteers."
5623600,5626960," The employees demands did not include pay raises."
5626960,5630360," They asked for higher staffing levels and ongoing training"
5630360,5633120," to deal with staff burnout and ballooning wait times."
5633120,5639880," Neda has used the chatbot called Tessa since February of 2022."
5639880,5642400," It is not based on chat GPT"
5642400,5645080," and does not make decisions or grow."
5645080,5647360," It follows predetermined pathways"
5647360,5650000," based on the knowledge of the researchers who made it."
5650000,5651480," - So this is an old school chatbot."
5651480,5653920," I went into this assuming it was an AI chatbot."
5653920,5655400," This is an old school chatbot."
5655400,5656640," Like the thing that helped you with your--"
5656640,5658760," - Is that better? - Your Lego thing."
5658760,5660720," Probably better because like, okay."
5660720,5661920," - At least it won't hallucinate."
5661920,5662760," - Yes."
5662760,5664440," The reason why I freaked out about this"
5664440,5666720," was remember when we had that conversation forever ago"
5666720,5669600," about the AI that convinced the dude to kill himself"
5669600,5670920," so he could join them or whatever."
5670920,5673240," I was worried that type of stuff would happen."
5673240,5677760," But it like won't happen with this type of system."
5677760,5681640," - Yeah, but while many users have rated the bot as helpful,"
5681640,5684840," its creator has stated that it is not an adequate replacement."
5684840,5686520," - For a human staff to help them."
5686520,5688040," - Yeah, so that all sounds right."
5688040,5690480," - Man."
5690480,5694160," - Helpline volunteers were asked to act as testers"
5694160,5697840," for the chatbot instead of providing one-on-one support"
5697840,5698680," to callers."
5698680,5702720," - 70,000 people last year."
5702720,5703560," Wow."
5703560,5705400," So wait, what actually happened?"
5705400,5706800," 'Cause it said they did this, yeah,"
5706800,5709160," but they've been doing this since February 2022."
5709160,5712480," So did they do this back in February 2022"
5712480,5713840," or what changed?"
5714560,5717640," - No, no, they've just had it."
5717640,5719840," Now it's just all that's available."
5719840,5721160," - So they just dropped everybody."
5721160,5722280," - Yeah, see you later."
5722280,5723120," Wow."
5723120,5726120," This is kind of wild."
5726120,5729440," The Google Play Store has suspended the app Downloader,"
5729440,5733000," a popular app for sideloading on Android TV"
5733000,5737800," following a DMCA takedown from several Israeli TV companies"
5737800,5740560," who complained that the app is capable"
5740560,5742840," of loading piracy websites."
5743840,5747240," Yeah, that face is about how you should be feeling"
5747240,5748800," about this right now."
5748800,5752080," Downloader is essentially a combination of a web browser"
5752080,5754720," and file manager that allows Android TV owners"
5754720,5756560," to easily download files from the internet"
5756560,5758120," onto their device."
5758120,5760920," It can display piracy websites, yes,"
5760920,5764880," but only to the same degree that any other web browser"
5764880,5766920," can display piracy websites."
5766920,5770160," - So they need to remove Chrome from the Play Store."
5770160,5773560," - Yeah, the specific piracy site that was noted"
5773560,5776600," in the complaint, Siderot, I don't know,"
5776600,5779680," has received injunctions from Israeli and US federal courts."
5779680,5781640," However, it is still online"
5781640,5785040," and can still be accessed in Google Chrome."
5785040,5787760," Prior to the takedown,"
5787760,5790520," Downloader had been downloaded over 5 million times."
5790520,5791960," Yo, dog, I heard you like downloading,"
5791960,5793280," so I put a downloader in your download,"
5793280,5794720," it doesn't matter."
5794720,5797360," Google has rejected the developer's appeal"
5797360,5798880," to reverse the decision."
5798880,5800920," It's still available on the Amazon App Store"
5800920,5802960," and the developer's own website,"
5802960,5804480," where you can sideload it, I guess,"
5804480,5809480," but if it's for sideloading, can we just stop"
5809480,5813040," letting tech illiterate people make legal decisions"
5813040,5813680," about tech?"
5813680,5815280," Is that something we can do?"
5815280,5816840," Do we have that power?"
5816840,5818840," (sighs)"
5818840,5822280," Then again, you let big tech be in charge of it"
5822280,5824240," and they're just gonna walk all over everybody anyway."
5824240,5825120," It's not gonna be better."
5825120,5825960," - Yep."
5825960,5826880," (groans)"
5826880,5827720," - Yep."
5828720,5831280," - Oh man, that's really stupid."
5831280,5835080," - Like, how many points did your IQ drop?"
5835080,5836560," Just hearing this."
5836560,5838320," - What was remaining?"
5838320,5839160," I'll say."
5839160,5842880," Let's move on, we don't have that much time."
5842880,5843720," - Yeah, fine."
5843720,5844960," - We have any time for the talker."
5844960,5845800," - We're talking about the talker."
5845800,5848080," - Was arrested for posting, monetizing,"
5848080,5850880," and posting and monetizing copyrighted content."
5850880,5853240," The 52-year-old YouTuber was accused"
5853240,5855800," of uploading and monetizing a playthrough"
5855800,5859960," of the visual novel Steinsgate, My Darling's Embrace,"
5859960,5862120," a romantic comedy dating sim"
5862120,5864120," without permission from the developer."
5864120,5866520," They had likewise posted videos that contained footage"
5866520,5868400," from anime series."
5868400,5869600," These were not full episodes."
5869600,5872160," They were narrated summaries condensing the material,"
5872160,5875320," which is a popular video genre in Japan."
5875320,5878680," A primary point of contention was the relatively long duration"
5878680,5881160," of the videos and the fact that they contained the game's"
5881160,5883240," ending, meaning that they might act as a replacement"
5883240,5884120," for the original material."
5884120,5886200," Seriously, arrested."
5886200,5889800," - Bad precedent."
5889800,5890640," - Yeah."
5890640,5895120," And this kind of seems to explain why Nintendo doesn't"
5895120,5901080," understand how the entire rest of the world views fair use"
5901080,5902760," because my understanding is fair use,"
5902760,5905160," like kinda doesn't really exist there, is that?"
5905160,5907440," Like at least not in the same way that it does here."
5907440,5909360," - I have no idea, but I don't think so."
5909360,5912120," I have also heard some pretty intense arguments"
5912120,5915400," against people streaming or making Let's Plays"
5915400,5917680," or whatever of visual novels specifically."
5917680,5918560," Is that what this was?"
5918560,5919400," - Yeah."
5919400,5920240," - I was reading some, yeah."
5920240,5923760," - Oh no, romantic comedy dating sim, but yeah."
5923760,5924600," - Oh."
5924600,5926720," - I thought it was."
5926720,5929200," - Seems to be very story driven."
5929200,5931480," - Yeah, okay, so I'm gonna go on a tangent, I guess,"
5931480,5933720," and just say for visual novels specifically,"
5933720,5935840," 'cause this is a thing on like Steam and stuff,"
5935840,5937200," people have been pretty against it"
5937200,5940600," because you're basically live streaming,"
5940600,5942800," flipping the pages in a book,"
5942800,5944800," and you're showing all the pages in the book."
5944800,5945640," - Right."
5945640,5949160," - Like they're actually is not any other content."
5949160,5952280," You're not playing the game, right?"
5952280,5954120," So I don't know, this one sounds like it's not that,"
5954120,5956560," but that's just like, I know that's an argument"
5956560,5957400," that's going on."
5957400,5959120," - Jake from the lab who I think lived over there"
5959120,5961840," for a few years says this is an interesting one"
5961840,5965840," as Japanese copyright law dictates that the owners need"
5965840,5967760," to aggressively defend their copyright,"
5967760,5970120," kind of like how trademark laws work here."
5970120,5972840," So this may not actually be something"
5972840,5975600," that the developer necessarily wants to do,"
5975600,5978160," but if they wanna keep their copyright, that's it."
5978160,5982680," - Oh, seriously, Activision shuts down"
5982680,5985160," community run servers for LegacyCOD."
5985160,5986920," See you later."
5986920,5988680," Sees and desists from Activision."
5988680,5991240," - Yeah, so the problem is that those community servers"
5991240,5993120," were the only safe way to play those games"
5993120,5995800," because Activision is not keeping their own servers"
5995800,5996680," up to date."
5996680,6001680," So you can attack people through Activision servers"
6001680,6003880," 'cause they're not secure."
6003880,6006080," I don't know all the details, but I know it's like bad."
6006080,6007960," - And they implemented their own antique sheet,"
6007960,6008720," which is super cool."
6008720,6010880," This is for the original modern warfare too."
6010880,6012680," - Yeah, it's like way better."
6012680,6015040," - A possible cause for their legal action"
6015040,6017360," is the fact that one of XLAB's setup guides"
6017360,6019840," contained a link to an illegal copy of the game."
6019840,6020760," - Well, that's bad."
6020760,6023240," - But then they should have just said take that down."
6023240,6024080," - Yeah."
6024080,6026320," - But then I can see why they don't wanna micromanage this."
6026320,6028080," - Yep, yeah, I shouldn't have done that."
6028080,6030400," - So the modern warfare two steam pages"
6030400,6031840," seen a wave of negative reviews"
6031840,6034280," claiming that the game can no longer be safely played."
6034280,6035320," - That's true."
6035320,6037320," - Discussion questions, \"Is there a way for companies"
6037320,6039760," to defend their IP while allowing the community"
6039760,6042000," to take over old games if they're no longer interested"
6042000,6042840," in maintaining them?\""
6042840,6046720," Yes, there is sort of because with Supreme Commander,"
6046720,6050120," which is super cool, the way that FA Forever exists,"
6050120,6053000," that was an IP that was no longer actively being developed"
6053000,6055600," whereas Call of Duty is."
6055600,6062320," So it's all fine and good as long as this XLAB's version"
6062320,6065600," of the server is good and nobody is getting infected"
6065600,6069480," or whatever, but as soon as they make a mistake,"
6069480,6071040," well, whose liability is that?"
6071040,6073840," - Yeah, but then it should be,"
6073840,6077400," it gets a messy topic."
6077400,6078240," - It's hairy."
6078240,6079440," - But they should not,"
6080880,6084200," there should be some form of recourse for them selling"
6084200,6089200," old games at full fat price that are unplayable safely."
6089200,6091960," - Well, yeah."
6091960,6094960," - For massively extended periods of time."
6094960,6097800," - I think you get like three bucks in your class action"
6097800,6098640," payout."
6098640,6099480," - Yeah."
6099480,6101600," - Yep."
6101600,6102680," - It just never matters."
6102680,6106080," - And YouTube killed stories."
6106080,6108360," I am never getting a stories function"
6108360,6110640," on my foldable device"
6110640,6113200," because YouTube turned off the feature"
6113200,6116040," or is turning it off June 26th."
6116040,6119200," That is the last date and apparently it's because"
6119200,6120640," almost no one uses them."
6120640,6123440," I mean, they got a lot of views back when, you know,"
6123440,6126520," they were a thing, but they want people to use community"
6126520,6128520," posts which appear to be gaining traction"
6128520,6130600," and upload shorts."
6130600,6131680," So there you have it."
6131680,6134160," I'm never getting stories and I guess that's okay"
6134160,6135800," because it didn't really matter,"
6135800,6137400," except that there were some really cool things"
6137400,6138720," you could do with stories."
6138720,6140880," Like replying to comments with a story."
6140880,6142840," Sometimes it's not convenient to type out a thing"
6142840,6144440," on my phone and I'd like to just,"
6144440,6147320," I had pitch to them, hey, how about expanding stories"
6147320,6149440," so that it's a feature that exists more like"
6149440,6151800," in the comments under a video?"
6151800,6154920," So, you know, a comment that got a lot of upvotes."
6154920,6157880," I'd be able to just click a button in my creator app"
6157880,6159280," and record a quick response to it"
6159280,6160160," and it could just live there."
6160160,6162480," Like there are absolutely cool ways"
6162480,6164560," that you could use stories and I think that YouTube"
6164560,6167040," is throwing the baby out with the bathwater here a little bit."
6167040,6169480," But hey, that's the Google way."
6169480,6175760," Let's create two different kinds of short video"
6175760,6178800," and they'll compete against each other"
6178800,6181200," but one of them is monetizable."
6181200,6183240," So that one's gone."
6183240,6184600," Definitely the one that's gonna win."
6184600,6188600," Yeah, go the team."
6188600,6192120," The number of times that they assured me"
6192120,6194360," that they were probably gonna be merged"
6194360,6196240," and that story wasn't going away"
6196240,6197800," and that they were definitely bringing,"
6197800,6201840," the number of YouTube employees who have told me soon"
6201840,6205500," for that feature on my phone is at least three."
6205500,6209800," Not gonna name them, it doesn't matter, it's over."
6209800,6212840," But it's at least three and you know who you are."
6212840,6218600," The last thing I wanna talk about is our 45,000 watt fan."
6218600,6221160," Okay, think about that number."
6221160,6222000," Yeah, I know."
6222000,6225560," 45,000 watts."
6225560,6227600," Yeah, I've seen it."
6227600,6228840," Did you see it in operation?"
6228840,6231680," No, how long was it in operation?"
6231680,6232840," Scary."
6232840,6238360," Probably a total of about 10, 15 minutes."
6238360,6239240," Oh wow."
6239240,6242000," Because that's as long as we can power it for."
6242000,6242840," Yeah."
6242840,6246000," It actually draws so much power"
6246000,6248200," that we could not safely power it"
6248200,6252560," with the entire output of the transformer in that unit."
6253400,6255480," (laughs)"
6255480,6257560," That's so insane."
6257560,6258560," I'm just like."
6258560,6261160," What the heck?"
6261160,6263520," It generates so much thrust"
6263520,6266560," that it could almost hover with me sitting on it."
6266560,6268640," (laughs)"
6268640,6271000," Wow."
6271000,6273840," It's gonna be a fun video."
6273840,6275520," Do you know what they're used for?"
6275520,6277440," I don't know."
6277440,6279560," Oh, we probably should've talked about that."
6279560,6280400," (laughs)"
6280400,6281560," Whoops."
6281560,6284560," Well, maybe, okay, they have a bigger one."
6284560,6287880," So maybe we'll talk about what they're whoring the sequel."
6287880,6288720," Okay."
6288720,6292000," But we cool a computer with it, obviously."
6292000,6293040," Yeah."
6293040,6295160," I am genuinely interested to see what happens"
6295160,6297200," to the components or what you guys did to make it"
6297200,6298600," so that things wouldn't happen to them."
6298600,6299440," Yeah, Alex."
6299440,6300280," Either one of them."
6300280,6301640," Alex and Kyle were involved, so you know what's gonna be--"
6301640,6302800," Oh, I'm sure it's awesome."
6302800,6303840," Completely stupid."
6303840,6304680," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
6304680,6305520," I'm excited."
6305520,6306360," Okay, all right."
6306360,6308520," Time for Wanchow after dark."
6308520,6309800," Pew."
6309800,6311520," Which is not that dark anymore."
6311520,6313160," 'Cause we had some feedback."
6313160,6314000," Wanch."
6314000,6314840," We listened sometimes."
6314840,6317400," Wanchow after slightly darker."
6317400,6319240," Yeah."
6319240,6320240," It's like barely even noticeable."
6320240,6321640," Yeah, yeah, that's all right."
6321640,6322480," Yeah, that's pretty good."
6322480,6323320," Yeah, that's okay."
6323320,6324160," Good job, Dan."
6324160,6325000," You can tell."
6325000,6326000," Now, that was really dark."
6326000,6327480," When he walked right in front of the camera."
6327480,6329200," I remember when Dan used to--"
6329200,6331160," Remember when Dan used to crawl under the camera"
6331160,6332440," and stuff and give--"
6332440,6333280," Oh, his man."
6333280,6334120," (beep)"
6334120,6336040," I used to have production standards"
6336040,6338520," and they just, we broke him."
6338520,6339440," Throw him away."
6339440,6341000," I don't wanna comb my hair anymore."
6341000,6343440," Okay, merch messages, I guess."
6343440,6344360," All right, cool."
6344360,6346600," Sure."
6346600,6347880," Greetings from Quebec."
6347880,6351440," Since the warranty of my Z-Fold 3 is now over,"
6351440,6352840," I'm afraid to break it."
6352840,6354680," What would you suggest as a user"
6354680,6356520," to keep it as long as possible?"
6356520,6360000," PS when ABC of gaming in French."
6360000,6366480," Okay, so what would you suggest"
6366480,6368080," to keep as long as possible?"
6368080,6370960," I mean, be careful with it."
6370960,6375440," As for ABCs of gaming in French,"
6375440,6378360," my French, not good enough."
6378360,6383320," I mean, maybe we could try and hire a translator."
6383320,6387040," That would be a very difficult thing"
6387040,6389400," to translate and maintain the meter."
6389400,6390680," Oh, yeah, 'cause it like--"
6390680,6391520," It rhymes."
6391520,6392360," Rhymes and stuff."
6392360,6393200," Yeah."
6393200,6394400," Yeah, that's actually pretty rough."
6394400,6399360," And like, there are songs that have been successfully"
6399360,6403120," translated from English to French and vice versa."
6403120,6405440," I think that book would be really challenging,"
6405440,6407560," having written the English one."
6407560,6408400," Especially--"
6408400,6409480," Especially a whole other book."
6409480,6412080," Well, it also just contains like technical terminology"
6412080,6415880," for which the literal direct translation is just that word."
6415880,6416720," But like--"
6416720,6418240," Oh, French accent."
6418240,6419880," Like with a French accent."
6419880,6421680," So I, sorry."
6421680,6424400," Well, AJ, one of our legitimately,"
6424400,6429960," actually like, Francophone team members, the--"
6429960,6431760," Legitimately, do we have anyone else?"
6431760,6432600," Oh, I think--"
6432600,6433440," There's--"
6433440,6435800," There's other--"
6435800,6436640," A prime--"
6436640,6438280," Other Alex."
6438280,6439120," I think that's it."
6439120,6439480," Yeah."
6439480,6440680," I think it's A prime and demo."
6440680,6441480," Yeah, OK."
6441480,6443640," All right, never mind."
6443640,6447040," Anyway, no."
6447040,6448320," Sorry."
6448320,6450320," Antelope?"
6450320,6451520," Oh, yeah, yeah."
6451520,6452520," He must speak French."
6452520,6455520," So four, I think?"
6455520,6456120," I don't know."
6456120,6458680," Oh, David speaks French."
6458680,6459960," I must hear Gautier."
6459960,6460640," Oh."
6460640,6461160," Yeah."
6461160,6462760," Yeah, so you'd think I would, but no."
6462760,6465240," Laffre Nie."
6465240,6466440," Not even a little."
6466440,6468120," He doesn't even know what I just said."
6468120,6470040," [LAUGHTER]"
6470040,6470800," No, I do."
6470800,6471880," I do."
6471880,6473800," I speak French and then my last name."
6473800,6475200," It's--"
6475200,6475880," OK."
6475880,6477480," I know that much."
6477480,6479600," That's actually like brushing on the limit."
6479600,6483520," [LAUGHTER]"
6483520,6485960," I know Sotomous."
6485960,6487720," OK."
6487720,6489480," Because it's on packages."
6489480,6491120," OK, that's why."
6491120,6492160," There's no other reason."
6492160,6493400," Wait, like cream soda."
6493400,6494240," Cream soda."
6494240,6496160," I thought it was funny when I was a kid."
6496160,6498120," How often do you even fucking drink cream soda?"
6498120,6500000," I do not remember the last time."
6500000,6501600," But when I was a kid, I thought it was funny."
6501600,6502920," So I remembered it."
6502920,6504040," OK."
6504040,6505360," That's what you retain."
6505360,6506360," Yeah."
6506360,6506800," OK."
6506800,6509560," [LAUGHTER]"
6509560,6511720," We need to burn through some of these."
6511720,6513440," We have like no time."
6513440,6514960," Yeah, Luke."
6514960,6516320," Cream soda."
6516320,6517280," Hello."
6517280,6518320," Hello, Linus and Luke."
6518320,6519800," Greetings from Germany."
6519800,6522080," I always wondered if you guys got in trouble"
6522080,6525160," or if sponsors frowned upon you guys using memes"
6525160,6526760," in your sponsored videos."
6526760,6530360," It means like 69 or 420."
6530360,6534240," Every once in a while, we had a video that was sponsored"
6534240,6536880," by someone."
6536880,6537880," I don't remember."
6537880,6538680," Was it HP?"
6538680,6539680," I don't know."
6539680,6543760," Anyway, the product was their Z workstation 420."
6543760,6548120," And we managed to slip a lot of pot jokes into it."
6548120,6551520," But there was one particular shot where we actually"
6551520,6555880," put a thing in the front grill of it"
6555880,6557560," and had it smoking."
6557560,6560120," Like they had the computer smoking weed."
6560120,6562600," And that did not make it past the sensors."
6562600,6563600," Wow."
6563600,6564080," Oh yeah."
6564080,6564600," I remember that."
6564600,6566040," I was surprised."
6566040,6567600," Geez."
6567600,6572120," In general though, I think sponsors know what this is."
6572120,6574760," Like if you don't do your due diligence watching a couple"
6574760,6577240," videos from a channel before you throw money at them,"
6577240,6579080," that's on you."
6579080,6582960," I don't feel bad."
6582960,6584920," Any new house videos coming soon, I"
6584920,6587640," think it's the most engaging content on the channel."
6587640,6588280," I don't know."
6588280,6590240," Maybe if my pool ever gets finished,"
6590240,6593000," speaking of which, there's been a new development there."
6593000,6594920," We've issued an ultimatum."
6594920,6599040," They told us it was going to be two weeks to completion,"
6599040,6599680," three weeks ago."
6599680,6603240," We've had to reschedule our electrician four times"
6603240,6606920," because they keep just not showing up."
6606920,6609680," And so we basically said, look, this is ridiculous."
6609680,6613000," You'll be here on Monday and you will be working continuously"
6613000,6616560," until the project is done or we're going public."
6616560,6617760," It's something I hate doing."
6617760,6619200," I actually hate doing it."
6619200,6622480," But this has actually been insane to the point of like,"
6622480,6624000," should be criminal."
6624000,6624840," No, it is."
6624840,6625440," Oh, OK."
6625440,6628280," In my opinion."
6628280,6629200," I don't need any--"
6629200,6631680," Liebble or whatever."
6631680,6637360," But they have, in my opinion, from my experience almost"
6637360,6639920," certainly broken multiple laws in the way"
6639920,6641240," that they've engaged with us."
6641240,6647760," And they deserve, I think, to never be in business again"
6647760,6648320," at this point."
6648320,6651040," From what I've heard, I completely agree."
6651040,6656040," So if nothing happens on Monday, I will--"
6656040,6659600," I'll see you guys next Friday and I'll let you know how it's"
6659600,6661000," going."
6661000,6663160," There's another contractor that might be"
6663160,6664640," willing to pick up the job."
6664640,6668520," But from looking at another review of these guys,"
6668520,6670560," even apparently it took six months"
6670560,6672680," and was pulling teeth to get a small job done."
6672680,6675880," So I don't know."
6675880,6678000," I guess we'll see how it goes."
6678000,6678520," Yeah."
6678520,6680920," Yeah."
6680920,6685000," Hey, DLL, picking up some merch for Linus Voice, my wife."
6685000,6685920," That's not Linus Voice."
6685920,6687120," That's Borat Voice."
6687120,6688360," But anyway, yes."
6688360,6689480," You're going to do it?"
6689480,6690000," No."
6690000,6690960," OK."
6690960,6694320," With the growing size of LTT and improving Markbench,"
6694320,6695880," what steps you're taking to ensure"
6695880,6698160," GPU reviews are free of errors?"
6698160,6699800," So a couple of things we've added."
6699800,6704920," So OK, so one is, as we improve our machine vision"
6704920,6709480," capabilities, we are expecting to be able to monitor not just"
6709480,6712600," for anomalies in our results, but also anomalies"
6712600,6716080," in the visuals of the game."
6716080,6719280," That's something that one of our team members actually"
6719280,6722680," has some experience with from testing mobile games"
6722680,6724400," at his previous job."
6724400,6726840," And in the long term, we would like"
6726840,6730560," to be able to evaluate the visual fidelity of features"
6730560,6734960," like DLSS or FSR as part of the way"
6734960,6738800," that we present performance data for these GPUs."
6738800,6740360," That's going to take a long time."
6740360,6743560," For now, at the very least, we've implemented a checking"
6743560,6746720," stage where the labs goes through the data"
6746720,6748600," and goes through the finished videos"
6748600,6750640," to make sure that the writing team didn't miss anything,"
6750640,6752520," not because the writing team is dumb or incompetent,"
6752520,6754960," but because it's often just crunch for these videos"
6754960,6756920," and things can get missed."
6756920,6759960," It's improved things a lot, but there's still room for us"
6759960,6761000," to continue to improve."
6761000,6765040," Hey, LLD."
6765040,6767960," Do you guys think any labs content will be at LTX?"
6767960,6769960," Personally, I'd love to see some of the stuff"
6769960,6772200," y'all are working on demoed."
6772200,6773760," For example, keyboard testing."
6773760,6775000," That's a really good question."
6775000,6776520," And right now, the answer is no."
6776520,6779120," I don't think we have anything planned for LTX."
6779120,6782720," I mean, most of the labs equipment is pretty planted."
6782720,6784480," Yeah, kind of bolted to the ground."
6784480,6788200," Oh, yeah, I don't really know what to tell you."
6788200,6789240," It could be interesting."
6789240,6790240," I know like,"
6790240,6795480," PAX had some multi-site stuff some years."
6795480,6798360," It could be interesting one year to have like,"
6798360,6799840," oh, this would be really hard."
6799840,6800920," I don't think we could do it actually."
6800920,6805320," Well, we're offering tours of the lab as part of LTX."
6805320,6806160," Yeah."
6806160,6807000," So there's that."
6807000,6810600," Think of like, if you had like another event,"
6810600,6813880," which was like, you could go through some testing at the lab."
6813880,6817040," We're not close to there and that would be very hard."
6817040,6817880," No, we're not."
6817880,6818720," It might not be feasible."
6818720,6820120," Yeah, no guarantees on that one."
6820120,6823200," It'd be neat, but it's probably never gonna happen."
6823200,6824360," Hey, LLD."
6824360,6826440," I often watch videos over discord,"
6826440,6828040," screen share with friends."
6828040,6830680," Some sites block screen sharing in this way."
6830680,6832360," What is your opinion of this practice,"
6832360,6836640," both as a consumer and as float plane executives?"
6836640,6839120," I totally get why people do it."
6839120,6840000," Absolutely."
6840000,6844120," And also there is absolutely ways around it."
6844120,6847800," How would you even block that?"
6847800,6850880," I mean, there's ways to."
6850880,6853480," Oh, right, block screen capture."
6853480,6854320," Yeah, okay."
6854320,6856520," Well, anyway, I mean, I can tell you."
6856520,6858120," If something shows up on your screen,"
6858120,6859880," there is a way to capture it."
6859880,6864240," Yeah, I mean, this is a tough one, right?"
6864240,6866720," 'Cause as a consumer, I think it's super cool."
6866720,6868920," It's one of the features that I actually pitched"
6868920,6870400," as something that would be really neat"
6870400,6873500," for float plane to have like native support for."
6873500,6878320," But I can tell you now that the creator"
6878320,6881720," of whatever that is is not being compensated in any way"
6881720,6883520," for whatever that is."
6883520,6886880," So take that for what it is, right?"
6886880,6889640," If you're enjoying this content,"
6889640,6894640," then the idea there is that you should maybe think"
6894640,6899440," that the person who created it should be compensated"
6899440,6902520," in some way or not."
6902520,6904760," And that's kind of your call, right?"
6904760,6906000," But that's what's happening."
6906000,6907720," And that's why they block it."
6907720,6909160," I don't think we're putting any effort"
6909160,6910980," into blocking it at this point in time,"
6910980,6915280," but we're also not a small creative team"
6915280,6918800," and we're not sort of live or die depending on whether"
6918800,6920840," we get that $100 check this month"
6920840,6922080," or whatever else it is, right?"
6922080,6925700," So we're quite diversified."
6925700,6926540," Yeah, it's tough."
6926540,6929400," You just gotta think about what you're doing"
6929400,6932460," and understand the impact and make your call, right?"
6932460,6934660," Yep."
6934660,6937400," Linus, what's with all the fancier, sillier,"
6937400,6939140," wordlier videos lately?"
6940400,6941700," I don't know, it's just fun."
6941700,6942620," It's just pure fun."
6942620,6945180," I like silly words."
6945180,6946980," I like grabbing your attention."
6946980,6947820," Look, it worked."
6947820,6952260," I'm going to be in Taiwan for the next two weeks."
6952260,6953340," Wonder why?"
6953340,6955740," Do you recommend somebody in the tech industry"
6955740,6959260," go to Computex for fun with their significant other?"
6959260,6960780," Or is it too formal?"
6960780,6962420," It's industry only."
6962420,6964580," CES, are wait, no, is it?"
6964580,6965780," CES is."
6965780,6967380," I can never remember."
6967380,6968700," For I'm pretty sure both of them,"
6968700,6970540," there is a way that you can buy a pass,"
6970540,6973260," but it's like really, really brutal."
6973260,6977120," Well, they say that I think they're in the tech industry"
6977120,6978920," already, so we can kind of like--"
6978920,6979760," Oh."
6979760,6980600," They would just go--"
6980600,6981680," You're in the tech industry."
6981680,6982680," They don't have to go."
6982680,6984480," Go to Taiwan right now,"
6984480,6987360," but you're not going to Computex."
6987360,6988200," I'm good."
6988200,6990160," But they would go to Computex for, oh yeah, okay."
6990160,6991000," Yeah."
6991000,6991840," This is very strange."
6991840,6993120," Oh yeah, no, yeah, of course."
6993120,6994880," Yeah, yeah, Computex is fun, it's cool."
6994880,6995720," It is."
6995720,6996560," Yeah, go for it."
6996560,6997400," See you there."
6998400,7002840," Hello, Dan and Dan's assistance to the WAN show."
7002840,7004800," I'm using the L2D screwdriver to perform"
7004800,7006720," jet engine maintenance currently."
7006720,7007560," Sick."
7007560,7009000," Where is the most interesting place"
7009000,7011280," you have found your merch being used?"
7011280,7014160," I mean, there was that time that skating Olympian"
7014160,7016840," had our water bottle just like casually on TV"
7016840,7017680," on the Olympics."
7017680,7018520," Oh, sweetie, yeah."
7018520,7020400," Yeah, that was really cool."
7020400,7023720," I'm trying to think there's gotta be some other cool stuff."
7023720,7027360," Did any of the boys at NASA have any of our merch?"
7027360,7028600," Uh, yeah."
7028600,7030280," Okay, that's cool."
7030280,7031960," I didn't actually see it on site,"
7031960,7034520," but we weren't like where they were doing that type of stuff"
7034520,7036000," anyways, to make sense."
7036000,7040840," That we've seen a lot of people review the screwdriver"
7040840,7043000," that do really cool stuff."
7043000,7044760," We saw the guy that works on drift cars in Japan."
7044760,7045920," Oh yeah."
7045920,7047400," We've seen a bunch of different people"
7047400,7049680," that do a bunch of random stuff"
7049680,7050640," that they need to screwdriver for."
7050640,7052000," It's been very cool."
7052000,7052840," Yeah."
7052840,7053720," It's a good screwdriver, what can I say?"
7053720,7054880," Yeah."
7054880,7056640," There's a bunch in potential Linus"
7056640,7059400," that are pretty specifically directed at you."
7059400,7060000," Oh, yeah."
7060000,7061240," There's a bunch of them directed at you"
7061240,7063600," that I've been able to answer for you, but not all of them."
7063600,7064920," Okay, Torin asks,"
7064920,7067760," \"Would you ever do an LTT Labs official quality certification"
7067760,7070360," for specific products like USB and HDMI?\""
7070360,7072520," It depends."
7072520,7073680," We'd have to find a way to do it"
7073680,7076280," where it doesn't compromise the Labs' vision,"
7076280,7079600," which is to be a check and a balance"
7079600,7082800," on these certification bodies"
7082800,7086200," and these product manufacturing bodies."
7086200,7091080," I think that something like the way that 80+ operates,"
7091080,7095880," theoretically is really good, but in practice has,"
7095880,7103560," I think been less effective over more recent years."
7103560,7105640," And I think that's where cybernetics"
7105640,7107280," has had an opportunity to step in"
7107280,7110200," and provide a more meaningful certification program."
7110200,7111800," So if we were going to do something,"
7111800,7112920," I would just want to make sure"
7112920,7115840," that we're only doing it in an area"
7115840,7118400," where we have the time and attention"
7118400,7121000," to focus on making sure that we are the be-all"
7121000,7123960," and end-all of standards for that particular vertical."
7123960,7126160," And that's a really challenging thing to do."
7126160,7129280," It's going to take a long time."
7129280,7132240," So I can archive that now."
7132240,7135400," Hey, Linus, love the show and all the best with your new role."
7135400,7137320," I was wondering if there were any upcoming videos"
7137320,7138680," for channel Super Fun."
7138680,7140880," Seems like it's on the back burner at the moment."
7140880,7144240," The answer is, you are right."
7144240,7145920," It is on the back burner at the moment,"
7145920,7147680," Dennis has transitioned into a new role."
7147680,7150800," So there is not a formal channel manager"
7150800,7152200," for channel Super Fun right now."
7152200,7155560," Unfortunately, it's just not been sustainable for us"
7155560,7157720," from a financial standpoint."
7157720,7160000," That's business speak for,"
7160000,7162800," we were losing money on it again."
7162800,7165160," I don't know what it is."
7165160,7169160," I always really enjoyed doing channel Super Fun"
7169160,7171200," when it was just kind of hanging out"
7171200,7172800," and doing a weird challenge or whatever,"
7172800,7176480," but there's a lot of things that come"
7176480,7179960," with being a bigger company that are not a lot of fun."
7179960,7184960," Channel Super Fun relied on just kind of spontaneity"
7184960,7190720," and people participating just for the sheer fun of it"
7190720,7193840," and not worrying too much about things like,"
7193840,7196240," okay, prizes are something that are really tough."
7196240,7197240," Like the meta's changed."
7197240,7200520," People expect there to be like a giant prize for--"
7200520,7201520," - We give you a car."
7201520,7203800," - Doing something, but we've done things"
7203800,7206960," kind of like that in the past, even with small prizes."
7206960,7211960," So when we did the Mario Kart AR racing thing on LTT,"
7211960,7216400," we offered people winning a day off or something like that."
7216400,7219080," I think it, I forget exactly what it was."
7219080,7221120," And the amount of backlash internally"
7221120,7224280," over not being selected to participate,"
7224280,7226480," so not getting a chance to win that,"
7226480,7229800," led us to create this whole convoluted program"
7229800,7233560," for Channel Super Fun where the participants"
7233560,7236400," were actually competing for a prize,"
7236400,7239560," but then everyone else internally could bet on the outcome"
7239560,7242560," and share the prize with the participant who won."
7242560,7245080," So that way everyone could participate"
7245080,7248040," and that it's just, basically,"
7248040,7251280," this is why we can't have nice things"
7251280,7254200," because it created a whole bunch of politics"
7254200,7258720," and jockeying for being featured on the channel"
7258720,7261640," and complaining about not getting screen time"
7261640,7263760," or being in a role where you're not on screen"
7263760,7266280," or whatever else, and I just like, I can't,"
7266280,7268240," I just can't anymore."
7268240,7271320," That's why a lot of, I'm not gonna name any specifics,"
7271320,7273880," but that's why a lot of those types of channels,"
7273880,7275920," the prizes, particularly when they're internal"
7275920,7277360," for the staff, it's just all fake."
7277360,7280040," Like, come on, guys, get real, right?"
7280040,7282800," What do you want from me?"
7282800,7285400," Let's keep churning through."
7285400,7287280," - Yeah, Linus, are you officially switching"
7287280,7290320," from the Steam deck to the ROG ally,"
7290320,7293200," planning a two terabyte SSD upgrade in the ally"
7293200,7297080," with Sabrent's new 2.230, two terabyte SSD."
7297080,7298960," I think he's got one there."
7298960,7300860," Indoor, Hody, restock, when?"
7300860,7303680," - Soon, soon."
7303680,7306040," I think we've actually got it nailed down"
7306040,7308320," and we're ready to go to mass production,"
7308320,7310400," but it's gonna take a little bit more time."
7310400,7312320," But yeah, I'm switching over to the ally."
7312320,7315600," I was actually on the I&O next before the ally,"
7315600,7317000," and one of the things I liked about it"
7317000,7319680," was that it had support for M.2 2280 drives,"
7319680,7322040," full length drives, although I think you could cram"
7322040,7325440," one in the ally if you just had a little M.2 extension thing"
7325440,7328040," and I'd like to put a bigger drive in it if I could."
7328040,7331400," - Finally, caught one of these early."
7331400,7333920," Linus is a fellow fan of cross code."
7333920,7337520," What was your opinion on the post game downloadable content?"
7337520,7339640," And have you seen the in-depth videos"
7339640,7341920," of Radical Fish Games' new project?"
7341920,7344440," - I didn't actually play the post game DLC."
7344440,7348560," I felt like the story ended in such a good place"
7348560,7349840," and I was playing for the story,"
7349840,7350720," not for the dungeons."
7350720,7353440," I actually found the dungeons a little tedious towards the end,"
7353440,7356680," especially that twin dungeon where you do one side"
7356680,7359200," and then you come out, there's no story"
7359200,7360800," in character development whatsoever."
7360800,7363680," Then you do the other side and it's like, oh, what a grind."
7363680,7366600," The puzzles were really creative."
7366600,7368680," It's a really, really well done game,"
7368680,7371960," but I just didn't find anything that appealing"
7371960,7373760," about the DLC."
7373760,7375400," As for their new game, I haven't seen anything"
7375400,7377040," but I will absolutely play it."
7377040,7379600," I consider myself a Radical Fish fan."
7379600,7383600," - Hey, Dil, love the show, my fiancee"
7383600,7386160," and I have been playing It Takes Two and having a blast."
7386160,7387600," What is the first game you and Avon"
7387600,7388800," ever played together?"
7388800,7390640," Any other recommendations?"
7390640,7393180," - Ah, I wanna say pocket tanks."
7393180,7395240," Oh, that's adorable."
7395240,7398360," Look at this, I just go on YouTube and look at us"
7398360,7401880," saying goodbye, not in the way that you think though,"
7401880,7404200," but yeah, pocket tanks is super fun,"
7404200,7409200," just ultra casual game, lots of different weapons and stuff."
7409200,7412480," I think it's like five bucks or something like that,"
7412480,7414680," assuming you can even find anywhere to buy it anymore."
7414680,7419840," You can put up walls and there's all these cool little"
7419840,7422560," different weapons and stuff that you can use."
7422560,7425960," We got to the point where it got pretty intense"
7425960,7428400," and we got pretty good at it and stuff."
7428400,7430880," Here, this must have been some kind of area"
7430880,7432440," of a fact weapon or something."
7432440,7439040," This is pretty slow paced gameplay here, guys."
7439040,7440240," Anyway, that doesn't really matter."
7440240,7441600," The point is, yeah, pocket tanks."
7441600,7443640," This is the first game we played together, I think."
7443640,7446680," - Would you have taken the leap to start a Linus Media Group?"
7446680,7451320," If other outlets like LTT, gamers Nexus,"
7451320,7455280," Hardware Unboxed and MKBHD had existed at the time."
7455280,7458560," - I started LTT because my boss told me to."
7458560,7460080," So."
7460080,7462720," - I guess so."
7462720,7465120," - The leap to LMG, not just LTT."
7465120,7465960," - Oh, yeah."
7465960,7468360," - I mean, yeah, 'cause other stuff did exist at the time."
7468360,7469640," There were other channels."
7469640,7471880," They just didn't happen to be those ones."
7471880,7472720," - Yeah."
7472720,7475880," Linus, seems like you have had bad luck"
7475880,7477280," with contractors for your house."
7477280,7479040," Oh, God."
7479040,7480760," Painters, pool people."
7480760,7483920," How can you find good contractors or trade workers?"
7483920,7485480," - It's like interviewing anyone."
7485480,7486800," You're gonna get it right sometimes"
7486800,7488360," and you're gonna get it wrong sometimes"
7488360,7493360," and while theoretically, you have the law on your side"
7493360,7497520," or whatever and you can hold people accountable in practice,"
7497520,7500280," this is like, it's the whole trust me bro thing"
7500280,7501200," all over again."
7501200,7502040," Yeah, that's right."
7502040,7503160," I'm going there."
7503160,7506160," Luke, deep breaths."
7506160,7509160," - At the end of the day. - No, I came with him."
7509160,7514160," - At the end of the day, a warranty or a law or anything"
7514160,7517800," only exists to the extent to which."
7517800,7518640," - It's enforceable."
7518640,7523640," - One party has the willingness to honor the agreement"
7523640,7527520," and the other party has the willingness"
7527520,7531080," and time and capability to force the other"
7531080,7532480," to honor the agreement."
7532480,7536400," - It can be life ruining level expensive"
7536400,7539600," to actually try to get a company to follow through"
7539600,7541800," with what they're legally supposed to do."
7541800,7543480," - And I know you're about to say,"
7543480,7546240," well, clean, sure, you do it."
7546240,7548040," Are you going to?"
7548040,7549440," And full will."
7549440,7552560," And then when you're done and they have that court order"
7552560,7556320," to pay you, okay, then what?"
7556320,7559360," Are you going to pursue them to actually write you the check?"
7559360,7563560," What if they're fraudsters and they've been Ponzi"
7563560,7565840," scheming the whole thing and their check's just gonna"
7565840,7566960," bounce anyway?"
7566960,7568840," How are you gonna follow that up?"
7568840,7574160," It just, yeah."
7575160,7578440," It is what it is."
7578440,7582160," We're, you know, we hope that we're gonna get this resolved"
7582160,7585960," in an amicable way, but I don't know."
7585960,7588280," - Hi, LLD."
7588280,7591600," I have a hybrid smartwatch with an e-ink display"
7591600,7596320," behind a set of dials, which has most smartwatch functionality"
7596320,7598520," and one month of battery life."
7598520,7602120," Linus, would you use such a watch as a pebble successor?"
7603120,7607400," - What was great about the pebble was just the simplicity of it."
7607400,7611840," It just showed me the text, when a message arrived,"
7611840,7614520," and it had hardware buttons."
7614520,7617240," That's something that I still miss."
7617240,7621400," I actually still use a pebble time for media control"
7621400,7622480," on my motorbike."
7622480,7624000," I just have a pebble time just like,"
7624000,7626000," magneted to my handlebars."
7626000,7626840," - 'Cause it's very gloves, yeah."
7626840,7628120," - 'Cause when I got gloves on it,"
7628120,7629640," see like the only thing I can control."
7629640,7631440," I think there are accessories that function"
7631440,7632640," in much the same way."
7632640,7635080," - But like, you get it done, who cares?"
7635080,7637320," - And the app is already on my old phone,"
7637320,7639080," which is what I use to listen to music"
7639080,7642720," when I'm riding my bike, so works perfectly for me."
7642720,7644600," And it looks like the last one I have today."
7644600,7646760," When you start someone as a new host,"
7646760,7649120," how do you evaluate whether they're a good fit"
7649120,7650480," to stay in the role?"
7650480,7652160," Do you give them specific training,"
7652160,7654320," or is it just sync or swim?"
7654320,7657560," - A little bit of column A, little bit of column B."
7657560,7659840," I mean, the audience is gonna give them all the feedback"
7659840,7661480," they could ever hope for, so."
7661480,7664600," Hey, thanks guys."
7664600,7667480," Some of it valid, some of it phenomenally stupid."
7667480,7671520," - LTT screwdriver, Benizi and a bunch lately,"
7671520,7673160," any updates on Metric's Hex,"
7673160,7676640," Metric Hex Bits and the stubby version."
7676640,7679440," - Yeah, Metric Hex, doesn't seem to be here yet."
7679440,7681320," That I'm as up to date on that as you are."
7681320,7682520," You can message support though,"
7682520,7684240," and hopefully they can get you sorted out."
7684240,7687320," And I do have another small little update on the store."
7687320,7690960," - Zack actually announced an LTT color version"
7690960,7693160," of the Jerry Rig Everything razor knife,"
7693160,7696080," so we don't have it in stock yet, apparently."
7696080,7697440," Thanks, Zack."
7697440,7700320," But we're going to have it,"
7700320,7702760," and you guys can check out,"
7702760,7705080," I think it's his most recent video where he announced that,"
7705080,7705920," so that's pretty cool."
7705920,7706760," - Cool."
7706760,7711120," - And I think that's pretty much it for today."
7711120,7712520," Sorry guys, it has to be a short show,"
7712520,7713720," we gotta get to the airport."
7713720,7715760," See you again next week."
7715760,7720760," Oh, same bad time, different bad location."
7720760,7722440," - But same channel."
7722440,7723280," - Same channel."
7723280,7724560," - I'll still be here."
7724560,7725400," - Bye!"
7725400,7728980," (upbeat music)"
7728980,7733480," (upbeat music)"
7733480,7745480," (laughing)"
7746480,7747840," - Thanks, Vessie, Signal Wire,"
7747840,7749640," and Corsair for sponsoring the show."
7749800,7752380," (upbeat music)"
7752380,7754960," (upbeat music)"
7754960,7757540," (upbeat music)"
7757540,7760120," (upbeat music)"
7760120,7762700," (upbeat music)"
7762700,7765280," (upbeat music)"
