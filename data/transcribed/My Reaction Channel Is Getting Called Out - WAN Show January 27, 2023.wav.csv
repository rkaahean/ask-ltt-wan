0,7600," What is up everyone and welcome to the WAN Show."
7600,10400," We've got a lot of great topics to go through today."
10400,17920," I cannot believe how quickly Dark Viper AU, sorry if I'm pronouncing that wrong, Dark"
17920,25120," Viper responded to our plans to make a reaction channel, but he did."
25120,27360," So we'll be talking about that."
27360,28600," Let's react to that."
28600,33280," We're also going to be talking about perfectly good two-year-old MacBooks."
33280,39080," I was with you perfectly good up until, I don't know, okay, so they're for MacBooks."
39080,43680," They're perfectly good and are apparently being scrapped because of activation lock."
43680,47040," Okay, in all seriousness though, yes MacBooks are perfectly good if they're two years old"
47040,50560," and that's a bad thing, but it's also a bit more complicated than that."
50560,52360," What else we got today?"
52360,53360," You know, stuff."
53360,58640," We've seen that issues mass corrections for AI-written articles, this is actually hilarious, I'm excited"
58640,59640," for that."
59640,60640," It's like really funny."
60640,61640," Yeah, it's good."
61640,62960," And what else do we do?"
62960,64720," What else do we do?"
64720,66560," Linus talks about washing his butt."
66560,67560," Really?"
67560,68560," Yeah, why not?"
68560,71800," Seriously, you don't want to do public backlash against Microsoft for reducing gamers' power"
71800,73480," bills, it's pretty funny to you."
73480,75600," I don't even understand."
75600,77000," It's actually hilarious."
77000,78760," Okay, because I don't get it."
78760,81600," Yeah, you won't get it any, no don't read it now."
81600,83800," Let me tell you about it."
83800,84800," Alright."
84800,87440," Oh, we have a fun new segment to introduce this week."
87440,89920," It's going to be called Original Sauce."
89920,98240," I didn't know it would be understandable."
98240,114280," The show is brought to you today by Kudos."
114280,116720," See Sonic and the Ridge."
116720,121640," Alright, let's get this party started."
121640,127400," I am going to get right out ahead of this and say I meant to watch Dark Vipers video,"
127400,128800," and I actually haven't."
128800,131480," I did see that it went up."
131480,135000," I actually read the vast majority of the comments on it because that's how I consume"
135000,136000," YouTube."
136000,137000," That's true."
137000,138000," That this is true."
138000,139000," I don't watch this."
139000,141280," I just read the comments on them."
141280,142520," I've watched this happen."
142520,147440," I didn't really believe it the first time he told me this is actually true."
147440,150760," You can actually get, you can get a deal."
150760,151760," Okay."
151760,152760," Oh man."
152760,154720," We're going off the rails here."
154720,156120," We're going off the rails already."
156120,159360," I would make the argument, and this is going to be a controversial take."
159360,160360," It sure is."
160360,166000," I would make the argument that you can actually get a deeper understanding of a video based"
166000,167000," on reading."
167000,170160," I'm not talking if you read like four comments."
170160,173520," I'm talking a video that has a lot of interaction."
173520,175960," You read several hundred comments on it."
175960,176960," Okay."
176960,183240," I am arguing that you can get a deeper understanding of A, what was discussed and B, the greater"
183240,189120," context of it by reading the comments under a video versus actually watching the video."
189120,190360," People should try this."
190360,193600," With that said, I did make sure someone watched it."
193600,200640," So I had our new wen show writer watch it and summarize it and I will be responding."
200640,207240," So after last week's discussion of a future Linus Media Group reaction channel, GTA Let's"
207240,214320," Player and commentator, Dark Viper responded with a video essay entitled, Is it Even Possible"
214320,216600," for Reaction Content to Be Ethical?"
216600,221920," Because if you guys remember last week, that was one of the sort of guidelines that I laid"
221920,227200," out for what exactly our reaction content could look like."
227200,229760," Dark Viper praised my desire apparently."
229760,236200," I didn't watch the video, but this is evidently true to make ethical reaction content."
236200,243520," But he claims that reaction content fundamentally cannot be ethical and questions the impact"
243520,246240," of a channel as large as LTT embracing it."
246240,248040," We want to get to the end before we comment."
248040,251320," No, I think we can start commenting now because step one."
251320,252400," What's fire on that?"
252400,258280," And I saw a lot of this in the comments as well, which is how I processed the video because"
258280,263200," I'm a reader, not a video watcher."
263200,267320," First of all, they're a lot, man, and it's not just this."
267320,271360," You know, whether it's when people feel like we're not calling out a manufacturer hard"
271360,277640," enough for their pricing or whatever else it is, people seem to really overestimate the"
277640,281120," amount of sway that I have."
281120,286360," I do not have the kind of power that people seem to think I have."
286360,290680," Like, we are a substantial player in the YouTube space."
290680,291680," Don't deny that."
291680,296440," I get my invitation to top creator summit or creator summit or whatever they call it"
296440,297600," now."
297600,302080," And you know, there's some, I look around them like, whoa, okay, I'm rubbing elbows"
302080,306040," with some pretty, pretty big online creators."
306040,307560," Apparently, they think I belong here."
307560,308840," So that's cool, right?"
308840,315400," You know, obviously we're not tiny little minnows in the ocean that is YouTube."
315400,322520," But I do not single-handedly have the power to make or break a style of content."
322520,325560," I think that might be some some reactions."
325560,326560," Some context here."
326560,329640," I think that might be a category thing."
329640,335040," If you are someone who consumes a lot of gaming slash tech stuff, your name's going to be"
335040,337120," all over everything."
337120,340560," So the perception might be an increased amount."
340560,341560," You know what I mean?"
341560,342560," I see."
342560,345240," Everything is dark viper."
345240,346240," Okay."
346240,348640," At least some degree likes the channel."
348640,350160," Okay."
350160,353280," Has worn LTT shirts in videos before."
353280,354280," Sure."
354280,358360," So within his specific bubble might be big as well."
358360,362480," And then another thing is, sure, okay, just as much as the statement that you said might"
362480,369000," be correct, I think at the exact same time in the exact same realm, the idea that you"
369000,376520," underestimate is probably also true because an aspect that I would bring up here is about"
376520,378760," the cannot possibly be ethical thing."
378760,380720," I saw that kind of frowned for a second."
380720,382280," I was like, how can that be?"
382280,385720," That doesn't make because we talked about how you could just you would ask people first,"
385720,386720," right?"
386720,387720," You'd get approval first."
387720,388720," Sure."
388720,389720," Is that fair?"
389720,390960," You're going to talk about the power imbalance."
390960,391960," Yes."
391960,392960," I see."
392960,395960," Because if it's a small channel, well, they might not want to piss you off."
395960,396960," I see."
396960,400640," Okay."
400640,408680," I have been guilty of not considering that aspect of things before."
408680,410600," It's a tough and annoying thing to consider."
410600,411600," Yeah."
411600,412600," I mean, it's tough."
412600,417760," It's really tough because from my point of view, when I was a smaller channel, yes, there"
417760,425920," were times when I definitely bent over backwards to do something for a larger channel."
425920,433920," But there were also times when I just either directly, usually not directly, but would"
433920,438800," just kind of blow off a larger channel and just say, yeah, maybe someday."
438800,441320," And then just kind of passive aggressively never reply."
441320,444240," Like I never really struggled with saying no."
444240,445240," Yeah."
445240,446560," But some people might."
446560,450600," I can see how some people might."
450600,454400," But again, I have to come back to this."
454400,458720," I don't have the kind of power you might think that I do."
458720,467440," Like whatever negative consequences you might feel I could somehow bestow, whatever a negative"
467440,470240," bestow is, inflict upon you."
470240,471240," Yeah."
471240,472520," That's a better word."
472520,476520," Whatever you think I could do to you, I probably can't."
476520,481200," And again, I've been told this before, like, yeah, if you're a small channel, like line"
481200,483640," is dumping on you, could destroy your channel."
483640,487600," The fear might be there though, regardless of the possibility, the fear might still be"
487600,488600," real."
488600,492600," Yeah, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but,"
492600,495760," but I can't do anything about that."
495760,498320," I can't do anything about people's fear."
498320,500160," All I can do is tell you that."
500160,502160," And full, full transparency, I haven't watched it either."
502160,504120," So I don't know if you brought up this argument, but."
504120,505120," Wow."
505120,506120," I don't really believe it."
506120,508640," Most professional, most professional podcasts."
508640,510640," Wait, we're doing what he wanted."
510640,511640," We're not really."
511640,512640," We're not."
512640,513640," Yeah."
513640,518800," We're not only not going to play your content on the show, we're not even going to watch"
518800,519800," it."
519800,526560," We're just, we're just taking from the comments."
526560,527560," Okay."
527560,531560," No, this is a really good point from Joni B over on floatplane chat."
531560,537200," Realistically, if I dunk on a small channel, the backlash on me, I'm going to look like"
537200,539680," a whole."
539680,541040," And it's true."
541040,544240," Like even times when we didn't even do anything."
544240,549520," Like remember when, remember when content ID got enabled for the channel through our"
549520,550880," MCN."
550880,556400," And what happened was there were some smaller channels that were getting screen capture"
556400,562480," of Unigine heaven benchmark identified by content ID and then their videos were getting"
562480,565760," like claimed from monetization by us."
565760,573120," The immediate reaction without anybody even asking us even these content creators, nobody"
573120,576880," took a second to ask, Hey, is this on purpose?"
576880,579440," Or is this a bug?"
579440,580960," It was incredible."
580960,581960," It was incredible."
581960,583560," How quickly I was vilified."
583560,587320," And I was like, I had no idea."
587320,592240," And I will immediately upon becoming aware of this, do absolutely everything in my power"
592240,593760," to make it right."
593760,600120," But like put down the pitchforks, please like there is no way with the number of times that"
600120,607360," I've been burned by even the perception that I would do something anti community, anti other"
607360,610640," creators or whatever it is."
610640,614640," I wouldn't even start to touch it."
614640,617520," And so I just, I mean, I've made mistakes."
617520,622320," I mean, there was that time I made the silly voice for Pokeman's take on something."
622320,623440," I don't even remember what it was."
623440,625080," It doesn't matter anymore."
625080,631920," Like I certainly make mistakes, but I mean, oh, yeah, no, no, no man."
631920,633920," I can't do anything to you."
633920,637520," If you're a smaller creator, you got to remember too, like you're punching up."
637520,643360," Like I'm a jerk if I go toe to toe with you at this point."
643360,650760," So anyway, dark viper, dark viper argues that the proliferative, oh, you know what?"
650760,652240," No, I haven't finished addressing that."
652240,658120," So yeah, the potential for people to just feel like they're being pressured or coerced into"
658120,659920," agreeing, that's valid."
659920,662000," We would have to find some way to address that."
662000,663680," I don't have any immediate ideas."
663680,669360," I mean, one thing is you could just reach out proactively with some kind of offer."
669360,673360," And this would be tough because YouTube doesn't have a mechanism."
673360,675000," I mean, maybe this is something I can pitch."
675000,676040," That's a power I have."
676040,677680," I can pitch ideas to YouTube."
677680,682040," But maybe this is something I can pitch is like, Hey, you guys already."
682040,682800," Suggestion."
682800,684840," Well, no, not even that."
684840,688160," Like I'm talking more along the lines of some kind of like a revenue share."
688160,693640," Like, Hey, you guys already have the ability to tag a collaborating creator."
694200,702080," Well, what if you could just deepen that capability and you could tag a collaborating"
702080,704200," creator for revenue share?"
704200,705680," That'd be really interesting, actually."
705680,709960," It might be difficult because people being in like different jurisdictions, for"
709960,716320," example, that might not even have the same ad suitability for eligibility, right?"
716320,721640," So it might play an ad that is not even eligible for monetization in that in that"
721640,722640," jurisdiction, right?"
722840,726400," It might be annoying and they might not be willing to do it because of that."
726400,730880," But it might be one of the situations where just only certain zones can collaborate"
730880,731720," with other ones."
731720,735120," But that's like that's that sucks, right?"
735120,736560," That's that's why I said they might not make it."
736560,736760," Yeah."
736760,739520," See, that's not that's not a creator centric approach."
739520,742720," I mean, I would say that even if there's some limitations, it would be better for"
742720,750440," us to say, Hey, in in the interest of, you know, a fair play, we really would like"
750560,756520," you to do your best to kind of divvy it up 80, 10, 10, according to, you know, how"
756520,758960," much of the their source content that we used."
758960,763960," I mean, that way, I think there's there's a very strong argument to be made that"
763960,770200," while you should still stay well within the the guidelines or pillars of fair use,"
770200,776840," at least then if you, you know, stray a little bit over the line or at least then"
776840,779600," if you have an agreement with them, you can kind of say, well, everyone got paid."
779920,781280," So cool."
781280,784600," Um, so that that would be that would be one way to take care of it."
784600,788560," And for those of you who are who are going to propose that, you know, maybe we"
788560,792760," just like issue checks or whatever, I can tell you right now, the admin on this"
792760,794520," would absolutely destroy it."
794520,798320," We basically just never react to anything and be like, no, like"
798320,803560," Yvonne's wrist would be too tired to do much more important things if she had"
803560,804640," to sign that many checks."
804640,805120," Yeah."
805120,806680," So you can have it."
806680,810760," Really more important things."
810760,815320," Um, so dark Viper argues that the proliferation of parasitic reaction"
815320,819240," content, uh, such as certain kinds of live streaming has negatively impacted"
819240,825040," creators of original content and has pushed more creators to also make reaction"
825040,825520," content."
825520,831600," I mean, yeah, I was, I feel like I was completely transparent with the community"
831600,832080," last week."
832080,835480," I, I said, look, this is the lowest hanging possible fruit."
835480,838640," Like it, it, it boggles my mind."
838640,842760," It's, it's one of those genres that I don't personally consume."
842760,844840," I don't personally get it."
844840,848360," Um, but I can't ignore the appeal."
848360,851080," People love it."
851080,856440," Like, do you know how hard Jake in particular has been a champion of react"
856440,860360," content here, whether it's, um, actually, I think it was, it would, uh,"
860360,863840," Linus reacts to mean comments was a James initiative more than Jake."
863840,864680," Damn it."
864680,870280," But both of them, you're even dropping fake GPUs."
870280,871960," I mean, this one's safe at least."
871960,872320," Yeah."
872320,874360," But both of them have pushed hard."
874360,876760," Like we'll have a week when we're kind of sitting there going, oh man,"
876760,878880," we're really going to struggle to hit quota this week."
878880,881960," And they're like, dude, do the easy to just react."
881960,885080," We have had an issue for a long time."
885080,885280," Yeah."
885280,888960," This is completely ignoring the react content thing just for a second."
888960,893320," It, it touches on this, but yeah, we have had an issue for a very long time of"
893320,896320," just a rough using to take easy wins."
896320,902720," And if we're like, Hey, that project sounds not difficult and also highly"
902720,908080," profitable, the answer is just like, no, we need to find the more difficult"
908080,912760," project, which has a less like, no, it's not that it's not that I'm obviously"
912760,913280," exaggerating."
913280,914480," There are other reasons."
914480,915800," But there has been some of that."
915800,921520," The reason is that I find it boring and I find it lazy and I don't respect it."
922560,924320," Like that's so then why are you doing a reaction?"
924320,927040," Because we're running a business here."
927040,929600," I have a hundred people to support."
929600,929920," Yeah."
929920,934040," And this is the same reason why we used to argue to take the whole hanging."
934040,936120," It's the exact same argument."
936120,937920," I'm happy you're on our side now."
937920,942960," I was a to be fair, it wasn't always react content or if it was react content."
942960,945560," This is where we get into it."
945560,949680," It wasn't reacting to other people's generated video content."
949960,953000," It was reacting to user comments or whatever else."
953000,955720," But yeah."
955720,959720," I mean, it's one of the like."
959720,967480," Sticking with what I like has been a winning strategy for this channel for like"
967480,972720," 14 years when I get bored of something and I get bored of things like real quick"
972720,973320," styles."
973320,975400," Other people are likely getting bored of it as well."
975400,978080," They might not even realize they're getting bored of it yet."
978440,982040," And if I move on, it's like it's classic showbiz."
982040,984080," Always lead them wanting more."
984080,984440," Yeah."
984440,990000," If I move on before you guys get a chance to go, oh, I really wish they'd like move on from"
990000,993080," you don't want to make that next season of the TV show."
993080,996720," If the next season of TV show is going to be crap and everyone's going to remember"
996720,998640," that show as ending really poorly."
998640,1000080," Yeah, it's classic Game of Thrones."
1000080,1000440," Yeah."
1000440,1002080," Game of Thrones right there, right?"
1002080,1005920," As much as it sucks, you would rather firefly than Game of Thrones."
1005960,1008560," And too soon."
1008560,1016000," And the thing is that, yeah, and the thing is that like, it's not wrong of me to trust"
1016000,1020160," that and say, look, I feel like this is, I feel like this is cheap."
1020160,1022320," I feel like it cheapens the brand."
1022320,1024200," I feel like it looks low effort."
1024200,1024920," I feel like it doesn't."
1024920,1025800," I feel like it does that."
1025800,1027160," Um, you know what?"
1027160,1029040," I've ended up being wrong in some of those cases."
1029040,1033800," No, the consumer was not savvy enough to recognize that this is low effort garbage"
1033800,1035760," and they want more low effort garbage."
1035760,1036440," Okay, fine."
1036440,1037080," I'll give it to them."
1037080,1037640," Or they want to."
1037640,1040240," I mean, we figured that out with, uh, with video quality, right?"
1040240,1045080," But what, what's critical, what's absolutely critical and what I will never"
1045080,1051880," back down from is that for every upload that you do that is like low effort, like, okay,"
1051880,1057080," for example, um, we uploaded a tier list for the first time or not uploaded."
1057080,1062560," We recorded a tier list video for the first time ever, um, right in the lead up to the"
1062560,1063320," Wancho today."
1063320,1064080," Okay."
1064080,1064480," Yeah."
1064480,1065320," I never know what it is."
1065320,1068400," So we did, we did GPU tiers over 20 years."
1068400,1069320," Okay."
1069320,1069720," Yeah."
1069720,1076960," Um, for every one of those you upload, you have to upload something original and thoughtful"
1076960,1081200," and compelling or, or multiple things that are original, thoughtful and."
1081200,1082560," Oh, is that full playing exclusive right now?"
1082560,1084160," No, no, it's going to go up on YouTube."
1084160,1085120," Oh, it's just not a piece."
1085120,1087680," Yeah, it's recorded, but it's not actually understood."
1087680,1087960," Yeah."
1087960,1091120," Um, so it's just like ranking GPU generations."
1091600,1095600," Um, so first of all, we put way more effort into it than some people would."
1095600,1098560," Like it's not just live reactions to it."
1098560,1100280," Like reasons why stuff like that."
1100280,1100480," Yeah."
1100480,1104400," We had someone working on researching it for like a few days and then I sat down and I"
1104400,1108560," did a marathon, like two and a half hour script review where we fact checked things."
1108560,1111880," And I added some of my own things that I remembered and, and all that kind of stuff."
1111880,1113040," Like it's a really good video."
1113040,1114640," Um, okay."
1114640,1118720," So that's not a good example, but if we were going to, if we were going to do some kind"
1118720,1123960," of low effort, low hanging fruit content, there has to be a reason that people"
1123960,1131280," care about your two cents on reacting to this or, you know, unboxing that or"
1131280,1132440," whatever the case may be."
1132440,1135600," And so that's something that I will absolutely not be backing down on."
1135600,1139760," And if anything, we are quadrupling down on because that's a big part of what"
1139760,1140800," the lab is going to do."
1140800,1148080," So when Jake and I do a silly vlog, like, you know, swapping out a couch or something,"
1148240,1149960," you know, in a theater room, right?"
1149960,1154880," When we also are like, Hey, and we're going to change out the projector screen and"
1154880,1158600," the projector because the lab tested it."
1158600,1163360," And these are like the best bang for the buck or the like, just like S tier"
1163360,1168000," wrist projector and screen or whatever else you're going to be able to trust that"
1168000,1173320," our low effort content and our, and our low hanging fruit opinions are going to be"
1173320,1176360," backed by, by data, by, by due diligence."
1176360,1178120," That's what we're trying to build ourselves toward."
1178360,1186560," So we just have to be careful not to see that those view numbers and kind of go,"
1186560,1190360," well, this gravy train will go forever because I've seen, and I'm not going to"
1190360,1190920," name any names."
1190920,1191640," I don't feel like it."
1191640,1192440," It's just not worth it."
1192440,1199280," But I've seen large, very reaction focused channels that used to do a lot of"
1199280,1206040," challenges or a lot of like comedy stuff and then just saw how well reactions"
1206040,1209160," performed and then went to straight reactions."
1209160,1212120," I've seen them just nose dive."
1212120,1214200," I've also seen them do the opposite."
1214200,1215280," Yes."
1215280,1215880," Yes."
1215880,1216760," This is true."
1216760,1220320," But I don't think anyone would watch beast reacts without the main Mr."
1220320,1220800," Beast channel."
1220800,1222960," I just don't think they would."
1222960,1227440," Why should I care what this guy with like a weird mustache?"
1227440,1227800," Thanks."
1227800,1228720," Never watched any of it."
1228720,1229360," So I have no idea."
1229360,1232960," Well, it's just him, but reacting and they gamify a little bit."
1232960,1235720," They always find ways to innovate those guys."
1235720,1239240," But why would I watch this if I didn't know who Mr."
1239240,1239880," Beast was?"
1239880,1243720," Well, there's there's channels that are entirely based around just reacting and"
1243720,1245560," they basically have only ever been that way."
1245560,1248920," So like, yes, but it can work for some people."
1248920,1251200," We're going to get back into the argument we had last week about what"
1251200,1254480," reaction is like I would argue that something like Good Mythical Morning is"
1254480,1255840," heavily reaction based."
1255840,1258960," In fact, you've probably heard me make the argument."
1258960,1261240," Actually, I don't know if you've ever heard me say this."
1261240,1263040," This is something I say to the new writers a lot."
1263040,1266880," Basically, 80 to 90% of YouTube is reaction videos."
1266880,1269120," I haven't heard these."
1269120,1271040," I define it extremely broadly."
1271040,1277680," And the reason for that is that it puts them in the right frame of mind to"
1277680,1283680," write a video for a YouTube viewer because a YouTube viewer is not the same as a TV"
1283680,1284080," viewer."
1284080,1285480," OK, I think I see where you're going."
1285480,1285960," OK."
1286040,1291840," And so the reason that I would define YouTube viewers and the way that I the"
1291840,1295600," reason that I or the reason that I would categorize YouTube viewers differently"
1295600,1300920," and the reason that I would say that most YouTube videos are reactions is right"
1300920,1302480," in the name of the site, right?"
1302480,1303640," YouTube."
1303640,1305200," That was the whole point."
1305200,1307160," The whole point was real people."
1307160,1311440," So no matter what it is, maybe it's a review."
1312360,1317360," My review of a new GPU is fundamentally a reaction video."
1317360,1319360," I am reacting to it."
1319360,1322400," You only care because you care what I think."
1322400,1324480," That's the whole point."
1324480,1331520," And only super produced, super sterile, like corporate run channels are not reactions."
1331520,1338560," So whether it's unboxing Kinder surprises or whether it's, you know, playing with"
1338560,1344720," some toy or like whatever, whatever it is, whether it's like, you know, man,"
1344720,1351440," I'd say like maybe maybe tutorials would be a category that that does not"
1351440,1357080," qualify as a reaction video, but I would I would also say that many tutorial"
1357080,1361200," videos are going to inherently include they people want that personality."
1361200,1365840," And if you aren't reacting, you're basically you're a stiff out there."
1366800,1369520," I think this is a one word, two definition scenario, though."
1369520,1370360," Sure."
1370360,1376760," Because you're using the word correctly, but you're not using the word correctly"
1376760,1379280," in the way that modern content creators are using the word."
1379280,1383200," That's, and I think they're both using it just like in different ways."
1383200,1384080," Sure."
1384080,1386920," But yeah, that makes sense."
1386920,1388360," That's an interesting way to frame it."
1388360,1388800," Yeah."
1388800,1393680," So I mean, yeah, Dark Vipers point that the proliferation of react content has"
1393680,1395240," pushed more creators to also make it."
1395240,1395440," Yeah."
1395440,1395720," Sure."
1395720,1396640," 100%."
1396640,1397240," Sure."
1397240,1398080," No doubt."
1398080,1402200," Dark Viper calls for Linus and other creators considering reaction channels to"
1402200,1405880," not only find a way to limit harm, but also to but to always create something"
1405880,1406400," new and transform it."
1406400,1406720," Oh, yeah."
1406720,1406960," Okay."
1406960,1407240," Yes."
1407240,1415240," So way ahead of you, definitely, because I I feel like at some point, if all you do"
1415240,1421680," is just create derivative works, it hurts the brand, right?"
1421680,1423200," You won't be seen as an innovator."
1423200,1428360," Like, I think I think that one of the reasons that people seem to feel like I"
1428360,1432840," have this outsized impact on the platform or on other creators is because we have"
1432840,1437400," gone out of our way to do things our own way for better or for worse."
1437400,1441400," We've reinvented a lot of wheels, which sometimes people have copied and whatnot."
1441400,1444520," Yeah, which some and which sometimes have crashed and burned and thankfully, nobody"
1444520,1444920," copied."
1444920,1445280," Yeah."
1445280,1445640," Right."
1445640,1452760," Uh, but I feel like we do have a reputation for doing our own thing, which is"
1453120,1453760," which is good."
1453760,1457160," And no, this is not, uh, this is not going to harm that."
1457160,1459160," Um, nerds up in Canada."
1459160,1460040," Yeah."
1460040,1463600," Dark Viper further argues that LMG did not make this decision to highlight small"
1463600,1464000," creators."
1464000,1465920," It's a business decision, potentially very profitable."
1465920,1467480," And I mean, I was transparent about that as well."
1467480,1470840," So I don't really know what the point of bringing that up is."
1470840,1471400," Yes."
1471400,1473080," I mean, it was a business decision."
1473080,1476400," Again, you didn't watch the video neither did I, you might not say it that way."
1476400,1477280," Right."
1477280,1477760," Okay."
1477760,1478360," Fair enough."
1478360,1481120," But like, yes."
1481120,1482160," Um, yes."
1482240,1482560," Correct."
1482560,1482960," Yep."
1482960,1489080," Um, however, however, in order to make ethical reaction videos, we did talk about"
1489080,1491520," the necessity of highlighting smaller creators."
1491520,1495680," And there have been video concepts that have been pitched internally that have"
1495680,1497480," existed solely for that reason."
1497480,1503000," Uh, one that we've started a couple of times and then just we've gotten busy or"
1503000,1505520," like the writers gotten bogged down or assigned to something else or whatever"
1505520,1505760," else."
1505760,1509320," So it's not on purpose that we never completed it, but one was like a, like a"
1509320,1510920," small creator showcase one."
1511240,1517360," I think James got as far as, um, like getting like 20 on a list and then he"
1517360,1520800," wanted to pair it down to like six or something like that and then wanted to"
1520800,1523480," like really watch a lot of the content so we could highlight some of the"
1523480,1524560," like really great things they did."
1524560,1528000," And so I think it was one of those ones where he just got a little too ambitious"
1528000,1531920," and it didn't make it across the finish line, but, um, I mean, it is something"
1531920,1534600," that we do consider even if no, you're right."
1534600,1537880," It wasn't the primary motivation for creating a REACS channel."
1537880,1540880," Um, JP note."
1541520,1542120," Oh, okay."
1542120,1546040," This is the, uh, the writer part of the problem is that the term reaction"
1546040,1550320," content has an extremely broad usage and can include everything from highly"
1550320,1554360," creative content, like Good Mythical Morning to zero effort reposts where"
1554360,1556800," some jerk with a green screen stairs into space in the corner."
1556800,1557040," Yeah."
1557040,1558800," Yeah."
1558800,1559320," Fair enough."
1559320,1562920," Jaden in full plane chat said, I think you need to be more clear what you're"
1562920,1563400," doing."
1563400,1568080," Dark vipers point is that with live streamer reaction reactors, it's nearly"
1568080,1571520," impossible to have fair use since they haven't already seen the content and"
1571520,1576080," can't guarantee there will be substantial content added or that, uh, only"
1576080,1577240," what's needed is included."
1577240,1579960," Uh, as far as my understanding, it's not a live streaming thing though, right?"
1579960,1580400," No."
1580400,1580880," Yeah."
1580880,1581600," So I don't."
1581600,1582200," Yeah."
1582200,1584000," No, no, I mean, I think it's a fair point though."
1584000,1588880," And so yeah, I should clarify that it would be, it would be edited and the"
1588880,1592760," goal would be to make it a highly entertaining standalone piece of content."
1592760,1597720," Like don't expect us to just start reacting to, I don't know, stuff that's"
1597720,1602840," outside of our realm, but like, uh, you know, reacting to sports fails."
1602840,1610680," Like, like why our goal isn't to just go full variety, just broad spectrum,"
1610680,1613840," just shotgun approach to our content creation."
1613840,1619080," Uh, the idea would be to find content that would be well within our wheelhouse"
1619080,1625680," to, to, to discuss and comment on the whole mineral oil PC thing was like my"
1625680,1626760," thing for a long time."
1626760,1627160," Yeah."
1627280,1632160," Um, and a group that has kind of carried that torch a little bit more has been"
1632160,1633000," toasty bros."
1633000,1633520," Nice."
1633520,1637880," Um, they have, let's see, do they have like a top videos thing?"
1637880,1638760," No, they don't do that."
1638760,1642920," I know they've had, um, yeah, I mean, if you go to their homepage and you go to"
1642920,1647000," custom, you scroll down and see custom builds, first mineral PC running windows"
1647000,1652760," 10 and filling it up 4 million views from eight years ago, AMD FX 95 90 and RX"
1652760,1657920," 468 core mineral PC worlds first mineral PC with windows 11 rise in mineral"
1657920,1658760," PC and filling it up."
1658760,1659120," Nice."
1659120,1660920," They do mineral PC stuff."
1660920,1664600," I think reacting to some of it could be cool."
1664600,1667280," I think it may be boost them, but I would only want to do that."
1667280,1669400," If they also thought that would be cool."
1669400,1669680," Yeah."
1669680,1670760," And then it might boost them."
1670760,1673960," Um, so, yeah, I don't know."
1673960,1678920," Well, I've been waiting for LTT sports reacts."
1678920,1682200," No, no, you haven't."
1682520,1685480," Luke reacts to Conrad's God tier Dota gameplay."
1685480,1688480," I would actually I would do that."
1688480,1690040," No, that won't be necessary."
1690040,1692720," Yeah, that maybe doesn't go on the channel, but I would, uh,"
1692720,1696360," our discussions question here, uh, we've got two."
1696360,1700560," So one is that there's clearly a strong demand for reaction style content."
1700560,1704640," Is there value in providing the best possible version of that content?"
1704640,1706760," So obviously I think so."
1706760,1711000," Otherwise I wouldn't do it, but I mean, you have no horse in this race."
1712360,1715880," Uh, I don't think you should just do whatever there's a strong demand for."
1715880,1717880," And I think you would make that same argument."
1717880,1724680," Um, and best possible version, if that best possible version is still trash,"
1724680,1725800," I don't think it should be made."
1725800,1732560," Um, I think there's a lot of ethical questions, but if those can be overcome."
1732560,1735480," That there is potential for good."
1735480,1737720," I do think that's definitely a thing."
1737960,1743560," I have no idea what toasty bro's opinion of what I said earlier is,"
1743560,1746880," but if they thought that was good, I think that would be a good example."
1746880,1755160," Um, I would somewhat struggle to see you finding enough of those scenarios every"
1755160,1757720," week, but maybe you could."
1757720,1758120," I don't know."
1758120,1760400," Well, I'm not saying it's not going to happen."
1760400,1761880," I just think it might be hard."
1761880,1762560," Yeah."
1762560,1765920," Because I mean, you know, as much as I do, creators are a little rough with"
1765920,1767360," communication from time to time."
1768120,1769280," Uh, myself included."
1769280,1772280," So like you might reach out a bunch and just not hear back or you're going to"
1772280,1775960," hear back in two months, or you're going to hear back immediately, but then not"
1775960,1779160," get the confirmation on the next thing for two weeks or whatever else."
1779160,1780560," So like, yeah, it do be like that."
1780560,1785520," You're putting yourself at a lot of risk of, of communication woes, completely"
1785520,1786840," screwing your production pipeline."
1786840,1792760," Um, and then that putting pressure on the team, whose goals potentially and,"
1792760,1796960," and, and whatnot for quarters or however it works, um, is based around getting"
1796960,1801400," enough videos out in that section and then completely outside of their control,"
1801400,1803920," not necessarily because they could shoot more broad spectrum."
1803920,1804920," They could hit up more people."
1804920,1805080," Yeah."
1805080,1806520," And we can react to our own stuff too."
1806520,1808600," Wow."
1808600,1811880," There's an ethical reaction channel."
1811880,1812520," Yeah."
1812520,1815240," I mean, he reacts to LTT man."
1815240,1816560," You only react to your own things."
1816560,1817040," Oh man."
1817040,1820320," I came across the funniest video."
1820320,1826000," You could do like LMG members react to Linus talking, announcing news on the"
1826000,1827440," Wancho that they've never heard of before."
1827440,1828760," We have probably company."
1828760,1834360," I have probably personally made more tech videos that I completely forget"
1834360,1837040," than most other channels have ever uploaded."
1837040,1837440," Yeah."
1837440,1842320," Like for real though, um, we uploaded a video and this, this is hilarious."
1842320,1846400," I came across this today because, uh, as we were working on the tier list video,"
1846400,1849240," I, I was like, yeah, hold on."
1849240,1852800," What, what, what, what were the circumstances around the launch of the GTX"
1852800,1853200," Titan?"
1853480,1856640," So I was, I was looking at, was Luke in any of those videos?"
1856640,1858320," Cause I wanted to find one that we were both in."
1858320,1858760," Yeah."
1858760,1860440," See, I couldn't remember yet."
1860440,1860920," I don't know."
1860920,1861760," I couldn't remember either."
1861760,1866440," So I went back and I was looking at our GTX Titan videos and we had one"
1866440,1868960," called early GTX Titan benchmarks."
1868960,1871600," You click on the video."
1871600,1878640," It's about a minute long and basically before the NDA, I take the card and I've"
1878640,1879560," got it on the bench."
1879560,1881360," I'm like, yeah, here's our test bench."
1881360,1882280," I remember."
1882280,1884960," I quoted that."
1884960,1888400," I pull the card off."
1888400,1890560," I'm like, okay."
1890560,1894240," So what's really important when you're benchmarking is you get it correctly"
1894240,1895480," positioned on the bench."
1895480,1897880," I pull out a fucking chalk."
1897880,1900240," I draw a line around it."
1900240,1903280," And I'm like, there, we marked the bench."
1903280,1904600," There's your early benchmarks."
1904600,1907560," No, but seriously, we're going to have lots of content coming on this card."
1907560,1908000," See you later."
1908840,1912200," I distinctly remember that being made."
1912200,1917440," But I'm stunned that we actually released that."
1917440,1919240," That wasn't on April 1st or anything, was it?"
1919240,1920360," Oh, no, February 2nd."
1920360,1924200," Wow."
1924200,1924680," Yeah."
1924680,1925120," OK."
1925120,1925400," Yeah."
1925400,1929640," Absolute, absolute it move like I don't."
1929640,1932200," I don't know how that's rough."
1932200,1933880," I thought I could get away with stuff like that."
1933880,1934280," That's rough."
1934280,1935440," People aren't even mad."
1935440,1937760," People are so serious now."
1937760,1940560," I was going to say the space was very different."
1940560,1942240," OK, tell me something."
1942240,1944680," Did they change or did I change?"
1944680,1946600," I think a little bit of both."
1946600,1950600," The content's a lot more serious these days, like the especially like content"
1950600,1950960," quality."
1950960,1952520," Think about the stuff we were releasing back then."
1952520,1957240," I mean, yeah, I was taking a GPU and putting it on a bench and drawing a line"
1957240,1957600," around it."
1957600,1959080," Like that was a video, apparently."
1959080,1959440," Yeah."
1959440,1960640," That's like a game."
1960640,1965840," If you release that now, I think there'd be uproar because the average"
1965840,1967160," quality is so much higher."
1967680,1969920," I don't know."
1969920,1970240," There's."
1970240,1977160," Yeah, because that wasn't that much longer than unboxing motherboards in a parking lot."
1977160,1979560," Yeah, I've only been like three years."
1979560,1981160," Yeah, something like that three, four years later."
1981160,1984320," Yeah, like speaking of that era."
1984320,1987640," Do you remember the video we did in turn search?"
1987640,1990440," When we were the Jenga thing?"
1990440,1991440," No, no, no, no."
1991440,1993800," That was that was actually like hiring for a position."
1993800,1996920," This was before we actually had any money and we were like, I don't know,"
1996920,1998520," are like unpaid interns a thing."
1998520,2000520," We were like, is this when we looked for Ed?"
2000520,2001680," No, no, no, no."
2001680,2003720," This is this Ed was there."
2003720,2006240," So remember, where's my C clamp?"
2006240,2009360," You don't remember this at all."
2009360,2010920," I'm getting some."
2010920,2012840," I'm in the backyard in my boxers."
2012840,2013320," This is in the garage."
2013320,2013840," Hold on."
2013840,2014240," All right."
2014240,2015200," Let's just bring it up."
2015200,2016240," Let's just bring it up."
2016240,2017080," All right."
2017080,2018240," We're reacting to our own content."
2018240,2019880," This I'm totally OK with."
2019880,2023560," I think there are no ethical problems with reacting to our content at all."
2023560,2024120," All right."
2024120,2024520," Here we go."
2024520,2025720," Minuses laptop."
2025720,2026480," Let's go."
2027120,2027640," Let's go."
2027640,2028440," Look at this guy."
2028440,2031120," For some reason, I remember this frame."
2031120,2032360," Yeah."
2032360,2037160," I was going for like a super, super."
2037160,2038560," Can they can they hear this?"
2038560,2042880," No, I don't know."
2042880,2043560," Oh, I'm muted."
2043560,2043920," Hold on."
2043920,2044640," There's your problem."
2044640,2047200," No, they should be able to hear."
2047200,2048800," I'm going to Photoshop the last bit on."
2048800,2049800," Hopefully it's not too much."
2049800,2051400," This is a Adobe after a test."
2051400,2054760," Now, why would you want to work at minus tech tips for one thing?"
2054760,2056320," We can obtain a very positive."
2056680,2058440," Yeah, it zooms out in your ear."
2058440,2061680," I was going for like a super, super."
2061680,2062320," Oh boy."
2062320,2063280," The garage."
2063280,2068720," I'm benching Far Cry, I think, or crisis, maybe."
2068720,2070040," That makes sense."
2070040,2073200," I'm also going to a level of profession."
2073200,2077840," Anywho, fun fact."
2077840,2079600," Do you remember the person?"
2079600,2080200," I remember the video now."
2080200,2081680," No, do you remember the person?"
2081680,2082120," Yes."
2082120,2085560," Who like came in twice to basically like hang out with us."
2085560,2085960," I do."
2085960,2090320," Didn't really do any work, which is fine because yeah, that's unpaid"
2090320,2095080," interns are not legal and we'd never even attempted to do that again."
2095080,2095600," Yeah, we were."
2095600,2097360," Look, we were very desperate."
2097360,2100200," It was a desperate time."
2100200,2103960," That person finished their education."
2103960,2105720," Oh, you had the stream audio playing."
2105720,2107960," Oh, oh, sorry, guys."
2107960,2108520," My bad."
2108520,2109640," You can look it up."
2109640,2114960," Yeah, that that person finished their education and is currently"
2115520,2119720," interviewing for an engineering position for a career warehouse."
2119720,2120680," What?"
2120680,2122200," That's actually super cool."
2122200,2125200," Yeah, I was working from home yesterday because we were shooting at the"
2125200,2129320," at the house for AMD 30 day challenge."
2129320,2130760," And then I was doing something else there as well."
2130760,2131360," I can't remember."
2131360,2137240," I remember he came in with a custom keyboard and he had the dust cover."
2137240,2137600," Yeah."
2137600,2143080," So he was in interviewing the day that I was shooting the AMD GPU challenge."
2143080,2144640," I was like, and so Nick messaged me."
2144640,2147400," He's like, yeah, this guy didn't say anything about it until he came in for"
2147400,2147920," the interview."
2147920,2152080," But like, do you remember someone by the name of like, yeah, like, oh, well,"
2152080,2153280," he's in for an interview right now."
2153280,2155160," Do you want to come say, I'm like, Oh, I wish I was in."
2155160,2156440," I would totally come say I."
2156440,2161040," That's why I can tell how useless he was, but how fine that was because we didn't"
2161040,2161400," pay him."
2161400,2162440," So yeah, yeah."
2162440,2163440," Yeah."
2163440,2164440," Yeah."
2164440,2166560," Amazing."
2166560,2167280," That's funny."
2167280,2168120," Amazing."
2168120,2171320," Um, so that's cool."
2171320,2176760," Um, why don't we move on?"
2176760,2179960," Oh, why don't we do our, let's do our new segment."
2179960,2180800," Yeah."
2180800,2183760," This segment is called original sauce."
2183760,2184320," This is cool."
2184320,2184960," Yeah."
2184960,2185480," I like this."
2185480,2191200," And basically it's just going to be finding something that's a development in"
2191200,2191880," the tech world."
2191880,2196600," Like we have people reach out to us all the time going, uh, here's something that's"
2196600,2199960," happening or here's someone we think you might like to talk to you."
2199960,2201880," Do you want to have this person on the podcast?"
2201880,2202920," Do you want to make a video about this?"
2202920,2203360," And you know what?"
2203360,2209320," The answer is usually no, because they have the personality of, um, untoasted toast."
2209320,2210680," That's just bread."
2210680,2216200," Uh, or it's not really interesting enough for like a full video channel release,"
2216200,2220000," because we can't just upload BS anymore the way that we apparently used to."
2220000,2225520," So original sauce is going to be how we're going to tackle this stuff, where we kind"
2225520,2229880," of go, okay, yeah, we can definitely set aside the time to have an off"
2229880,2235400," the air phone call, figure out if this is worth talking about, and then compile some notes"
2235400,2237320," and let the community know about it."
2237320,2240320," So every once in a blue moon, it's enough that we end up making a dedicated video,"
2240320,2242000," but probably not, but probably not."
2242000,2243920," So we're going to the original sauce."
2243920,2247680," And in this case, what we're going to be talking about is case labs coming back"
2247680,2248520," from the dead."
2248520,2254080," So this was all compiled by the new WAN show writer who interviewed the new owner"
2254080,2257560," of case labs, Emil Richards, did it?"
2258720,2261520," Anywho, the new owner of the case labs IP."
2261520,2267160," So case labs was first founded in 1971 and shut down in 2018, citing high U.S."
2267160,2272840," tariffs on the import of aluminum, a primary component of their builds, which had"
2272840,2276480," gone up in price by like 80% or something like that."
2276480,2279480," So they said their prices were just not going to be realistic."
2279480,2281240," They weren't going to be able to compete."
2281240,2285560," Um, Emil is a longtime PC and gaming enthusiast."
2285560,2290000," She's been building his own PCs for over 20 years and until 2021, he was the owner"
2290000,2294040," and founder of a consulting company that assisted Swedish researchers in collecting data."
2294040,2300800," In 2017, Emil bought a case labs case for one of his builds, a case he loved so much"
2300800,2305200," that when the company collapsed in 2018, he reached out to Jim Keating, the former CEO"
2305200,2309600," to discuss acquiring it, a process that was delayed by legal wrangling and the pandemic."
2309600,2310280," So that's where we're right."
2310440,2317800," So this is according to Emil, his approach to reviving the brand is cautiously optimistic,"
2317800,2319000," heavy on the caution."
2319000,2322920," Based on the finances of the former case labs, he believes that the company was on a"
2322920,2328280," consistent upward trajectory with strong fundamentals, but the basic combination of"
2328280,2332720," high overhead and an excessively niche market meant that it could not survive the macro"
2332720,2334680," economic conditions that it faced in 2018."
2334680,2340080," So his hope is they'll be able to restart case labs as a boutique custom case producer,"
2340080,2344240," but also expand into more general broad appeal products to give them a foundation of revenue"
2344240,2345920," while maintaining quality."
2345920,2347440," The team is currently small."
2347440,2352120," And I would say that this is now me talking."
2352120,2358160," I would say this is going to be a big challenge because case labs's advantage was"
2358160,2364720," expertise when it came to small run metal fabrication."
2365520,2373080," It's unclear to me exactly what expertise Emil and his team are bringing, but it might"
2373080,2380640," not have started with that given Emil's previous employment, but OK."
2380640,2383760," I mean, and because they're not, they're not doing the fabrication."
2383760,2385040," Yeah."
2385040,2387520," So the team is currently small."
2387520,2392120," And this was one thing that I had actually asked the writer to check in about because I"
2392120,2397560," had to have a case labs case that I like very much and was sad to discover that I can no"
2397560,2398920," longer get replacement parts for."
2398920,2404080," And apparently that's their plan to start with is to focus on replacements and parts,"
2404080,2405880," ideally by the end of this financial quarter."
2405880,2407200," That seems aggressive."
2407200,2412000," They're going to start with high demand items and then expand once consistent sales are"
2412000,2414280," established, launched a survey in order to collect more data."
2414280,2417800," So if you're a case labs case owner now might be a good time to get in touch and say,"
2417800,2422040," hey, I could really use more drives leads or something along those lines."
2422520,2426880," They eventually wish to create and design cases and bring fabrication in house."
2426880,2431160," And the current plan is to partner with an existing manufacturer in Sweden."
2431160,2434720," So as to keep overhead low, that's questionable."
2434720,2438720," I don't know that low overhead and Sweden necessarily go together very well."
2438720,2442320," Well, I think in this case, because it's a local, I guess so."
2442320,2446640," But they also want to maintain a close eye on quality testing."
2447960,2453160," I admire the will."
2453160,2455920," You know, I admire the spirit here."
2455920,2459320," I think that, you know, resurrecting a beloved brand like case labs."
2459320,2465560," For those not familiar, they made highly customizable, very enthusiast, friendly enclosures."
2465560,2471000," I think that trying to resurrect a brand like that is really cool."
2471000,2474840," But I do question a little bit."
2474880,2480600," The I do think it's going to be extremely challenging."
2480600,2488760," I mean, there's apparently still enough demand for these, the style of case that"
2488760,2490520," mountain mods still exists."
2490520,2493400," This is this is surprising to me."
2493400,2497120," Super cool folks over here from what I can remember."
2497120,2498680," It's been a long time."
2498680,2499320," And who knows?"
2499320,2503760," Maybe, you know, Ben's not there anymore, but, you know, who knows?"
2503760,2504720," Maybe maybe they are."
2505200,2509360," But these guys make kind of a similar style of cube case."
2509360,2513720," I don't know who was the original in this style, but man, one of my one of my"
2513720,2516720," favorite builds I ever did was in the H2GO."
2516720,2520160," This is it was I think it was MATX."
2520160,2524560," Yeah, yeah, yeah, it can do full at X, but I did an MATX build so that I'd have more"
2524560,2527200," room for like a cool reservoir beside it or something like that."
2527200,2530240," Yeah, these guys, these guys did some cool stuff back in the day."
2530880,2535880," But I just don't know, you know, unless case labs sort of reinvent themselves and"
2535880,2541000," looks at different form factors or different styles of cases, I don't know that they"
2541000,2544360," are going to be able to achieve the kind of volume that would give them the growth"
2544360,2547840," that they might need to jumpstart this budding company."
2547840,2548920," I hope they have a lot of runway."
2548920,2555000," And if they don't, or rather, and if they do diversify, then I do wonder if they're"
2555000,2559440," going to be left with what made them case labs, like if they're going to be left with"
2559440,2560160," an identity."
2560160,2564240," Hopefully it works out."
2564240,2565720," I liked case labs."
2565720,2566600," I thought they were super cool."
2566600,2572800," It's intriguing that they're back, but I don't know if any of the original people"
2572800,2573320," are there at all."
2573320,2574320," No, it doesn't sound like it."
2574320,2574760," Yeah."
2574760,2580600," So in that case, it's a brand name with some IP and not the people."
2580600,2584440," And case labs was a very people driven company because you have to be when you're"
2584440,2586360," small and doing boutique things."
2586360,2588440," So it's a tough situation."
2588680,2589520," Hopefully it goes well."
2589520,2591240," Yeah."
2591240,2594080," Cyborg cats asks, this is over on floatplane chat."
2594080,2597640," I wonder if LMG would or has ever considered designing their own cases or even"
2597640,2599480," pre-builds cases."
2599480,2600040," Yeah, sure."
2600040,2600920," We've talked about it."
2600920,2607040," I remember I basically designed what would turn into a pretty common small form factor"
2607040,2614280," form factor of small or small form factor case layout later with my bud Nate at who"
2614280,2615760," was at Cooler Master at the time."
2615760,2618640," I kind of sat there and looked at one of their designs and I was like, yeah,"
2618640,2621240," but it would be better if it was like this and this and this and then it could be like"
2621240,2623000," almost the size of a PlayStation 4."
2623000,2625480," And then we ended up seeing a bunch of cases that were like that."
2625480,2630480," And then one of the other things I was really passionate about was the idea of building"
2630480,2634120," gaming cases that are designed for rack mount and then."
2634120,2636320," Oh, crap."
2636320,2640440," What's the company that does a really, really good job of those now?"
2640440,2642440," I don't remember, but you worked with them for a bit, didn't you?"
2642440,2644240," They sent over a sliger."
2644240,2645560," Wait, yes."
2645560,2645720," Yeah."
2645720,2646320," Sliger."
2646600,2650080," Sliger exists and they seem to be doing a great job of those style of case."
2650080,2654360," So for me, I would have to find something that nobody else is doing that I feel like"
2654360,2656600," the market needs and it's just never really happened."
2656600,2661240," At least not at the right time with us having the right resources in order to bring"
2661240,2662320," something like that to life."
2662320,2667960," As for pre-builts, I mean, I raised all of my concerns about the pre-built PC business"
2667960,2672160," when we reviewed the star forage system that we did a little while back."
2672160,2674680," I'll never say never, but."
2674680,2677680," It's a tough business."
2677680,2678480," Very tough business."
2678480,2682720," Speaking of cases, let's talk about the challenge updates."
2682720,2684160," Yeah, sure."
2684160,2685320," Should we start with arc?"
2685320,2686120," You really want to."
2686120,2686880," Oh, yeah, sure."
2686880,2688200," I've got some things to say."
2688200,2689720," That's why I really want to talk about it."
2689720,2691240," I've got one thing to say."
2691240,2696960," I would like to apologize to everyone for my unprofessionalism in the arc part three"
2696960,2698120," video, part two and a half."
2698120,2698840," Sticker card out early."
2698840,2699640," Whatever it was."
2699640,2701520," No, no, not that at all."
2701520,2704160," I didn't realize that I do this."
2704320,2708080," But I was apparently mouthing along to the script while you were talking."
2708080,2714480," So we tried a really different format for that video."
2714480,2716120," I had no idea."
2716120,2717320," Yeah, a prime message me."
2717320,2719160," He's like, yo, can you not do that?"
2719160,2720520," I had no idea."
2720520,2722440," It's kind of it's like feeding a baby."
2722440,2729360," These are the words, please say the totally subconscious."
2730360,2736240," But we took a bit of a different approach to that video because what I wanted was"
2736240,2739600," for it to have kind of a conversational format."
2739600,2745440," But I also wanted it to have the structure of a hosted, written, delivered video so"
2745440,2747240," that it would be nice and tight into the point."
2747240,2749560," It's to be genuine and conversational, but not Wancho."
2749560,2750640," Yes."
2750640,2754280," But have a bit of like a Wancho vibe and and people picked it up."
2754280,2759000," But one of the side effects was that, yes, it was nearly fully scripted."
2759160,2763560," We ad-libbed a little bit just to kind of keep the energy up so that it wasn't just"
2763560,2765240," taking turns."
2765240,2767000," Yeah."
2767000,2768520," Reading."
2768520,2770320," That was your line."
2770320,2772120," But anyway, if I'd mouth didn't."
2772120,2773680," Yeah, it was going to say, yeah, yeah, yeah."
2773680,2778080," And I was actually I was really I was really proud of it."
2778080,2782720," Like with notes from Luke, I wrote the vast majority of it for both of our parts,"
2782720,2786600," trying to kind of, you know, get his voice and also make sure that I was"
2786600,2792520," including all of his points, but but keeping the structure of the video as tight as a"
2792520,2793600," fully scripted video."
2793600,2795720," But I screwed up."
2795720,2804800," Reading the script along with you, but I'm supposed to be just, you know, supposedly"
2804800,2809040," listening to new words I've never seen or heard of before that are coming out of"
2809040,2810280," you and paying attention."
2810280,2813160," Anywho, what had you wanted to say about it?"
2813160,2814080," Oh, you are doing it."
2814080,2819880," I don't think I would have noticed if no one mentioned it."
2819880,2822600," And I bet you that's going to be true for a bunch of people."
2822600,2825080," So now like tons of people are going to watch this and just see you."
2825080,2830560," Because it's not like you're not like fully enunciating, but it is moving a little"
2830560,2830880," buried."
2830880,2832120," You want to just show the people."
2832120,2832440," Sure."
2832440,2833960," I might need my new screen."
2833960,2835680," Let's see."
2835680,2837920," You can see it."
2837920,2839800," It's minor, but you can see it."
2839800,2841520," You know, I go full screen once."
2843680,2844400," Cringe."
2844400,2850960," Yeah, I think I got to go back."
2850960,2851440," Wait, wait, wait."
2851440,2854200," There."
2854200,2856160," You can see it."
2856160,2857920," It's minor."
2857920,2860920," It's minor, but he's doing it right after this."
2860920,2862600," If I remember correctly, yeah, right here."
2862600,2863520," Oh, hold on."
2863520,2865280," OK, once I got to go back."
2865280,2865840," Yeah, I go back."
2867600,2868680," This is it."
2868680,2870040," Knit."
2870040,2872120," Knit, knit, knit."
2872120,2875560," It's really, it's really minor."
2875560,2877200," That's funny."
2877200,2882320," The worst, the worst thing ever."
2882320,2883240," A bunch of people in chat."
2883240,2884160," Yeah, I can confirm."
2884160,2885080," Didn't see it initially."
2885080,2886720," Yeah, I think most people wouldn't have noticed."
2886720,2888360," I want this to be very clear."
2888360,2891520," Just because something is scripted doesn't mean it's not our genuine thoughts."
2891520,2894000," I took all the notes that Luke provided me."
2894000,2895480," I took all of my notes."
2895640,2899520," It's just a way to and this is something you've definitely heard me talk about,"
2899520,2903080," even if not the every YouTube video is a reaction video, you know, talk."
2903080,2907280," I give a lot of talks during like script reviews and meetings with the writers,"
2907280,2912880," but you've definitely heard me give the the don't waste the audience's time."
2912880,2917240," Talk like density, density, density, density."
2917240,2918640," We were going to script it."
2918640,2921800," Like it should have been scripted, but we were just trying to as a conclusion"
2921800,2923640," video to something like this."
2923800,2927760," It makes sense for it to be more conversational, but it also needs to be scripted."
2927760,2933200," And so what I thought about was just having like headers and then points that we"
2933200,2937480," wanted to make sure we hit, but that wouldn't have achieved the density that I"
2937480,2940080," wanted to turn into something that's way too long because you don't know when to end it."
2940080,2943160," Well, I do."
2943160,2946800," It had to be scripted."
2946800,2947560," Yeah."
2947560,2949720," I can."
2949720,2950760," There's certain things."
2950760,2953480," There's certain if you're not the reason when she was three and a half hours."
2954440,2958920," If you want proof of this, go you're going to have to dig, but go back and find the"
2958920,2961320," Oculus gets bought out by Facebook when show."
2961320,2968400," I think I think I talked about that for literally like an hour."
2968400,2971440," I mean, you end up being right about basically everything, which was kind of,"
2971440,2974320," which is neat, sad, but well, yeah."
2974320,2980520," I got so much flack to people hated me for it because they were like, no,"
2980520,2982000," they said this wasn't going to have it."
2982000,2983160," I'm like, yeah, sure, whatever."
2983200,2985840," Yeah, common Luke W how things go."
2985840,2989400," I've been calling AI stuff very accurately."
2989400,2990560," I know, right?"
2990560,2991760," Like very accurate."
2991760,2995440," Yeah, like even when I'm like, I don't know, I'm probably wrong, but I'm pretty sure"
2995440,2996560," it's going to go exactly this way."
2996560,3003120," And then it totally does open AI announcing the G T chat premium was like, whoa,"
3003120,3005600," like the day after he's like, yeah, it'll be like that."
3005600,3007440," Or I really hope it's like that on land show."
3007440,3009400," All right."
3009400,3009680," Yeah."
3009680,3010840," You got it."
3010840,3011120," Okay."
3011120,3013840," So is there anything else to say about the arc?"
3013840,3014360," Nope."
3014360,3014880," Nope."
3014880,3016360," I don't really have anything else to say either."
3016360,3016560," Yeah."
3016560,3021240," No, I mean, it I kind of I mean, that's the point of scripting it is that I was able"
3021240,3027240," to sit there for four hours, take everything and put it into a nice little package."
3027240,3032280," The most interesting thing to me was that we both had the reaction that after week,"
3032280,3037080," like two or three, we just sort of forgot about it."
3040440,3042520," But yeah, that was that was very interesting to me."
3042520,3043920," But yeah."
3043920,3044280," Okay."
3044280,3044800," New one."
3044800,3047480," AMD challenge, Radeon challenge."
3047480,3049360," You use what?"
3049360,3059400," My computer was fully bricked after swapping, but not because of AMD, maybe."
3059400,3064520," I believe that my BIOS was corrupted."
3064520,3070040," Oh, and it took a total of between Jake and me, probably about three and a half hours"
3070040,3072680," of troubleshooting to get my system back to a bootable state."
3072680,3077480," And there were some compromises."
3077480,3081160," Oh, wow."
3081160,3084280," Were you were you planning to top that?"
3084280,3087560," Maybe."
3087560,3088200," Oh, no."
3088200,3089800," Okay."
3089800,3092680," So there's going to be some spoilers here, guys."
3092680,3095960," If you don't like spoilers, but realistically, you're watching when I show you love spoilers."
3095960,3099800," We do have the AMD Radeon challenge coming."
3099800,3100200," Yeah."
3100200,3110120," We, I, Luke, and we added Jake this time, all upgraded to the Radeon 7900 XTX,"
3110120,3113000," which actually I think for all of us is a substantial performance upgrade."
3113000,3114040," Pretty massive upgrade."
3114040,3117880," I mean, I went from a 3090, which is a pretty darn good card, but I'll tell you,"
3117880,3120360," playing Halo Infinite, 109000 XT."
3120360,3120920," Mm."
3120920,3121160," Yeah."
3121160,3122120," It's fast."
3122120,3122920," I think I'll feel it."
3122920,3123560," She's fast."
3123560,3127400," Quite a bit because I went from Titan RTX, which is still cooking."
3127400,3128040," It's a good card."
3128040,3129080," Totally solid."
3129080,3134120," But, you know, I'm not maxing the capability of my monitor in every game that I'm playing."
3134120,3134680," No, you're not."
3134680,3134680," Yeah."
3134680,3135160," Yeah."
3135160,3135160," Yeah."
3135160,3135320," Yeah."
3135320,3142920," So, first thing you open the box and just whoa, this thing is enormous."
3142920,3149320," I've never had a card that I was putting in my own system that came with a stand."
3149320,3152680," He didn't get a reference card, by the way."
3152680,3153800," Oh, you got a reference card?"
3153800,3156920," Well, someone ended up with a reference card."
3156920,3158360," Oh, okay."
3158360,3158920," Sounds good."
3158920,3161960," Um, it didn't fit."
3161960,3165480," It's not in my system."
3165480,3166360," Oh."
3166360,3168760," It doesn't fit."
3168760,3169080," Cool."
3169080,3176040," So, someone had the infinite wisdom to, like, force me to upgrade to water cooling,"
3176040,3180120," because he knows that I don't like it."
3180120,3183160," So, he gave me a water cooling required motherboard."
3183160,3183640," Oh, yeah."
3183640,3184440," I remember that was cool."
3184440,3185240," That's a good motherboard."
3185240,3185880," It is?"
3185880,3186120," Yeah."
3186120,3188760," That's rock X570 Aqua."
3188760,3192520," I came up with a joke before the show and I wasn't sure if I was going to say it or not,"
3192520,3194200," but I think I'm going to say it."
3194200,3197880," My joke was it's like giving Greta Thunberg a begotti."
3197880,3208120," I guess it's really nice, but I don't want it."
3208120,3208360," Anyway."
3208360,3213560," Okay."
3213560,3213880," Sorry."
3215640,3217480," So, yeah, it didn't fit."
3217480,3220440," And the reason why it doesn't fit is because the reservoir is sitting right there."
3220440,3220840," Yeah."
3220840,3225560," And the case is pretty small, so there's like not really another place to put the reservoir."
3225560,3226120," Nice."
3226120,3228200," So, I like actually don't know what to do."
3228200,3229080," I'll figure something out."
3229080,3233000," I'm going to figure it out this weekend, but like, I don't know."
3233000,3239000," So, wait, you, you are not gaming on it yet."
3239000,3240280," Ah, it's not in there."
3240280,3240840," All right."
3240840,3244440," I, I, I have to redo the whole water cooling loop."
3244440,3245000," Nice."
3245000,3245720," Or something."
3245720,3247080," For an air-cooled card."
3247080,3247480," Yeah."
3247480,3248120," Nice."
3248120,3248680," Yeah."
3248680,3249080," Nice."
3249080,3249640," So like."
3249640,3249960," Nice."
3249960,3253320," I don't know."
3253320,3253880," Cause like."
3253880,3255320," I ******* told man."
3255320,3260200," We used one pre-existing hole, and then we drilled another hole"
3260200,3261560," for mounting the reservoir."
3261560,3261800," Yeah."
3261800,3264760," So, there's potential that I just crank it to the roof,"
3264760,3267000," and the reservoir like touches the top of the case."
3267000,3267400," Cool."
3267400,3272520," And maybe it clears that way, but then there's a tubing run that's like really tight"
3272520,3273800," that goes right across there."
3273800,3276120," The best part is the GPU is not a gift."
3276120,3278440," So he has to go back to his RTX Titan after."
3278440,3281320," So it's not like he can just, you know, take it out of the loop."
3281320,3282120," Yeah."
3282120,3282520," Yeah."
3282520,3283400," It's pretty funny."
3283400,3284120," It's terrible."
3284120,3284920," Yeah."
3284920,3288840," You see, I rise her and prop the card upside the k, outside the case."
3288840,3292280," That's horrible."
3292280,3293400," Spoiler alert."
3293400,3295560," You might see some other solutions kind of like that."
3295560,3301960," Oh my goodness."
3303320,3306200," I would really love to not redo my water cooling loop."
3306200,3309160," So if I can find any other solution, I'm pretty much down."
3309160,3309640," Nice."
3309640,3312280," Yeah."
3312280,3314840," Why don't we talk about CDA?"
3314840,3318360," Actually, why don't we talk real quick about what merch messages are?"
3318360,3323160," Those of you who are new to the show will be seeing these little merch messages down here."
3323160,3328600," People with their little messages popping up, or there's probably some that are curated already."
3328600,3330360," Maybe we'll do a couple of the curated ones."
3330360,3333000," Dan, our producer can read those out for us up."
3333000,3338680," We can't turn his camera on today because he's not wearing LTT store.com merchandise."
3338680,3339960," What is this? A knock to a hoodie?"
3339960,3340840," What?"
3340840,3341240," No."
3341240,3342040," Yeah."
3342040,3346600," I mean, I'm sure it's a quality hoodie, but geez, man, you got to rep them."
3346600,3348600," It's not as nice as the LTT hoodies."
3348600,3350040," Don't lie."
3350040,3350840," I know it's really nice."
3350840,3357960," Anyway, the point is if you want to get our producer, Dan, to check out your question,"
3357960,3362920," maybe curate it for us to address on the show, or if you just want to see it slide on into our"
3362920,3368280," lower third here, the way to do it is to go into LTT store.com and you can pick up a gift card."
3368280,3371320," You can pick up some comfy underwear hoodies."
3371320,3373480," We got all kinds of great stuff over there."
3373480,3376840," And then in the checkout, you'll see a little field, mark merch messages and you can put your"
3376840,3380200," message in and it'll go into our little processing queue here."
3380200,3385800," The reason that we do it this way is that compared to super chats on YouTube, we are more likely"
3385800,3387640," to actually see them."
3387640,3392040," So if you head over here, oh, okay, nobody's actually sent any or maybe they have."
3392040,3392520," Who knows?"
3392520,3393320," Because oh, yeah."
3393320,3393640," Okay."
3393640,3394440," Oh, look at that."
3394440,3396200," It didn't show up here, but oh, okay."
3396200,3396600," Sure."
3396600,3397160," Why not?"
3397160,3399160," Apparently that's how this works now."
3399160,3399720," You know what?"
3399720,3401480," Oh, it did manage to populate the old ones."
3401480,3403240," Maybe YouTube finally saw my thing."
3403240,3403480," Yeah."
3403480,3408280," Either way, if you really want to throw money at super chats, you absolutely can, but"
3408280,3414680," YouTube takes a big chunk of that instead of it all going to creators and effectively you,"
3414680,3419880," because with merch messages, we are still getting a significant cut of what you send."
3419880,3424840," But you are essentially taking the rest, which is the value of the product and getting it back"
3424840,3427720," to yourself in the form of something that you can enjoy."
3427720,3431320," If you really want to throw money at the screen, you can just buy a gift card and then never use"
3431320,3432840," it on lttstore.com."
3432840,3434040," Not that I would recommend that."
3434040,3438680," I don't think you should just throw money away, which is why we do merch messages instead of"
3438680,3439080," super chats."
3439080,3442360," Now I've had a lot of people ask me, okay, Linus, Mr."
3442360,3446040," merch messages are better than Twitch bits or super chats."
3446040,3447480," Why do you leave super chats on then?"
3447480,3450200," Well, people really want to throw money at the screen."
3450200,3450520," Like what?"
3450520,3451800," I'm going to stop them."
3451800,3454920," There's no obligation that we're going to respond."
3454920,3455240," Yeah."
3455240,3456520," I can tell them not to."
3456520,3458200," I can tell them I'm not going to look at it."
3458200,3460920," But like, and we, we, we, we,"
3460920,3462760," It shows it to other chat users as well."
3462760,3463400," Yeah, exactly."
3463400,3464280," So that's their reason."
3464280,3464920," Then go ahead."
3464920,3465080," Yeah."
3465080,3465960," So they really want to do it."
3465960,3470120," Then like cool, but yeah, you should, you should do merch messages."
3470120,3471000," They're, they're better."
3471000,3472440," It's a, it's a better option."
3472440,3472680," Yeah."
3472680,3474120," Cool."
3474120,3474920," Why don't we do a couple?"
3474920,3475480," Dan, hit me."
3475480,3476280," Okay."
3476280,3480600," This one's from Michael, the first annual chiplet summit concluded this week."
3480600,3484200," And I'd like to know, do you believe chiplets will be the future of computers?"
3484200,3489000," Or is it just a patch until better technologies can continue the trend of die aggregation?"
3489000,3491400," So future, future."
3491400,3493000," I think you mean the present."
3493000,3493800," Yeah."
3493800,3494920," Um, yeah."
3494920,3499800," Chiplets are, are well and truly arrived at this point."
3499800,3505240," I mean, man, I saw some, I saw some new like research paper stuff coming out around like"
3505240,3510520," two, two dimensional something or other, some, some new kind of transistor."
3510520,3512600," And I'm like, oh, that Moore's law is coming back."
3512600,3513320," And like, I don't know."
3513320,3513480," Yeah."
3513480,3513880," Man, sure."
3513880,3516840," If that, if that plays out, then, then great."
3516840,3521880," I'm sure that manufacturers would rather create monolithic dies rather than work on these"
3521880,3525560," super complicated interconnects that are necessitated by chiplet designs."
3526200,3531720," But that has, that's not commercially ready yet."
3531720,3537400," And even if the researchers think it is, there's a huge gulf between researchers thinking"
3537400,3539000," something is commercially ready."
3539000,3544440," I mean, how many times have we, have we seen researchers talking about how, how soon solid"
3544440,3549320," state batteries are coming or graphene or, you know, whatever else it is and then real actual"
3549320,3553640," manufacturers of products going like you guys have not considered many of these things that are"
3553640,3555720," real problems in the real world."
3556200,3563400," So yeah, I think that, I think that chip manufacturers would rather create monolithic dies."
3563400,3568520," But if that's not an option, then yeah, we're just going to have to, we're just going to have"
3568520,3573400," to rely on these, on these high speed interconnects that are getting pretty sophisticated."
3573400,3574040," Working very well."
3574040,3574280," Yeah."
3574280,3574760," Yeah."
3574760,3579800," So I'm excited for more 3D stacking, obviously, but"
3581560,3587400," I don't think that 3D stacking is going to deliver, even though it'll help with density,"
3587400,3592280," I don't think it's going to deliver the kinds of cost advantages that consumers have enjoyed"
3592280,3598280," for the last 20, 30, well, 40 years, basically, as long as, as microprocessors have been,"
3598280,3599880," have existed."
3599880,3605800," Because it's, it's just not as cost effective as just, as shrinking the distance between the"
3605800,3611960," transistors. So yeah, I think, I think chiplets, because they help improve yields, because they"
3611960,3618040," help optimize cost. Like we saw this recently on Radeon 7000 series where, man, I'm going to get"
3618040,3622280," the names wrong because it's the kind of thing that I look at in script review, verify, read out"
3622280,3626760," in the video, and then I don't need to think about anymore. But I think it's the cache and memory die"
3626760,3634760," that is on six nanometer. And then it's the compute die that is five nanometer TSMC or whatever it is."
3635640,3640600," Because what they found was that TSMC's five nanometer process doesn't really shrink cache and"
3640600,3646520," memory very much. So they were able to save some money, which, I mean, kind of made its way to the"
3646520,3649960," end product. I mean, it's relatively affordable compared to NVIDIA's products."
3649960,3659960," So it's, it's now, it's the now, and barring some kind of miraculous innovation, it's,"
3659960,3664600," it's the future too. It's been the now for a bit too. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, AMD really"
3665160,3670120," led the way in terms of proving that chiplets could be competitive with monolithic solutions."
3670120,3677880," Next. Yo, Dan, what's up? Oh, sorry. One more. One more."
3677880,3681480," Maybe two more. Merge messages. Let's get really."
3681480,3684840," We'll do more towards the end of the show, guys. It ends up being kind of Q and A."
3684840,3688840," People give us people kind of TS up topics to talk about and stuff like that."
3690200,3695560," Okay. This is a YouTube focused one. This is from Adam. Hey Linus, I'm a truck driver and download"
3695560,3701640," basically all my YouTube content with premium. Does my view time count to YouTube analytics?"
3701640,3706600," 100%. So does with one download, you get a 100% watched?"
3706600,3715480," I believe, oh shoot, I have, I have heard that discussed. I don't remember the answer."
3718280,3721480," I don't think so. Don't quote me on it."
3721480,3729800," Maybe like averages. Yeah, it doesn't do that. No, it either is like Netflix where you come back"
3729800,3737800," online and it updates your viewers, your view stats, right? Or it's 100%. I can't remember"
3737800,3741640," which premium download does that like download to device and you have to use the app to watch it?"
3741640,3748040," Correct. So it probably does that. It probably pays attention to how you actually"
3748040,3752680," watched it. Yeah, that would be very logical. But yeah, there's a lot of confusion among"
3752680,3759480," viewers about how premium actually contributes to creators. It's hugely beneficial to creators,"
3759480,3764040," by the way. And this is even coming from someone who has their own video platform where they would"
3764040,3770280," rather you go subscribe to liplane.com. Premium is great for creators and great for the"
3770280,3776120," sustainability of the platform overall because well, it's a lot more money than you can generate"
3776120,3782280," with an ad with an ad supported view. I can tell you that much. And that even ignores the impact"
3782280,3787720," of ad blocking, for example, even if absolutely nobody was using ad blocking on YouTube paid"
3787720,3795000," subscribers at the rates that premium charges even even not in the highest like the highest"
3795000,3799720," YouTube premium cost countries is so much so much more than ads. Apparently, Spiffing Brit said"
3799720,3804360," that you get 100% wash time. That sounds like the kind of things Spiffing Brit would look into. So"
3805080,3808680," that may not be true forever though. So I don't know, maybe it's true now."
3808680,3812680," It might have been true for the like account that he used or maybe he did watch it locally or"
3812680,3817080," something who knows. I don't know. I don't know. But the point is that the way that the watch time"
3817080,3822200," gets calculated is generally smarter than I think people give YouTube credit for. For example,"
3822200,3828120," if you watch it to X speed, that it fully counts. It doesn't count as half the time. Yeah. Yeah. So"
3828120,3837160," it's by how much of that video timeline you consumed. Okay, one more and then move on. Yeah. Oh,"
3837160,3843160," we didn't even talk about, you know, cool new stuff on LTT store that people could like get"
3843160,3850200," with the things. So we've got new patterns for our for our boxers and we covered it."
3850200,3856280," We got new product. The GPU plushie is here. You've seen the CPU plushie. Now we've got that"
3856280,3861240," GPU plushie. There's no point showing the product page when we can just show what it looks like."
3861240,3865080," That's right. There's your IO. There's your backside."
3865080,3870760," Show us your backside Luke. Show us your backside again. Oh, beautiful. Oh, love it."
3870760,3876520," Got it. There's some fans, I think got some fans on there. Oh, yeah. There's the fans."
3876520,3879800," Basically, it's just a cute little decorative plushie. Yeah, don't overthink it."
3879800,3886120," All right. One more merch message. Then we'll move on to our next topic."
3886200,3890040," Yeah, we'll get there. We'll get there. One more merch message. Okay, this is from Liz."
3890040,3896040," Hi, Linus and Luke. I got a promotion at work. Hey, it's a completely new department though."
3896040,3899720," Oh, really? And he tips on what you would be looking for in a new team member without much"
3899720,3906840," experience. I doesn't sound like a good promotion. Wow, are you sure you didn't just get like"
3906840,3911480," full of luck thrown to the wolves? Yeah, this is interesting. You know what's"
3911480,3916280," really without much experience. You know what's really funny? This really depends on the role."
3916280,3921480," Go for it. Does this remind you of anything that ever happened? Are we going there?"
3921480,3926680," Are we wait for what? Like the recent thing? No."
3926680,3933080," I don't know. I feel like this has happened to me multiple times. I don't know. I don't know."
3933080,3938920," You're talking about that. Are you sure that you weren't just like impossible to deal with in"
3938920,3949000," your current position? Still valid. Mine and Luke's relationship has been often complicated"
3949000,3958120," by my role as his boss. On the one hand, I think we're friends, you know? Like really though."
3958120,3966360," But on the other hand, at one point in time, I was his friend, his landlord, his employer."
3966360,3968840," And I think there was technically like one other thing."
3968840,3972200," All at once. Yeah."
3972200,3976600," No, hold on. Sorry. No, that's not what that one."
3976600,3984840," Anyway, so our relationship has at times been really complicated. So, I mean,"
3984840,3989000," I mean, if he fires me, he doesn't get rent. He's squatting in his house."
3989640,3999000," Right? So any who, there was a period where our work relationship was pretty challenging."
3999000,4007160," And Luke got a promotion."
4007160,4008840," Promotion."
4008840,4011400," You know, why don't I let you talk about it?"
4013400,4020360," It was difficult on both sides. I was a bit of a ****** head head. And there was also some other"
4020360,4024680," things going on. I'm not going to put all of the blame on me. I think a lot of it can go there,"
4024680,4029880," though. I own some. Yeah. 100%. Yeah. The things happen. I had a lot going on too."
4029880,4033240," And then I started doing full plane."
4033240,4043080," And it came with a big, a better title. So it was a promotion in that sense."
4043080,4049400," Not really. Oh, that's right. You had that title at Linus Media Group that probably didn't."
4049400,4053800," I mean, to be fair, it was kind of fake and then it was kind of real. So that's better."
4053800,4055400," Yeah. So there's that."
4055400,4061320," Fake B.S. title. Anywho, that part was an improvement. Yeah."
4061320,4066920," So, are you a shirt? Wasn't that?"
4066920,4072200," I think it depends a lot. So they say any tips on what you do for a new team member"
4072200,4078360," without much experience said promotion. So are you joining as a team member? Are you"
4078360,4082360," leading this team? No, they're leading a completely new department. I think it's basically what"
4082360,4091640," so Luke went from being part of video production at Linus Media Group to being the leader of float"
4091640,4098040," plane. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know what? Yeah. Yeah. I was going to say that. What's cool is that"
4098040,4105240," it actually like super worked. This was it was I think I I think I softened it a lot. I think"
4105240,4110440," probably you have a different memory of how certain things went at that time than are like"
4110440,4113720," actually real and I have receipts for a lot of it. Did I say mom spaghetti?"
4113720,4119880," What? Because I'm pretty sure I said mom spaghetti at some point. Probably. One shot, one opportunity."
4119880,4124680," Oh, yeah, definitely. Okay. So then I was pretty upfront then, I guess. Yeah. About what this was."
4124680,4128440," Like, okay, build something. Yeah."
4128440,4136280," Fucking did it. So there you go. I think honestly, the role change did actually solve a lot of the"
4136280,4144680," problems that like I was having with things. I wasn't sure. Me neither. Like this is worth biting."
4144680,4149640," Yeah. I don't know. I'm really happy with with the team that we have. That's the main thing I'm"
4149640,4155320," happy with. Yeah. Flowplane like existing and working seems like a fever dream. Like the fact"
4155320,4159880," that that even happened at all is like kind of wild. And then we do tons of other stuff at this"
4159880,4166280," point now. Yeah. That's like very impactful. I just on Ivan umbrella corporation, like I just"
4166280,4173720," talked to someone from the inventory team about like how cool the inventory system is. Yeah."
4173720,4178840," I'm going to say their names. One of them I'm 100% certain I can say. The other one I'm 98,"
4178840,4183000," but I think it's okay. Peter and Tyler do a lot of the work on the inventory system."
4183000,4185880," And they launched something recently that was like super cool."
4185880,4192120," Like we do a bunch of infrastructure stuff, not just in Flowplane. Under the umbrella"
4192120,4197480," includes the labs web development team who are killing it under the umbrella includes Conrad."
4197480,4205080," Yeah. Conrad. He's killing it. Like the. Yeah. AJ said going on almost six years now. Yeah."
4205080,4210760," We've been going for a long time. The team's actually like big for a project that so many people"
4210760,4218440," called doomed and continue to call a failure. It's going pretty strong. So yeah. I'm."
4218440,4226360," Hey, hey, Jay, the the the the checks like they clear right? Like I. Six years later still still"
4226360,4233560," still toiling away at this failure of a project. Yeah. Yeah. So I don't know. It is what it is."
4233560,4241560," It worked out. If you're leading it. Yeah. I mean, so then fine. You you did it. Maybe they're"
4241560,4247000," maybe they're being grown to the wolves. It's a sink or swim moment, which is part of the name"
4247000,4252440," of Flowplane. Yeah. Maybe. Okay. What did you how did you build the team? I don't know, dude."
4252440,4259480," Find an AJ and a Yuki as fast as you can. If they're not named that you're doomed. I'm kidding."
4260760,4267400," No, it's it sounds like the team might already exist. If that's the case, there's going to be a"
4267400,4274680," lot of eyes on you. And I think you specifically said without much experience. It sounds like that"
4274680,4280120," might mean that you're lacking confidence here. Try to step into the situation without the lacking"
4280120,4285880," confidence, but try to step into the situation with humility at the same time. Ask the team what"
4285880,4290840," they need, what type of things they think you should move forward on and educate yourself"
4290840,4296200," very rapidly. You've been very kind about it. I totally misread it. Yeah. So they're joining"
4296200,4301640," a completely new department and they want to be. Sounds like they might be a junior member. Yeah,"
4301640,4307400," they want to be what that department is looking for. Enthusiasm. Yes. Ask lots of questions."
4307400,4312360," And don't be afraid to ask questions, but take notes. This might be very"
4312360,4317240," the same question again. Counter current culture, but you might want to put some work in outside"
4317240,4323880," of hours to like familiarize it. I know, I know, I know, but they're they're asking for tips. And if"
4323880,4329880," if you're looking to if you're looking to impress a new department, yeah, be growing and be growing"
4329880,4334360," rapidly. And if you can do that within hours, great, like I'm not you don't have to do this. But"
4334360,4340200," if you're feeling the burn when it's outside of work, you might be able to make your day better"
4340200,4344760," by just prepping a little bit more. The whole without much experience thing, I keep coming back"
4344760,4352920," to that. Don't try too hard. Be yourself. I hate that advice. You gave me a hard time about"
4352920,4358280," dunking on float plane subscribers. Okay, I'll explain why. Jay Citron, we approve. We like"
4358280,4362600," you still. You're still cool. Yes. Stay subscribed. And the be yourself part. Absolutely. Yeah. I'm"
4362600,4366840," not I'm not telling you to be any different, but they don't socially, but they don't try too hard"
4366840,4372120," think. Yeah, don't push yourself to the point where you're exhausting yourself too much."
4372120,4376600," No, I think you misread this. Did I? Yeah, I think it's like, don't try too hard, like be yourself."
4376600,4383400," Like, like, don't laugh too hard, you know? Oh, yeah. Okay. Yeah, then unless you're awful,"
4383400,4389720," then be someone else. What I'm specifically talking about effort level. Sure. Don't I wouldn't"
4389720,4396920," try too hard to necessarily fit like I wouldn't focus too much on being able to sit around the"
4396920,4402920," lunch table. Yeah, without it being awkward. I would focus hard on being a valuable member of the team."
4402920,4405560," Yeah, for sure. Because if you're a valuable member of the team,"
4405560,4408680," people want to talk to you. Apparently you were right. They said that. Okay, cool."
4408680,4410680," Yeah. If you're a valuable member of the team,"
4410680,4415720," it's a good one, right? Even if you don't socially fit in super well, people are like that."
4415720,4420760," You'll still be respected even if you're not like people's BFF, right? And usually if you're"
4420760,4425160," respected because you're a valuable member of the team, that'll just kind of happen with time."
4425160,4429720," K-chirp, this is pretty good. This is a pretty good way of kind of summarizing,"
4429720,4436920," I think what you did a good job of Oculus thing about there. No great boss ever asks"
4436920,4441400," his team to consistently put in work after hours, but they sure do notice it. Yes."
4441400,4446040," That's a really good way of getting it. So a short term burst at the beginning to get yourself"
4446040,4453560," maybe not up to speed, but at least closer? Show some effort is never a bad idea. I was really"
4453560,4460600," impressed when James, James who didn't have a ton of technology coming in here compared to some"
4460600,4467000," of the other writers that we hired, Anthony, Alex, Jake at that time, right? These are"
4467000,4473240," highly technical people who just did tech things for fun for laws. So James coming in, I was really"
4473240,4481000," impressed when he asked for funding to buy this textbook about display technology. It was like"
4481000,4484120," $200 or $300 or something like that. I was like, \"Okay, I'm not buying this,"
4484120,4488280," we're not going to read it, but if you're actually going to read it and he did, then yeah, sure,"
4488280,4493480," yeah, of course.\" And he's like, \"Yeah, I read the whole thing on my own time because"
4494040,4502200," the reality of it is that what you do during work time is work, but what you do outside of"
4502200,4511080," work time, you could almost think of as qualifications.\" Yeah. You were kind of hired based on having"
4511080,4515960," a go-getter kind of attitude. So yeah, by all means, yeah, I didn't ask him to."
4515960,4519800," And you don't want to do this long-term rule. No, it's not sustainable."
4519800,4523480," You're going to burn out really hard. You got to have a life. It's going to be bad for you,"
4523480,4527240," and it's going to be bad for your employer to a certain degree because when you're burnt out"
4527240,4531000," and you're showing up to work, it's... This is a line I know you've heard. You're no good to me dead."
4531000,4538360," Yeah. Yeah. I heard that one a few times. If I see someone going too hard, that's what I always"
4538360,4545320," default to. Like, \"Hey, look, you're no good to me dead.\" Like, yeah, you're a warm body, but you're"
4545320,4551240," not here, right? Yeah. You're better showing up and doing the work than showing up and doing the"
4551240,4556360," work too hard and then burning out and disappearing and doing that cycle a bunch of times. So,"
4556360,4561880," put in a little bit of extra effort at the beginning to get a little bit of a boost on that experience."
4561880,4566680," Yeah. Might be a decent idea or not depends. You're going to have to vibe this out a little bit."
4566680,4571720," It might be a decent idea to kind of ask the team for some resources for things that you can catch up"
4571720,4577480," on. Depending on the vibe though, they might use that as ammo against you. So, it might be a good"
4577480,4582040," idea to find the resources yourself and try to catch up as best you can. It just depends on the"
4582040,4586680," type of people you're dealing with. All right. Why don't we move into our next big topic here."
4586680,4592840," Perfectly good two-year-old MacBooks are getting scrapped because of activation lock"
4592840,4599560," while new ProModels SSDs found to be worse than the predecessor. Ooh, some bad news for Apple this"
4599560,4605640," week. Last week, computer repair store owner John Bumstead claimed that shops like his are being"
4605640,4611400," flooded with MacBooks that cannot be refurbished or resold thanks to Apple's activation lock feature"
4611400,4618840," leaving no option but to sell them for parts or more likely for scrap. The feature, which comes on"
4618840,4624200," Max with the T2 security chip introduced in 2018, allows the user to encrypt their data so that"
4624200,4629880," only the user can access it using touch ID. The problem is that nothing even a factory reset can"
4629880,4637080," disable the lock unless the original owner turned off, find my or used the erase assistant prior to"
4637080,4643160," turning the laptop in. Bumstead says that previous owners are rarely responsive being in large part"
4643160,4647880," companies and schools that are upgrading hundreds or thousands of machines and while he's heard of"
4647880,4652920," ways to bypass the T2 lock, those methods don't survive a reset which would screw over whoever buys"
4652920,4662520," the resold device. As Apple insider points out, Apple does have a process for removing activation"
4662520,4668040," lock from used devices provided that eBay or whatever gave you a receipt but the method doesn't"
4668040,4673880," work if the previous owner hasn't removed the device from their account. Bumstead wants that fixed"
4673880,4680680," like this. Oh, I have a link here apparently. Oh cool. So here's a here's a solution that is"
4680680,4685320," proposed. When we come upon a locked machine that was legally acquired, we should be able to log"
4685320,4689480," into our Apple account, enter the serial and any given information, then click a button and submit"
4689480,4693880," the machine to Apple for unlocking. Then Apple could explore its records, query the original owner"
4693880,4698360," if it really wants to. And then if at the end of the day there are no red flags, the original owner"
4698360,4703000," and the original owner doesn't protest within 30 days, the device should be auto unlocked."
4703000,4708280," It's like never going to fly the house to go through Apple. Absolutely never going to fly"
4708280,4711480," if it has to go through Apple. And even if it didn't have to go through Apple, like one of"
4711480,4716920," the things that I pitched to our writer before even looking at John Bumstead's ideas was,"
4716920,4721720," you know how, okay, no, you probably don't, but okay, Dan, you know how when you're logging in on"
4721720,4726440," an Apple device, it's pretty common for a two factor code to just kind of pop up on your other"
4726440,4731000," Apple device that's logging to the same account. Yeah, we had that a lot the other day. Yeah, I get"
4731000,4735560," that a lot on our teleprompter, which is really annoying. Anytime MAC address is off site shooting"
4735560,4739160," somewhere and it's like, \"Hey, you're logging in from an unusual location. I am trying to read"
4739160,4748760," the script.\" Anywho, you know, I think that it would be pretty chill if the device is still in my"
4748760,4753720," account. If someone else had it and was like, \"Hey, requesting an unlock, I could see Apple selling"
4753720,4763320," that as a feature.\" Hey, for that previous owner or potential theft victim, here's the current"
4763320,4770600," whereabouts of your machine. Did you know about this? That could be pretty useful. And for the"
4770600,4775320," recent acquirer of said machine, it would be great to be able to send a ping to the previous owner"
4775320,4782280," that's like, \"Hey, about this, it's still in your account. Can I use it? That would be great.\""
4782280,4787880," However, that also assumes that everyone would kind of act in good faith in the situation, which"
4787880,4792280," would say fair play here is going to be an issue. Which could be a big problem and I could see"
4792280,4799240," Apple getting stuck as an arbiter of these kinds of disputes, which they're not going to want to do."
4799240,4805000," They won't do it. Yeah. And I think they're going to make privacy arguments about locations of"
4805000,4815800," devices being passed to new owners and things like that. But bottom line is we got to have"
4815800,4823480," some kind of solution, right? And if this other news is anything to go by, the new solution is not"
4823480,4828680," to simply just upgrade to the newest MacBook. In somewhat related news, the SSD and Apple's"
4828680,4834360," newest entry level 14 inch MacBook Pro, since this is with the M2 Pro processor 512 gigs of storage,"
4834360,4841640," it is significantly slower than its predecessor in the 2021 14 inch MacBook Pro, so with the M1"
4841640,4848120," processor and 512 gigs of storage. Though confirmed by multiple reports, evidence was first shared by"
4848120,4856120," Daniel of YouTube channel Zone of Tech, who clocked the 2023 models SSD at just shy of 3 gigabytes a"
4856120,4862680," second, right? And 2700 megabytes a second it reads. And that is, wow, half a gig and over a"
4862680,4869800," gig slower respectively than the 2021 model. He guessed correctly that Apple is apparently"
4869800,4874840," pulling the same thing that they did back in June, replacing the dual NAND chip configuration in the"
4874840,4881240," M1 model with a single chip. And this was confirmed by YouTuber Max Tech and nine to five Mac. Tom's"
4881240,4886440," hardware further notes that the new M2 Mac mini feature similar SSD performance degradation compared"
4886440,4895800," to the M1 Mac mini from 2020 confirmed by Twitter user at Table Rown and YouTuber Brandon Geekabit."
4897480,4903000," I mean, the new one comes in $100 less than the original MSRP, but like, what is, what is the deal"
4903000,4911800," with this? It's kind of whack. Like really? Not a fan. I wonder if it's, I wonder if it's like the"
4911800,4918920," YouTube quality thing in what way. I wonder if they like, no people don't care. Yeah, I could see that."
4918920,4924280," I mean, it's just, it just sucks though, right? Like as a consumer, if I buy M2,"
4925480,4931960," is it not a fair assumption that it is better in every way than M1? Just as good or faster. Yeah."
4931960,4937000," I mean, there are certain situations where sure, I can, I can see some justification for this. Okay,"
4937000,4943160," so say for example, an electric car. If you go with a top performance spec, it might have less range."
4943160,4949320," But there's a, there's a, there's a logical reason for that. If I get an M2 processor,"
4949320,4953720," theoretically, I would expect it to have a better storage controller. Like it shouldn't"
4954680,4959560," like go that that's not that the only thing you could reasonably really assume is that maybe the"
4959560,4964600," battery dies faster. Sure. Yeah, maybe in the same kind of, it exactly exactly the same sort of"
4964600,4969640," tradeoff. Yeah. But yeah, no, I think you're absolutely right. I think it's pretty clear that"
4969640,4975400," Apple is taking a, you know, whatever these clubs won't notice approach. You know, realistically,"
4975400,4980920," it's less about the hardware and it's more about the experience. It's more about the ecosystem."
4980920,4987000," And it's just, it's frustrating. And the thing is like, I'm not the one who should be mad about this."
4987000,4997560," Yeah. Apple users are the ones who should be mad. And yet it feels like Apple's users are the ones"
4997560,5003160," most likely to just take it. Not really care. Over and over and over and over again. I don't"
5003160,5007080," understand it. Which is probably why they're doing it. I don't know. I really suspect it's the,"
5007080,5011560," man speaking of which I've brought up the YouTube quality a few things, the YouTube quality thing"
5011560,5020040," a few times today because it's plaguing me. It will refuse to play any video that I open at"
5020040,5027160," anything other than the lowest possible quality. And I have to change it every single time. Nice."
5027160,5032920," There's no learning happening because I do it every single time. Nice. And out of spite,"
5032920,5038040," I put it on the maximum possible one. Despite that, like, I don't need that necessarily."
5038040,5042680," I'm usually playing it in a small window on a side monitor. I don't care. But no. Now it's going"
5042680,5048280," full. Take that screw you, man. Take that. I'm so annoyed. I have a feeling that like, because I'll"
5048280,5054280," leave open like, say the lo-fi thing or whatever, because I'll like just listen to music or it's"
5054280,5059480," on my speaker. So the birds will hear it or whatever. I, I play for premium, but boy use it."
5060680,5067000," But I'm like wondering if they're like, oh, it's, he's using too much. Let's make him use less or"
5067000,5074200," something. I don't know. But wow, that's annoying. I don't know. Going back to the, the locks on the,"
5074200,5078360," on the MacBooks, like, and then there's a lot of different ways that you can kind of try to tackle"
5078360,5083080," this, right? Like obviously, if you just had removable SSDs that are not tied to the T2 chip,"
5083080,5086920," that would address the refurbishing issue. The main issue is data privacy, right?"
5087640,5092760," But that wouldn't, well, no, the other main issue is device ownership, right? Like we talked"
5092760,5098440," just last week about the benefits of encrypting devices. Reduces the value and stealing one."
5098440,5105160," Exactly. It makes them worth so much less for a thief. And so it's not like I don't understand"
5105160,5110280," the benefits of doing it this way, but there has to be a way to tackle it, right? So one of the,"
5110280,5117000," one of the ideas here was from jam amp, have students or parents, you know, sign that they"
5117000,5122520," agree to pay for locked laptops that are returned. You know, instead of shifting the blame to Apple,"
5122520,5125640," shift the blame to the users who are not unlocking these bloody things."
5125640,5131640," Yeah, like it was said that if it's like, last week, computer repair, stop owner claimed that"
5131640,5135800," shops like his are being flooded with Macbooks that cannot be referred. They're coming to you"
5135800,5140200," directly, it sounds like. So just try to get them to do it at the door. Obviously, if it's a school"
5140200,5144760," that delivery person might just be like, huh, just leave them. But like,"
5144760,5151320," some effort should be done there, I think. There's got, there has got to be a way to do this."
5151320,5156840," And if Apple actually cared about the environment, the way that they posture that they do,"
5156840,5162920," then they would solve it. Like, let's, let's be real here. Their R&D budget has enough room in it"
5162920,5169720," if they were legitimately motivated to deal with this problem that they could find a solution."
5169720,5173720," And it's one of those things where I realize I'm coming in here, just kind of going, yeah,"
5173720,5178200," here's a problem. See you later. Like, I don't, I don't have the perfect solution."
5178200,5184760," But I also, I'm not the one who should have to. Like, I'm not the one who is manufacturing"
5184760,5192600," mountains of e-waste that do not need to be shredded. I'm not the one saying, oh, just care so huggy"
5192600,5198200," muggy much about the environment that we, I make the greenest devices ever. That's you."
5199400,5204840," That's you. That's you. You're the one doing that. It's Apple's hypocrisy that bothers me so"
5204840,5210440," much about them. I saw, I saw comment on, on a flip-plane exclusive recently that was Jonathan"
5210440,5215160," Horst reacting to something or other from Apple, like their new announcement of something. And it"
5215160,5220040," was like, you know, corrupted him. The longer he works there, the more he sounds like a, like a"
5220040,5225000," cynical, like non-macked person. I'll tell you something about Jonathan Horst. So he was hired"
5225000,5232200," because he is analytical and maybe a little cynical, but still loves Apple. That was exactly,"
5232200,5237480," that was exactly who we were looking for for a role like that because we didn't want to be"
5237480,5242040," like every other Apple channel where we just go, oh, yes, yes, please, please just put it in my mouth."
5242040,5250200," Right? Like we wanted to, we wanted to love Apple, but not in like a super submissive kind of way."
5250840,5254840," We're not talking 50 shades here. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We're talking like a healthy relationship."
5254840,5258840," 50 shades of space gray. Okay, that's pretty good."
5258840,5259400," Thanks."
5259400,5262920," The best line of the wine show right there. I'm going to try to top that, but I'm a fail."
5262920,5271240," Anywho, right off of that, should we go into sponsors?"

5433800,5442520," Seasonic. They make power supplies. They go on computers. Yeah. Yeah, they're good. Yeah. Yeah."
5442520,5445720," Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Are you just not going to do the talk?"
5445720,5450120," No, I'll just talk. Okay. All right. The Prime TX-1000 watt is a great choice for a high-performance"
5450120,5455160," system. It features 80-plus titanium efficiency, which means less power gets wasted. It's fully"
5455160,5460280," modular. It features hybrid fan control to control overall fan noise and a fluid dynamic"
5460280,5465640," bearing fan, which means longer lifetime. Plus, it comes with a 12-year warranty. A 12-year warranty."
5465640,5473400," What else are you going to still be using in 12 years? Honestly, I mean, you everything,"
5473400,5481000," but I mean them. I mean the consumers, okay? The walking mall. Okay, this is an inside joke"
5481000,5485560," from a previous WAN show. I don't actually disrespect you guys this way. But what did I call them?"
5486840,5489720," You said walking and I immediately sort of racked my brain trying to remember."
5489720,5493800," Yeah. I was like walking wallets or something like that when I was playing my like,"
5493800,5498920," my sort of blunt alter ego. Anyway, the point is if you're building a new system and looking"
5498920,5503240," for a power supply, you can rely on. You can trust Seasonic. Check them out at Seasonic.com"
5503240,5509960," or through the links down below. What do you want to talk about? Oh, we got to do this."
5514280,5518760," Public backlash against Microsoft for reducing gamers power bills."
5518760,5521000," Okay."
5521000,5531400," This is a new segment we're calling one. This is great. Okay, I will talk you through this. No,"
5531400,5534360," no, no. I don't know. I don't know. I'm going to give her to read it. Okay."
5534360,5541000," Microsoft issued a recent press release announcing a new optional shutdown mode as an alternative"
5541000,5545480," to the previous sleep mode. So sleep, I think we're all pretty familiar with the concept, right?"
5545480,5550920," The device goes into a very, very, very low power state but is still on effectively."
5550920,5557160," There's still juices flowing through the silicon. Okay. But the benefit is that it wakes up really"
5557160,5562440," fast. Like you need to put some college duty now. So sleep. I mean, it is nice. Yeah, it's great."
5562440,5567480," Sleep is good. I love sleep. Yeah. Who needs sleep? Yeah. Well, you're never going to get it."
5567480,5573160," Who needs sleep? Tell me what's that for? Fair neat ladies. Anyway, the point is politicians"
5573160,5580280," and media figures decried the move as an attack on gaming with one Fox news segment describing"
5580280,5587080," Microsoft's change to the Xbox's power settings as a conspiracy targeting children. This is,"
5587080,5594280," this is despite only 20% of US gamers being under the age of 18. And despite that being a"
5594280,5602040," phenomenally L take. Representative Troy Nells. I don't know how to pronounce this."
5602040,5608680," An elected official. Okay. I told the new writer not to editorialize but this is really funny."
5608680,5613080," Representative Troy Nells, an elected official and adult man, tweeted."
5613080,5619720," They want to take your guns. They want to take your gas stoves. And now they want to take your"
5619720,5628440," Xbox. What's next? I love that. Sorry. That's a, that's a good line. That editorialization gets"
5628440,5632920," the thumbs up. Fox likewise published an article subtitled."
5632920,5643400," Woke Brigade. I wish this was fake. But no, I am actually on Fox news.com. Woke Brigade is after"
5643400,5648920," video games. So is this how they branded it? Because I don't understand having the option to shut"
5648920,5656200," down. Being a bad thing. Like I genuinely being as open to other ideas as possible."
5656200,5661480," Alternative ideas. Yes. Go ahead. I don't get it. It's just an option to shut down."
5661480,5666600," It's not mandatory, right? It's an option. You can still sleep it. Right. Am I missing something?"
5666600,5671960," Is anything actually changing? They just have another button, right? They have one more button."
5671960,5675160," Did anything else change? They are automatically applying the new mode."
5676360,5683800," But you can go back to the old mode. So it goes into it. So, so shut down mode takes about 15 seconds"
5683800,5691640," to turn on. So right now, yes, if I press the button on my controller and I say like Xbox turn"
5691640,5699080," off in the past, it would have gone to sleep. And now it shuts down. Yes. If I say Xbox go to"
5699080,5704280," sleep, does it go to sleep? Well, yeah, you just change it to go to sleep mode. But I have to go"
5704280,5710120," into a menu that does it. Yeah. Which you're a slack jawed, drooling gamer. So you probably can't"
5710120,5720440," handle. I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't understand. It's an option. I wish this was fake."
5720440,5726680," Rick DeVos, a political commentator and owner of the Orlando Magic said,"
5726680,5731560," \"Just another small marker on the shoot. We are zooming down where every functionality,"
5731560,5736280," experience, and general service level degradation is celebrated as a great and glorious victory"
5736280,5741800," for the planet/justice, etc.\" I don't think it's a great and glorious victory. I think it's an option."
5741800,5751560," Do you think they would have gotten less flame if they didn't make it the new default?"
5751560,5759400," No, I don't know. Hard to say. Hard to say. This is great. Alongside Fox's article,"
5759400,5763400," which is apparently playing media in the background. Thank you very much. I will navigate away from"
5763400,5773080," that site now. Fox included helpful, a Boomers guide to what an Xbox is imagery. A Microsoft"
5773080,5778920," Xbox controller is seen at the Electronic Entertainment Expo or E3 in Los Angeles, June 17, 2015."
5778920,5784520," Xbox has remained one of the chief major video game console companies alongside PlayStation and"
5784520,5792440," Nintendo. Actually, it would be Microsoft has remained one of the chief video game console"
5792440,5797160," companies alongside Sony and Nintendo, but good try. I mean, I'm being pedantic, but frankly,"
5797160,5804520," you're asking for it. Master Chief, the protagonist of the Halo series in the Xbox Series X,"
5804520,5809880," \"I enjoy Halo\" from 2019. The Halo series is one of the main intellectual properties"
5809880,5817720," associated with the Xbox brand, if not its flagship. Cool. So our writer, who I told"
5817720,5824200," not to editorialize too much, called these Figure 1 and 2, Local Boomer explains what an Xbox is."
5824200,5832040," Okay, again, I think I do. I've been, I've talked against a lot of the editorialization."
5832040,5835880," I think, again, this one's actually probably pretty fair. If you have to explain to someone"
5835880,5842120," what an Xbox is, you're going to sound like a boomer. This is great. So the shutdown or"
5842120,5847160," sleep options have always been there. All they did was change the default one. And the idea is that"
5847160,5853560," it's only, okay, so here, it's not a lot of power when it's sleeping. I think it works out too."
5853560,5856920," Okay, wait, wait, wait. It's like one and a half. What is it going to do the default though?"
5856920,5862040," You press the button? Yeah. Is that the only case? Because I feel like if you voice control and"
5862040,5865080," you tell it to sleep, it's going to sleep. And if you voice control and you tell it to shut"
5865080,5869960," off, it's going to shut off. I don't Xbox. Neither of us Xbox. Yeah, neither of us know."
5869960,5877720," Yeah, let us know. I at least know what it is. Master Chief Xbox. No, it's Halo. Intellectual"
5877720,5885560," properties. Anywho, it's, it's not a lot of power. It's, I think it's like a watt and a half or"
5885560,5891160," something. Like it's a very, it's a very small amount. But on average, Microsoft expects this"
5891160,5897400," to save gamers about a dollar a month on their power bill. And when you factor in that there are"
5897400,5903560," literally millions of these machines sitting idle, it's actually a substantial savings."
5903560,5911480," And you would think in a place where not that long ago, there were like rolling blackouts,"
5911480,5918920," like in large regions of the country because of like a power crisis, that any sort of effort"
5918920,5923800," to save power would be, would be welcomed. And you would think that"
5923800,5937240," if a concern would be the strain on the grid of things like electric car charging and that being"
5937240,5944040," a good reason to, you know, keep using fossil fuels for to power vehicles,"
5946280,5951800," you would think that if that's a legitimate concern for you that any effort to save power would be"
5951800,5958760," welcome. But I just, I get so apparently, apparently they're mad because of how it was"
5958760,5961640," worded. Carbon aware?"
5961640,5970440," Yeah, it was advertised as like a carbon aware update. But imagine getting hung up on like words."
5971960,5980600," Imagine that like, yeah, I don't get it. I still don't get it. Just because"
5980600,5985720," I get an option and you can change it. I apparently they're also upset about the whole slippery slope"
5985720,5991960," thing. But again, it's an option and you can change it. I have like the exact opposite anger"
5991960,5998200," with the switch. I hate that the switch cannot be turned off. Yeah, it's so annoying. This is a"
5998200,6002920," battery powered device. I want it to work the next time I pick it up. The next time I pick it up"
6002920,6008280," might not be for like a week. I don't want it to go to sleep. I want it to shut down. It doesn't"
6008280,6012680," take that long to turn on just like, come on, you know what, it takes a long time with the switch?"
6012680,6018120," Initial charging before you can use it. Yeah, if it's dead, it's going to stay dead for like a"
6018120,6024120," really long time before it allow you to turn it on. That's super annoying. I want it to shut down."
6024120,6028920," That's not because of power consumption reasons. That's because I want it to work the next time"
6028920,6036760," I pick it up. That actually annoys me a lot. This is very confusing to me. You can't voice control"
6036760,6041240," an Xbox series. Is that what the new one's called? Just series? Yeah, it's really stupid."
6041240,6047080," Microsoft's naming scheme for Xbox is actually the worst thing. You can definitely power off the"
6047080,6051800," switch. Yeah, but you have to like hold press the power button for a while and then navigate to it."
6052360,6056120," Just pressing the button doesn't power it off. And I don't think you can change a setting to make"
6056120,6065720," that happen. Maybe you can. I don't know. It's just annoying. You mad, bro? I just don't get it."
6065720,6070760," I'm more confused than mad. I'm far more confused than mad. I don't think I'm mad at all. I think"
6070760,6075560," looking at it from the outside, it's just funny. Like seeing them talk about like, this is the"
6075560,6083720," halo and stuff is just entertaining. But I don't get why you'd be upset because it is so easy to"
6083720,6088440," change back. I can totally understand like, hey, okay, every day you come home from work,"
6088440,6094600," you play an hour of Xbox or something. And you've only got your fixed amount of time because that's"
6094600,6099560," when like the kids come home or something and now you have to do whatever. And you don't want"
6099560,6102600," to wait that extra amount of time. You want to turn it on? You want to work? Okay, sure. Just"
6102600,6105800," have it go to sleep every time. Who cares? It costs you a dollar a month."
6105800,6111560," Okay, really? I mean, I'm mostly just kind of rallying you up right now. So the problem"
6111560,6117240," is just in the way that it was messaged as being green and eco-friendly and carbon"
6117240,6123320," carbon conscious. I still don't get why they care. And all that kind of well, because for a certain"
6123320,6131720," group of people, the burning of fossil fuels and the emissions that we put into the environment"
6131720,6138360," are a non-issue and a fabrication that are scaremongering. I saw a really interesting clip of someone"
6138360,6142840," asking Greta Thunberg, Thunberg, Thunberg, I can't remember. The point is,"
6142840,6148680," you know, asking her really uncomfortable question, which was it was something along the lines of"
6148680,6155480," it's unseasonably warm here in Davos. So where's your climate crisis now? Are you actually,"
6155480,6160360," I can't, she laughed and they're like, yeah, she had no response. No, she had a response. Her"
6160360,6167480," response was, you're a flippin' idiot. And you are undeserving of actual words. That was the"
6167480,6172120," response. You just didn't understand it because you're a flippin' idiot. My thing is, if you"
6172120,6176760," believe all that, just why do you care? Like, why do you, it's just an Xbox like..."
6176760,6182440," Yeah, but like now it takes 15 seconds to turn on. Like if you don't, if Xbox..."
6182440,6184520," If Xbox... Change that one setting. And realistically..."
6184520,6187240," Let's flip the story. Can you figure out how to change that setting?"
6188600,6192280," Yeah. No, but you can, but then. Oh, my gosh."
6192280,6201880," If we flip this around and Microsoft is like, you know what? Let's pump it. We're all tired of"
6201880,6205960," boot times, right? Boot times suck. We're changing the default behavior from sleep. I"
6205960,6209320," understand that's not what it is. We're changing the default behavior, sorry, we're"
6209320,6214120," changing the default behavior from turning off to sleep. Yeah. Because you know what? It's worth it."
6214120,6219160," Megawatt. You send the extra buck 'em back. Megawatt. Screw the power grid. Nobody cares."
6219160,6224520," Screw 'em all. Sleep is great. More power. No boot times. I don't care."
6224520,6230920," Because I can still change the setting, right? Yes. Why does it matter? You can change the"
6230920,6234680," setting anytime you want. I'm gonna be like, that's weird. And then change the setting."
6234680,6238600," If I want it to shut off, which if I own an Xbox, I would want it to shut off."
6238600,6243720," Because I'm probably not gonna use that often. But, I mean, I do own an Xbox. Wow."
6243720,6247160," I forgot. I don't use it that often. I'm happy it's off."
6247160,6253960," But if I used it every day and there has been times like I played Halo, I played a ton of Halo"
6253960,6258680," 2. If I was playing Halo 2 as much as I did back then, maybe I'd want it to sleep."
6258680,6263000," I was a kid at that time. Maybe my dad wants it to turn off. I don't know. But like,"
6263000,6267720," it's an option. I don't care what the company thinks. Why would I care what the company thinks?"
6267720,6272520," Well, what if they take away your sleep later? Slope. Then they're jerks."
6273480,6277400," And then you can buy a PlayStation. Yeah. Like, honestly, the consumer"
6277400,6281640," chooses at the end of the day. But then again, the consumer chooses unwisely a lot."
6281640,6284840," Oh, all the time. Microtransactions. Let's talk about that. I don't want to talk about"
6284840,6288680," microtransactions. This is a really great though. Dark 24 on float plane."
6288680,6293720," Every time a user saves power on Xbox, I have to leave on another light to combat the saving."
6293720,6296760," Now what?"
6296760,6302040," I can't plug any more lights. I'm out of lights now."
6303240,6308280," I'm dark 24 and I don't have any lights. I'm going to be late 24."
6308280,6315800," Light bright. I just don't, because it's entirely in your control, I just don't understand why"
6315800,6319960," people care. It's just, it's the outrage cycle. It feels like they didn't have anything to"
6319960,6324760," care about that day. Yes. I'm agreeing with you. So they just threw at this because there's"
6324760,6329880," nothing else to throw at, which is just like, that's whatever. I just, I think you will be a"
6329880,6334120," happier and more fulfilled person if you care about things that matter. And I'm not saying"
6334120,6338440," that the things that matter you have to agree with me on. Maybe we're at odds. As long as you"
6338440,6343880," think it matters, it's fine. I had the power consumption numbers wrong. Series consumes 11 to"
6343880,6350200," 13 watts, according to the Catelier in Twitch chat in standby mode and 0.5 watts in off mode."
6350200,6355160," So it's like 10 watts. It's like something. Yeah. So about about a buck a month, apparently."
6355160,6357160," Cool. All right. Let's talk about your butt."
6358120,6364840," Okay. Yeah. How's it going? It's Canadian. It's Canada's, it's Canada's butt."
6364840,6374920," Triple A Canadian beef. Yeah. Cam. Okay. So more specifically, Linus has had one of"
6374920,6380120," Ludwig's bidets. Oh, yes. I think they have a name, right? Yeah. Ludwig's bidets."
6380120,6384600," White plus. I have the swipe plus in my bathtub. How's the swipe plus going? Yeah. It took me a"
6384600,6389640," while to get it installed because North American bathrooms don't have a lot of power in them."
6389640,6395880," That's true. You'll usually get one, what is it? EFI, grounded outlet or whatever it is,"
6395880,6401240," by the sink for your shaver or charging you toothbrush or whatever and not much else."
6401240,6408440," So you won't typically have an outlet anywhere near floor level or near the toilet because water"
6408440,6413800," and bathrooms are totally a thing. And so. Wow. The SEO for this is kind of rough. I"
6413800,6418440," Googled swipe plus and it was like far down. Yeah. Huh?"
6418440,6422600," Look, a lot of tops not working anymore. That's interesting. Well, it's not the first one."
6422600,6425320," It's not the second one, not the third. Not the fourth one. Did you try turning it on?"
6425320,6430920," It's the seventh. Anywho. I'm sure you're at my court. So I had to get a power outlet put into"
6430920,6436920," my bathroom. So that took a little while. But now that I've got it, this is not my first experience"
6436920,6443640," with a bidet. Yeah. My first traveled. Yeah. My first time using one was when we went to Japan."
6443640,6451080," And basically, I think I've told this story before, but as we were driving to somewhere"
6451080,6459720," far from the airport, I had to use a rest stop bathroom. And I was blown away by the quality"
6459720,6464920," and cleanliness of it. Totally. On the side of the road, and it was probably the nicest bathroom I"
6464920,6472600," had ever been in in my life, including like washrooms at multi-million dollar hotels in Vegas and"
6472600,6479240," stuff like that. It was just, wow, this is a really nice bathroom. It doesn't smell like"
6479240,6485240," rest stop bathroom at all. Yeah. There's a unique scent to that. Yeah. It's amazing."
6486680,6497000," And I have to confess. I was sitting there going like, man, imagine sitting at a business meeting."
6497000,6503880," Because if there's a Japanese stereotype, it would be that culturally, there's a lot of focus on"
6503880,6511000," business. Sure. Not everyone, obviously. But I think it's pretty fair to say that"
6512440,6517000," Japanese business has definitely been a core part of their culture for a very long time."
6517000,6527080," And the first thing I thought was, man, if I was sitting at the boardroom table with some,"
6527080,6533320," you know, filthy foreigner who I knew had a stanky undercarriage, would I feel like I had the upper"
6533320,6539960," hand? Yes, sir. I can't help it."
6539960,6549880," I'm going to own this guy in his business deal because his butt isn't washed from it."
6549880,6557560," He can't even clean himself like an animal. Disgusting. That's funny."
6557560,6562920," Now with that said, you know, came back to came back to North America where bidets are not common."
6562920,6569480," And you were a stanky butt. And I was a stanky disgusting foreigner, you know, using this like,"
6569480,6573160," what? Like, like, toilet paper, I'm sitting here going like, yeah, why do we do this?"
6573160,6576600," We literally manufacture this so that we can flush it down with toilet."
6576600,6582120," It's like the best example of manufactured waste. Yeah. It's like, it's like, running on it."
6582120,6586040," It's like running on it. It's like, imagine your whole job is to produce toilet paper."
6586040,6591800," You spent your whole life running on a treadmill producing absolutely nothing of value, like great."
6593240,6599640," Right. Like it's like, it's emblematic of just the pointlessness of everything."
6599640,6605000," Toilet paper production. So yeah, I came back and I was like, okay, I guess I'll use toilet paper"
6605000,6610040," now. But I was, but I've always been like kind of curious about it. Like, or not curious about it."
6610040,6614120," I've always been kind of like interested in upping my game. And so when Yvonne and I"
6614120,6617400," ran out of the house, I was like, Hey, do you want to put in like fancy toilets? And she's like,"
6617400,6623320," I don't really care. I'm like, okay. I kind of over it. That was the effort."
6623320,6626840," Yeah, I was about it because I like, I've been to fancy toilet stores at like,"
6626840,6632200," Aberdeen Mall and stuff like that. We haven't had a lot of options in North America for a long time."
6632200,6636680," Oh, you can get them. Yeah. You just got to go to like the more, the more Asian style"
6636680,6641160," talking centers and stuff. Yeah. So like at Aberdeen Mall, I remember stopping by this like"
6641160,6646360," fancy toilet store where like they start at like $1,500 and go go into thousands, right?"
6646360,6650040," All these like heating and pulsing features and all that. Anyway,"
6650040,6654440," when Ludwig's thing came along and I was sitting here going, Hey, we've had such success with the"
6654440,6659080," Jerry Rig everything knife on LTT store. Why don't we like carry more creator merch? Okay. Sure."
6659080,6663960," But obviously I'm not going to just carry something without verifying that it's not crap."
6663960,6672200," And I can verify it is not crap. Cool. You know, it's, it's not the highest end option on the"
6672200,6676200," market. It's designed to. It's not priced that way either. No, it's not. It's designed to be"
6676200,6681800," retrofitted to your existing toilet. They have a non heated non, you know, uh, so that's the"
6681800,6686760," swirder drying. Yeah. The regular swipe is pretty darn affordable and it's just 50 bucks."
6686760,6690360," I didn't know it, but it's also just a nozzle that sprays cold water at your"
6690360,6695880," finger. Does that make sense? Yeah. It's priced accordingly. Pucker up. Yeah. And then the swipe plus."
6695880,6704440," Thank you for that. And then the swipe plus has the heated C and the lighting, you know,"
6704440,6710520," so the water doesn't look yellow and yucky and like it has like a carbon filter in it so that,"
6710520,6716040," you know, it takes the toilet water from the, from the dryer or like the toilet smell from the"
6716040,6721560," dryer and does it just like pump it out into the room and all that kind of stuff. And yeah, it's been"
6721560,6731960," let me just say that feeling clean. Well, no, I, we don't have one here at work and I did, you know,"
6731960,6737320," I thought we in the lower bathroom here. I didn't use it. Yeah. There is one there from that"
6737320,6744200," Amazon. We got choice. Clean, but dirty, but I feel advantageous right now. There you go. There"
6744200,6754520," you go. Boys and winner. I, I've had one for a while when there was that toilet paper scare"
6754520,6759640," with the pandemic. Mm. I had already been thinking about getting a bidet. And then I was just like,"
6759640,6764360," you know what, let's just remove ourselves from this equation right now. And to be clear,"
6764360,6769160," you can still use a little bit of toilet paper. In fact, I'd recommend it just for like drying off."
6769160,6775480," We do, but you use a very, very significantly lower. So much less like where you need like a"
6775480,6781560," mitt to, you know, deal with some of the. You don't need a mitt anymore. Yeah, you don't need a mitt"
6781560,6786440," anymore. It's you just need, you just need some like drying based some extra drying. And mine has"
6786440,6791000," like a fan thingy. So you can get most of the way there. Yep. Yep. But I mean, you're sitting there on"
6791000,6797560," your phone anyway. Yeah. Might as well turn on the drying fan. Yeah. So like, if you spend the whole"
6797560,6803400," time, it's fine, but whatever. So we would still get toilet paper, but like other people are like,"
6803400,6808360," I need like all this amount to like make it through whatever amount of time. So I got"
6808360,6813800," very many people in for us, like for the two of us to get through a roll is going to take like a"
6813800,6818440," long time. Yeah. Whereas before it was like gone, right? So I don't know, that was, it's been good."
6818440,6827560," And when I, I try coming for your toilet paper next. Oh geez. When I traveled to France and then"
6827560,6835000," Greece, that was two weeks of not being able to use it. And yeah, I felt gross. Yeah. I didn't"
6835000,6839640," like feel like, Oh, I'm like significantly cleaner or anything after we got it. It just felt kind of"
6839640,6845960," neutral. Yeah. But then not having it. I'm like, Oh, yeah, no, I get it. Yeah. Like, I can go both"
6845960,6850520," ways at this point. We only have one on the one toilet. I'm going to get around to putting like"
6850520,6854200," regular swipes on the other ones, because I'm not going to get power plugs put into every bathroom,"
6854200,6864120," just use like put like whatever. But I do, I do prefer it. I will say the swipe plus with the"
6864120,6869000," warmed water is definitely a plus. The warm air to the cold water. The warm water is nice."
6869000,6875640," It's a difference maker. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The thing is in like the guest bathrooms or whatever,"
6875640,6880120," people might not even use it. Yeah. I wouldn't want to drop a bunch. I wouldn't bother. Yeah. Yeah."
6880120,6887320," I need to use the washroom real quick, because I drank a lot of water before the show started. So,"
6887320,6890760," here's the question. I'm going to talk about. Are you going to use the bidet toilet or not?"
6891320,6894120," Well, I will, but I'll be back fast enough that it won't have been that."
6894120,6900680," Okay. So, I guess I'm supposed to find a topic. You can merge message."
6900680,6905160," I can do merge message. Okay. I'm going to steal one. Dan isn't even here, I think. Is Dan here?"
6905160,6909560," Nope. Nobody's here. I'm alone. So, I'm going to find a merge message."
6909560,6916360," I want to find ones that I should actually answer, and that shouldn't be answered by a"
6916360,6924760," Linus. So, this might take a second. You're going to have to stick with me. I'll jump on this one."
6924760,6928440," I haven't even fully read it yet, but I think I can answer it. High Linus, Luke, and Dan, or in"
6928440,6934200," this case, just Luke. I'm an aspiring game developer, and I'm about to release my first indie game on"
6934200,6940120," Steam. That's super cool. Congrats. That's awesome. If you guys could create your dream game,"
6940600,6946280," what kind of features or content would you choose? Linus isn't here, but I know that,"
6946280,6952200," oh, what's the name of it? Ah, there's a game that he likes a lot, which is like,"
6952200,6959080," no, pixel art, kind of top downy puzzle and RPG game."
6959080,6965880," Final fantasy. My brain went to Rune World, but that's not it. That's definitely not an escape."
6965880,6969240," Ah, what is it called? It's not an old escape. I don't remember the name. Maybe he'll answer"
6969240,6975560," when he comes back, but it's a really cool cross code. Thank you, Dark24. Dark24 found enough light"
6975560,6981320," bulbs. It's cross code. So he like kind of wanted to make a game for a long time and then played"
6981320,6987560," cross code and was basically like, this is what I wanted to make. So there you go. There's a good"
6987560,6994920," example of his. I've always been interested in making games. I've had a lot of different ideas"
6994920,7001160," over the years. Something that I've wanted to do for quite a while now and actually a couple months"
7001160,7008920," ago, I downloaded Unreal Engine because I wanted to start messing around with it and I was messing"
7008920,7013160," around with some things. And then I was like, yeah, this is too much work and kind of stopped and"
7013160,7016840," maybe I'll pick it up again one day. But I've always wanted to make a like,"
7019000,7025560," Dory based firefighting game. I thought that would be really fun. Firefighter simulator. I've never"
7025560,7033560," seen someone do that. There might be good reason. No, that's interesting. Firefighter career mode."
7033560,7037480," Yeah, heck yeah. I think it could be kind of sweet. I think there's a lot of dynamic situations"
7037480,7043640," you could put the player in. I think there's a lot of choice and the world reacts to it."
7044280,7049800," Type of things that could happen that way. I think that could be pretty sweet. The question was,"
7049800,7055000," why is everybody talking about my favorite games? The question was if you could create your"
7055000,7058440," own dream game, what features of content would you choose? And I brought up cross code. Oh, okay."
7058440,7067640," Yeah. Firewatch. I thought Firewatch was, I think that's a completely different thing. Yeah,"
7068440,7075400," story based, yeah, it's like a story based about living in a forest. Yeah, I don't think it's"
7075400,7079400," you're not a firefighter though. No, no. Yeah. Yeah, wasn't that you might deal with fire,"
7079400,7084440," but you're not a firefighter. It's a different thing. Was there a game or was there a book"
7084440,7092040," for the film adaptation? Hold on a second. I don't even know. Anywho, cool."
7093080,7099080," Yeah, there was a film adaptation, apparently. Oh, no, it's coming. Okay. Well, anywho."
7099080,7105640," Film have an adaptation of what? Firewatch. Oh, really? Yeah, but that kind of makes sense to be"
7105640,7111720," over figure. Yeah. CNET. Want to talk about CNET? Yeah, let's do it. Let's talk about CNET."
7111720,7117560," Do you have no idea they were doing this? Yeah, I'll jump on it. CNET issues mass corrections"
7117560,7122760," for AI written articles. Why did they do this? CNET has put a hold on their use of AI to write"
7122760,7129240," articles after publishing over 70 AI generated articles primarily on finance related topics."
7129240,7137320," An additional thing just in case you don't know, finance is one of the highest CPMs you can have,"
7137320,7140280," also known as those are a lot of the articles they're going to make a lot of money on."
7140280,7145960," The first articles were published in November of last year under a CNET money staff"
7145960,7150920," byline only by clicking on that byline could a reader learn that the article was artificially"
7150920,7157800," generated. Despite the claim that these articles were thoroughly edited and fact checked by a"
7157800,7165720," presumably human editor over half now carry corrections. Pretty almost every time we've talked"
7165720,7171560," about open AI, I've brought up the confidently wrong thing. I can't believe they actually just"
7171560,7179720," did this. Mistakes included confusing basic finance terms and making basic financial math mistakes."
7179720,7183960," That's another thing. Dan and I were talking about this before the show. People keep on trying to get"
7183960,7190040," chat GPT to do stuff it's not made to do and then they're like, \"Oh, well, dumb.\" And it's just like,"
7190040,7196600," \"What? Stop making it do math. It's not made for that. What are you doing?\" Oh my goodness. Anyways,"
7197240,7203560," I'm not surprised that was a problem. There are tons of examples of it being bad at math because"
7203560,7210680," it's not made for that. Some corrections stated that CNET replaced phrases that were not entirely"
7210680,7218840," original. Okay. Plagiarism. So yeah, that would be interesting to see the exact examples of that."
7218840,7224600," The editor in chief stated CNET plans to continue using AI tools into the future, of course, there."
7225960,7230360," And to be clear, I'm not against that part. You just need to vet it properly. Like the"
7230360,7237640," \"in quotes\" thoroughly edited in fact checked by an editor. Yeah, it should have just actually been."
7237640,7242120," It sounds like it wasn't. Maybe someone tried to make their job easier or something, I'm not sure."
7242120,7247560," Meanwhile, BuzzFeed announced that they will be using AI to create entertainment content,"
7247560,7252200," but stressed that their newsroom will remain human-generated and stressed that they will not"
7252200,7257160," replace existing workforce with AI. That's the right way to do it. Online Publisher Medium has"
7257160,7263160," announced AI-generated content will be allowed if clearly disclosed, while many publications and"
7263160,7269640," writers that use Medium as a platform have already banned AI-authored works. There have already been"
7269640,7276520," cases of AI-enabled theft, rephrasing, and republication of copyrighted work. Lots of it."
7276520,7281960," Yeah. Just so you know, a technique that could be used to evade traditional anti-plagiarism tools"
7281960,7285640," as one of the problems. Sorry, go for it. I was going to say as I'm going through my Google News"
7285640,7290920," feed, I will often read an article on a site that I wouldn't have otherwise visited because it's"
7290920,7299720," just in my Google News feed where I go, \"Okay, this was very clearly three articles basically"
7299720,7305560," mashed together because it's super redundant in a way that no decent human writer could ever just"
7305560,7310200," navigate away immediately as soon as I figure out that it was AI-generated, but it's a lot of them.\""
7310200,7317080," And so something I want to make clear here is I am very interested in the idea of chat GPT"
7317080,7322280," regurgitating basically word for word, something that someone else has written. I'm looking for"
7322280,7329800," examples of that. If you find examples of that, somehow get them to me. Don't email flowplane"
7329800,7338040," support by the way. We have... I'm not aware of this. That keeps happening."
7338040,7344280," No. Okay. Luke is not flowplane support. No, that's Joe. And Joe's very nice about it,"
7344280,7348440," but it takes up Joe's time. And there are lots of other things that Joe could do."
7348440,7354040," Like supported customers. Yeah. So, like Joe's job. Yeah, which is cool."
7354040,7365560," What was I going to say? Oh, yeah. So what I'm not saying here is that the plagiarized content"
7366360,7374200," got spat out by chat GPT naturally. Oh. What might happen is they fed it stuff."
7374200,7379880," Right. If you feed chat GPT things, it's going to take from it, because it thinks that you want it."
7379880,7385240," It thinks you gave it to it. Yeah. But actually someone else. Yeah. So, like, that could be happening."
7385240,7389720," Or it could just be doing that on its own. I don't know which one it is. I just don't think"
7389720,7394040," we should automatically pin chat GPT for this. If that's what they're using, I don't... They don't"
7394040,7398360," even say that. They might be using something else. It's probably chat GPT. But we don't actually know."
7398360,7404200," Now would be a pretty good time to be like an anti-AI like detection company."
7404200,7407320," Oh, yeah. There's some spinning up. Yeah, but there are."
7407320,7411400," And they're probably going to get some fairly lucrative contracts from like schools, government"
7411400,7417080," agencies, lots of stuff like that. Yeah. I could totally see it. Man. New investment opportunity."
7417080,7426360," Let's go. Oh, I thought he was investing. Hacking the main frame."
7426360,7433240," I'm rage investing into these companies. But yeah, anyways, consequently, there is a massive"
7433240,7438360," surge in demand for AI text detection, as you were just mentioning, especially among educators,"
7438360,7443800," as I just mentioned. Someone in the chat before the show was actually... I don't remember your name."
7443800,7448840," I'm sorry. Someone in the chat before the show was talking about how they teach eighth grade"
7448840,7457560," US history. And they were talking about how they've warned other teachers at their school,"
7457560,7461640," and they're going to be teaching the kids in that class about chat GPT."
7461640,7468120," Because they see it as a valuable research tool. Because I was like, why? How did... Okay, so you"
7468120,7473160," teach history, how did teaching them about chat GPT possibly come up there? And they made"
7473160,7477480," an interesting argument. Yeah, no, there we go. Yeah, it's yeah. No. They made an interesting"
7477480,7484520," argument of the why I'm teaching them how to research. And I'm not teaching them to just trust"
7484520,7491240," it immediately. But it's a step, right? So they can ask questions, they can offboard from that"
7491240,7495080," into more specific searches, they can do whatever. I'm like, oh my goodness, that actually does make"
7495080,7500920," sense. It's just... Very cool. But they had to warn the other teachers, right? Yeah."
7500920,7504600," Because they're going to teach them that and that subject, because it's super powerful tool"
7504600,7508440," in that subject. Especially because it's history. So it doesn't matter that it's not trained on"
7508440,7514360," recent stuff. But other classes might not be super stoked about it. It's interesting."
7514360,7518280," Right. Very interesting. Coming back to what you had said about being"
7518280,7526840," like adamant that chat GPT should be a paid tool, because when things are free, they inevitably turn"
7526840,7533880," into garbage. I read a really good article. I found it on pluralistic.net here. It's from"
7533880,7542280," Corey Doctorow. Anyway, I read it somewhere else, not here, but you should read it. It basically"
7542280,7549560," did a way better job of explaining that thing that you and I are always talking about, but never"
7549560,7555480," do a perfect job of explaining how... You know how I'll refer to... Okay, in one of our pitches to"
7555480,7560440," creators for Floatplane early on. Premium Conways. We would basically say we are not"
7560440,7569000," the Silicon Valley model. Our benefit is that we take a sustainable approach to building this"
7569000,7575240," platform rather than taking VC funding, which will inevitably become a problem at some point."
7575240,7581320," I was never able to properly explain why that will inevitably become a problem."
7581320,7588360," And so this article is called TikToks and Shittafik... Oops. I missed my right button. Well, all right."
7588360,7598200," Shittification. And basically talks about that cycle and how any new platform that is VC-backed"
7598200,7603320," starts out by pleasing its users until it grows a big user base, then moves on to pleasing its"
7603320,7612280," partners, which helps it grow its revenues, then moves on to pleasing itself, which helps it"
7612280,7618520," enrich itself. And so, you know how I've talked a lot about how Amazon used to be great for shopping."
7618520,7626840," My particular favorite feature was people who looked at this item usually bought these."
7626840,7632840," Well, that feature no longer exists because as this article points out, Amazon has reached their"
7632840,7640040," endgame where it is all about generating value for themselves, for their shareholders, where there"
7640040,7646280," is no benefit to having organic search results. There's no benefit to having good pricing. Everybody's"
7646280,7653960," already locked into Amazon. So they point out that out of the first five pages of results for catbed,"
7653960,7661720," 50% of the results are sponsored because effectively buying placement is the only way to get exposure"
7661720,7666680," on Amazon now because they moved past pleasing the customers, which is when we had features like that."
7666680,7668760," Now they've moved past pleasing their partners."
7668760,7675720," That thing to do? Yeah, exactly. You know, happy partner, happy life, right? They've moved past"
7675720,7680760," pleasing their partners. So they just essentially have them all bidding against each other because"
7680760,7684680," that's the only way they can survive, which means the pricing sucks because everybody has to absorb"
7684680,7690440," these exorbitant fees to participate on the platform. And they're just focused on money,"
7690440,7696360," money, money, money, money, money. And anyway, so it's talking about how TikTok is starting to"
7696360,7703480," enter its second stage of notification. It's a really good article, guys. I'll link it in the chat,"
7703480,7709560," go check it out. But it basically talks about how like they have a button to boost creators,"
7709560,7714760," like giving them like a ton of views. And it's the equivalent of the Carney allowing one user to"
7714760,7718440," win the big teddy bear. So they walk around at the fair all day. So people think that it's possible"
7718440,7722280," to win the teddy bear, but then they have a button that makes it so the ball will pop out for everyone"
7722280,7727720," else so they can just collect your money. Yeah, really, really, really good article. So I'll drop"
7727720,7731320," that in the in the chat. So I'll be move on. I forget what you were talking about, but good job."
7731320,7744360," Discussion question. What is it okay to use AI? What will the impact of BuzzFeed's decision be?"
7745320,7751240," What are the pros and cons of anyone being hypothetically able to compete with BuzzFeed's style of content"
7751240,7757160," using AI? I mean, we're gonna see. I'm not even gonna try and speculate how this is gonna play"
7757160,7761080," out, but it's gonna be interesting. That's for sure. Those are those are extremely difficult"
7761080,7767080," questions that I think could be discussed for for many days. And I think there will genuinely be"
7767080,7772760," entire books based around individual questions that were in that whole line of question. A prime"
7772760,7779320," inflow plane chat says, Amazon does this. Customers who viewed items in your browsing history also"
7779320,7786760," viewed, but that's not the one I'm talking about. There used to be one that was customers who viewed"
7786760,7795080," this item ultimately purchased these. So you could kind of rely on crowdsourcing the research. Now,"
7795080,7803080," that probably created sometimes undue momentum for certain skews and might have made bad products"
7803080,7809320," or products that had been replaced by better ones stickier than they should have been."
7809320,7816520," But men every time I used it, I got a pretty good one. If I didn't really care about getting"
7816520,7823240," exactly the right thing, I wanted something that was 95%. It was the best."
7823240,7829400," I don't buy stuff off Amazon, but I do use Amazon and I'll use Amazon sometimes for the"
7829400,7834840," frequently bought together thing because it's a nice way to find adapters and converters and"
7834840,7841480," stuff. I find you can find like the right thing to make that thing work along with the rest of"
7841480,7846360," the stuff that you might have, because it will like link it. And usually if it said frequently"
7846360,7849560," bought together, you know, they will actually work together, which is kind of nice. Yeah."
7851000,7854200," Yeah. Then I go find it somewhere else and buy it there because I don't like Amazon,"
7854200,7859640," which is fair. Yeah. But then you might like them if they were still consumer first."
7859640,7867400," Yeah. Most of my issues with them are about how they treat the people that work for them"
7867400,7873640," at low levels. You mean the contractors that work for other companies that are not Amazon's problem?"
7873640,7881880," Yeah, basically. And I wasn't going to say how they tend to just crush small businesses and"
7881880,7886200," stuff. I don't think they are good. Right. But that's so you'll really enjoy this article because"
7886200,7891720," talking about how like crushing small businesses by out-competing them and then clawing it all"
7891720,7899080," back after is like the whole thing. Yeah. Yeah. All right. What else is there for us to talk about"
7899080,7904120," here? Is there topics left or you just merch messaging it? Wave of faulty GPUs possibly caused"
7904120,7908040," by crypto miners offloading and properly stored equipment. So that happened. Thank you for"
7908040,7911480," preparing that topic. But I don't know that I'm going to talk about it much more than that."
7911480,7918360," Yeah. Apparently the dies are cracking. Yeah, which is bad. Yeah. Oh, Samsung ignores widespread"
7918360,7922920," SSD failures until they get news coverage. Here's some more news coverage. Samsung don't do that."
7922920,7929000," Yeah. Bad. Yeah. Like, stuff that had been barely used were reporting like massive hits to their"
7929320,7934840," estimated durability remaining. And Samsung was like, oh, and then it went kind of viral and"
7934840,7940920," they're like, oh, okay. And you are me. Okay. It's not clear still what exactly the problem is."
7940920,7946600," I think Samsung has some lessons to learn about transparency. If they just said what it was,"
7946600,7950600," then we would be telling you guys, hey, here's what it is. Here's why you shouldn't worry about"
7950600,7955240," it too much. Here's how they're going to fix it. But instead, they're just leaving it a mystery."
7955240,7961720," And you don't want mystery around a storage product. Yeah. So all I can say now is don't buy a 990"
7961720,7970360," Pro. So that's not better, Samsung. You need to do better. Yeah. I don't have anything else to"
7970360,7976680," that's legit. Google dropped support for On Hub. This sucks. On Hub routers, which were first"
7976680,7982120," released in late 2015. So not that long ago. We'll still operate as Wi-Fi routers, but we'll no"
7982120,7987400," longer receive firmware updates. And it is no longer possible to control the router remotely,"
7987400,7995720," nor to access and change settings. We were pretty against cloud control routers, right?"
7995720,8002280," I don't remember. I hope so. Miracchi or whatever. Oh, oh, I know what you're talking about. No,"
8002280,8007000," no, it wasn't Miracchi. It was a it was like a budget Cisco product that you're talking about"
8007000,8012520," the one that you inherited from me that you cannot change the password on, right? Oh, still have a"
8012520,8020680," crap. It was it was an AP. It was someone's like consumer brand. Was it Ruckus's? I don't remember."
8020680,8028280," Hold on. I don't know. It required some kind of account. And then I thought it was Miracchi."
8028280,8032840," Was it? Are you sure it's not? It might. I mean, I don't know. Anyway, the point is that it's a"
8032840,8038200," white box. I plug it in. I know the password. Yeah. I can't believe you still use that thing."
8038200,8042920," Well, I don't now because my permit small, but I still have it."
8042920,8051720," Nice. Apparently, Miracchi is the budget Cisco product. Okay. Yeah. So somehow he ended up with"
8051720,8058200," a router that had licensing that allowed us to change everything. And then he didn't want to pay"
8058200,8063800," for licensing. I get it. And now nothing can be changed, but it does still work. So I guess this"
8063800,8068360," is basically that it's still set to his old password because he was using it for a while."
8068360,8073880," And before it ran out of its licensing, I don't know who did this, probably you,"
8073880,8079960," but someone was wise enough to set it into AP mode. That was probably me. So that its value"
8079960,8084360," would be extended. Yeah. If you can't control it at all, you're not going to want it to function"
8084360,8090360," as a router. So it's an AP mode with a fixed password that you can't change, which is like"
8090360,8098920," a security problem for sure. But it technically works. I mean, theoretically, it's been in a box"
8098920,8103960," for a couple of years, but there is no plan to transition on hub to any other means of control."
8103960,8108680," This sucks. Yep. The Google support page literally suggests buying a new router."
8110440,8114520," Yeah. Oh, man."
8114520,8124360," What Google hardware were you trusted this point? Just their phones? I don't even know if I trust"
8124360,8129960," those to be just EOL. Do you think they're going to EOL pixels? I don't know. Maybe those. I mean,"
8129960,8134440," they EOL the Nexus line. They just acts everything. See you later. Yeah. Yeah, I know we do pixel"
8134440,8138840," now. It's totally different. I mean, remember, okay, tablets. They used to have tablets."
8139400,8141800," What happened in the Nexus 7? Where's that?"
8141800,8146520," Is that it? Google Sketch, man. Yeah, that's what I thought."
8146520,8151400," You might buy a product and then just not have it anymore. Was Google the one that had that weird"
8151400,8159560," camera that was supposed to like automatically record stuff? Hmm. Hold on. That's ringing a bell."
8159560,8165800," AI camera, auto record. Is that is that a thing? Is that a thing that happened?"
8166840,8170920," Yeah, Google clips. Look at this stupid thing. Did they ever actually release this thing?"
8170920,8182280," AI camera. Yeah, here it is. Hey, Peter. Oh, away. Yeah. And it's supposed to like,"
8182280,8189720," all the promotional crap for this was just, oh, man, it was so stupid. It was like videos of"
8189720,8195160," like dogs and stuff or whatever. Why would that be there? Why would you ever have a camera anywhere"
8195160,8203160," unless you intend to do something with it? Man, so dumb. Like, it was just obviously stupid."
8203160,8208440," The second they unveiled it, how did this make it past? How did this make it past some"
8208440,8214200," idiot pitching it and getting like fired? Like, I just don't, I don't get it, you know?"
8214200,8219320," This reminded me of a Kickstarter project. So I will still look at like,"
8219320,8223960," Kickstarter every once in a blue moon because I find it interesting. But ever getting,"
8224680,8231960," you know, hammered by a certain project, I don't back anything anymore. But what I'll do is I'll"
8231960,8236520," try to find the like company page. Hopefully they have a company page instead of just a Kickstarter"
8236520,8241960," page. Yeah. And I'll bookmark that and I put it in a little folder and every like, I don't know,"
8241960,8249240," six months, check in on it, see how it's going. Literally zero things in that folder have launched."
8250360,8256280," Zero. So happy I didn't back anything. And that reminded me because one thing that I found was like,"
8256280,8260840," it's a little, I know, it's a little bird feeder, but it's an outdoor bird feeder."
8260840,8264760," And it has a camera in it. You know, it's just called an outdoor bird feeder, right?"
8264760,8269400," Like an outdoor bird feeder is just actually no, it's just called a bird feeder."
8269400,8274680," Generally speaking, they go outdoors. There's bird feeders for indoors. You're actually a"
8274680,8281880," crazy bird man. Yes. You know this, right? Yeah. See, Dan agrees. Yeah. I get it. I just,"
8281880,8286120," that's why I said I know before I started this. Fine. But there's this, there was this thing"
8286120,8293880," that it's so it's a bird feeder. For outdoors? Yes. So it's a bird feeder carry on. And it has a"
8293880,8299240," basically a webcam built into it. Yeah. Does it charge life by solar power? Because if it doesn't,"
8299240,8302440," you're never going to charge that. I think it does. I don't remember. I mean, it better. It's been"
8302440,8307720," like years since I bookmarked it. Sure. But it detects when a bird's in front of it and it'll"
8307720,8312920," record a little video for you. Wow. Well, that'll improve your quality of life. Doesn't seem that"
8312920,8321560," complicated. Yeah. It's been years. I had launched it. I don't know. At this point, there's other ones"
8321560,8326120," on the market. I didn't buy those because I was just like, I don't know, I'm kind of over the idea"
8326120,8331640," to be honest. But just out of interest, I'm still like tracking it. I just check in every once in a"
8331640,8336040," while to see how it's going. And yeah, it hasn't launched yet. No shipments yet."
8336040,8342360," Would you like to hear something interesting though? No, don't tell. No. No."
8342360,8348680," I hope this isn't what I think it is. Regarding the coal bar. No."
8348680,8358760," The hammer crowbar combo. We have apparently heard back from them. And Nick has a conversation"
8358760,8371160," scheduled next week. No. He's doing this only to hurt me. I hope, like, I hope people in the audience"
8371160,8376520," understand that that is the only reason. There is no other reason. There's no business. He knows"
8376520,8382760," it's not a good business decision. He 100% knows it's not a good business decision. There's no way"
8382760,8387480," he thinks it's actually like worth the content that's going to come out of it. He just knows it will"
8387480,8395560," hurt me. That is the only goal. This is deep trolling. This is trolling on another level that I don't"
8395560,8400680," know if you guys actually understand. I disagree. I think he thinks it's a great product. No, he does"
8400680,8406200," it. I'd use it. Look at his face. Look at his face. You know, he does that's literally the Linus"
8406200,8412120," troll face. There's a reaction on float plane and I think on Twitch that is literally that face."
8417240,8422200," It sounds just me smiling. It's because I'm smiling. Kyle, come on."
8422200,8428120," Just because I'm smiling doesn't mean I'm trolling. Nice. Kyle's on board. Let's go."
8428120,8434680," How could you do this to me, Kyle? Kyle. Okay. If Kyle has a significant amount of involvement"
8434680,8438520," with the like design process, then maybe it'll actually be good. Kyle and his team,"
8438520,8444120," you know, we have four people on the like tool engineering team now, right? Like we are working"
8444120,8449560," on stuff. I know that because I read through the audit that Dan did for me on everyone who's"
8449560,8461080," changed their passwords in the company. So there's going to be a message sent out to the managers"
8461080,8468520," and executives at Linus Media Group about how that wasn't bleeping done. I see. So we're going to get"
8468520,8474040," a one week extension to next week. Okay. If it's not done by next week, we're going to waste a lot"
8474040,8478760," of time and it's going to be awesome because Dan or I are going to have to sit down with every"
8478760,8483560," single person that didn't update their passwords, which is basically freaking everybody. You know,"
8483560,8488280," I'm just going to be sitting down with like Vance, right, which is going to be a massive waste of time."
8488280,8494040," The reason why I thought about it, Kyle was because your team did it. I did know that and I"
8494040,8498920," appreciate it. And that's why I thought about it. Kyle's team did it and logistics did it. To be fair,"
8498920,8504280," logistics have like four passwords that they had to update. I have a lot of passwords. Yeah."
8504280,8510520," And it can be this is the thing. And this is the reason why I spent the messages specifically"
8510520,8518280," to leaders of teams and technically all the executives twice because you guys need to do your"
8518280,8530120," jobs and delegate. Get it done. Okay. I know you have a lot of passwords. I do."
8530120,8537480," A pram says I did it. Good. Good job. See, look, this is why you need a crowbar. I did my two."
8537480,8546040," This crowbar. Nope. He doesn't need a crowbar. Um, never mind. The coal bar collab is canceled."
8546760,8554440," Yeah. Here's another good topic for us. AMD calls out AMD for bad value GPUs. This is"
8554440,8559720," funny, but I respect it. AMD's own blog recently published a post titled Never a Better Time to"
8559720,8567160," Upgrade with Radeon Graphics. Within it, one graphic compared AMD's GPUs on value for the money"
8567160,8574920," showing FPS per dollar. Their latest flagship GPUs come in at less than half of the FPS per dollar"
8574920,8582040," of AMD's best value GPU, the RX 6400. For reasons unknown, the graphic is arranged with the worst"
8582040,8588040," value GPUs at the top and the best at the bottom. Total FPS is featured more prominently with big"
8588040,8593800," red bars. So I guess they are arranged in order of more FPS. Yeah, it's pretty straightforward."
8593800,8598440," Under that graphic, there's an explanation in small type of how these results were achieved."
8598440,8604360," All cards were tested at max settings except the RX 6400, which was tested at medium settings,"
8604360,8612920," thereby making all the more expensive GPUs look even worse in terms of value because this number"
8612920,8619560," is basically a big pile of ****. Okay, I respected a lot less. I didn't know that part."
8619560,8624280," Discussion question. Should AMD's marketing department just richly just impelled themselves"
8624280,8631880," now or would poison be cleaner? Okay, I respected it at first because I thought they were like"
8631880,8637560," not shying away from things that people in the industry generally know, which is like the maximum"
8637560,8641080," to your card is not going to be the best price performance, but sure, you're going to get the"
8641080,8645400," best FPS and stuff like I thought they were doing a decent educational thing. And then I heard about"
8645400,8653800," how they did it. Yeah. And now maybe poison. Yeah, the 6400 being at medium settings, like I get"
8653800,8661720," it. You don't want to show that it gets like no FPS. 22 FPS. But also no, you don't get to"
8661720,8666840," do that. That's not how benchmarking works. Yeah, it's like super not okay. Yeah. Yeah, that's"
8666840,8673960," ridiculous. That's pretty cool. Oh, wow. We have an LTX 2023 update. Oh, a cool one. Let's go. For"
8673960,8682440," those of you who made it this deep into the show. Thank you. Oh, nice. Yeah. LTX 2023 ticket sales"
8682440,8691800," will go live on Monday, February the 6th at 9am Pacific time. You must create an account on the"
8691800,8698360," store in order to complete your checkout. You can do so in advance by visiting tickets.ltxxpo.com."
8698360,8704120," Tickets are first come first served and they will not be held. So make that account. Now. Now."
8705560,8713160," Or when someone stands over you with a crowbar. I don't need a crowbar. They will go to whoever"
8713160,8718760," completes the checkout the fastest. We do not have any kind of like verified actual gamer thing,"
8718760,8724680," which would have been cool. But I was told that the float plane team is quote busy and quote."
8724680,8734200," Yeah. The VIPs from the canceled 2020 and the whale VIPs from oh whale land VIPs from 2022 have"
8734200,8739240," apparently been sent an email with instructions on how they can access tickets in advance"
8739240,8743960," for a pre-sale event as promised. Oh, cool. So we're making sure that we're taking care of the"
8743960,8749720," folks who won the ticket sales lottery before but didn't ultimately get to go to something. That's"
8749720,8755480," pretty good. That's pretty good. Yeah. That's exciting. Man, I'm excited. LTX is going to be a"
8755480,8762360," blast. We have like so much bigger team. So sweet. Yeah. Like that. It was it was cool."
8762360,8767960," You know, up until the last one, but the last one was a totally different level. The last one"
8767960,8774600," made all the previous ones feel like cringe. Really kind of. Yeah. Yeah. Agreed. And they were"
8774600,8778520," fine for what we were at the time, but they were fine, but I didn't really want to invite anyone"
8778520,8784920," to them. You know what I mean? Like randoms. Yeah. Yeah. Like they were for they were for. I"
8784920,8791560," I'm always hesitant about the word fan because you know, I see a lot of what we do is not fan them,"
8791560,8797800," but like viewership. I want I want to earn it. I don't want fanatical, you know, following or"
8797800,8803000," whatever. I agree. The first ones were fan meetups. Yeah. That's what they were. And that's fine."
8803000,8807800," That has a place. And the last one was like an expo that was actually super sick. I invited."
8807800,8812600," I didn't invite any of my friends to any of the previous ones. Yeah. I invented some"
8812600,8817560," invited some of my friends to that last one. And then to last. Yeah. Yeah. Sometimes I"
8817560,8823640," struggle. Okay. It's okay. Me too. You were a figment of my imagination. It's all long. It's"
8823640,8830680," Fight Club. Your Brad Pitt. You've been soloing the way you never actually brought another person"
8830680,8835480," onto the wind show. Yeah. You've been soloing it the whole time. Yeah. I live in your walls."
8836280,8842840," Yeah. Where's that voice come? But yeah, the last one was great. So if this one is a"
8842840,8847400," continuation or an improvement, then it's going to be fantastic. I'm excited. Well, we've got"
8847400,8853160," Sturf on it and Chase. I think it's going to be great. It's going to be great. Yeah. Yeah."
8853160,8861960," Let's do some merch messages. Yeah. Okay. If I can, I inhaled some water earlier. Thanks for"
8861960,8868360," making me laugh. You're welcome. It was my pleasure. Okay. This one's from Austin. I really do enjoy"
8868360,8876680," your pain though. Yes. That's why I work here. Thank you. This is from Austin. Luke Linus in an"
8876680,8881960," earlier show you said sometimes as you scale up in a business, you have to become less efficient."
8881960,8888200," Can you give some examples of that? Oh, sure. I mean, yeah, the easiest example of that is"
8888200,8896200," I brought in Luke to write scripts, right? So so so now we went from let okay, let's ignore Ed,"
8896200,8899960," who edited videos and Yvonne, who did all the accounting and stuff. So let's go back to the"
8899960,8904360," original four person team, but let's pretend it was only two. Let's pretend it was just me and Luke."
8904360,8911320," If it's me, when I want to write a script, all I do is write the script and that takes, let's say,"
8911320,8919000," four hours. Okay. Now I brought in Luke. We have double the number of hours. So cool. We're going to"
8919000,8925320," get two scripts every four hours, but a script still takes four hours. And when it's done,"
8925320,8932600," now I have to review it, which takes maybe 30 minutes. So my time certainly got more. Yeah,"
8932600,8940040," sometimes longer. So my time certainly got more efficient, but overall, it took more hours to"
8940040,8946360," deliver a finished product. And you basically take that, multiply it times however many levels of"
8946360,8951880," management, add the game of telephone that exists for every different team and individual that's"
8951880,8957800," involved in providing feedback on whatever it is. And you go from, you know, a public communication"
8957800,8964120," from me back in the day being like, bla bla bla bla bla, something on Reddit hit to six, seven,"
8964120,8967880," eight people are involved to make sure that I don't put my foot in my mouth about a warranty or"
8967880,8974920," something like that, right? There's also like team coordination. You can't all be running around"
8974920,8979800," with chickens, like chickens with the head cut off. So you start needing to have meetings and then,"
8979800,8983880," okay, you try to control that. So you start building processes to make it so you don't have"
8983880,8988520," to have that meeting. Okay, but that takes time. And now you have to train people because you're"
8988520,8996520," trying to bring on junior people, but that takes more time. And just every added person, every single"
8996520,9001880," one, every additional person that you bring on reduces efficiency almost across the board by"
9001880,9009400," some amount. It might be really small, but it's some amount. And hopefully that added person adds"
9009400,9014920," more than the efficiency that they take away from the rest of the team. But that equation is"
9014920,9020280," always happening. That's why small teams are good. So small teams get a lot done. Yeah. Yeah."
9020280,9025000," Yeah. Because you have you have less reporting to deal with, you have less extra documentation."
9025000,9028520," Yes, even on a small team, even a team of one, you should be making some amount of documentation."
9028520,9031480," But you can be making more if you're on a big team. Absolutely."
9031480,9035720," Yeah, it's just it is what it is. And it's frustrating, but there's nothing you can do about it."
9035720,9041320," It's just going to be that way. Yeah. And like in theory, Luke's script that he spent four hours"
9041320,9045880," on would be absolutely perfect. And I wouldn't need to review it because he did it as well as me."
9045880,9050360," But no offense, but I'm a much better writer than Luke. And the standards for the channel,"
9050760,9055880," sorry, the standards for the channel aren't going to change. It has to be to my standard."
9055880,9059480," So I have to look at it. And that's going to be a consistent problem if you're in"
9059480,9066760," a field that I will call artisans. Creative. Yeah. Yeah. If you're if you're in a creative"
9066760,9070120," line of work, because you're going to have a way that you like things as well. And there's"
9070120,9074840," pretty much no way that the person that you hire is going to make things exactly in the way that"
9074840,9079640," you like them. Yeah. And also, aside from preference, I am just a better writer than you. Yeah."
9080600,9085320," You didn't hire me as a writer. It's true. I really didn't. I hired him to be a camera operator,"
9085320,9088360," which you're even worse at than writing. That works great."
9088360,9096680," Now, in theory, right, you hire people who are better at things than you."
9096680,9103720," Luke is a much better manager of development than I am. I have no idea where to even start."
9104520,9109720," But then the inefficiency goes the other way, because now Luke has to explain to me what the"
9109720,9115320," crap it is that he does in a weekly float plane digest document that he creates, because otherwise,"
9115320,9119560," I and the rest of the executives have no idea what each other are doing. And in a meeting,"
9119560,9122280," where I'm able to provide any feedback and ask questions."
9122280,9128680," It's inefficient, but I don't see another way to do it. I think it's"
9132040,9137080," inefficient and it is efficient, because it's an efficient solution to a problem,"
9137080,9142760," but it's a problem that's created. Inefficiency. Yeah. This is great. Best line of the"
9142760,9148840," WAN show actually goes to a prime, not to you. Luke wrote a great fantasy of a resume. That's true."
9148840,9156200," It was complete. Don't do this to me, by the way. I've caught people doing this. This is not a"
9156200,9164040," suggestion. But I definitely lied through my teeth on my resume. I had never filmed..."
9164040,9169400," You sure you're not running for office? Anything. That resume would have been really good at it."
9169400,9173960," You guys have a representative? I had never filmed George."
9173960,9179960," If I told you in the first interview, though, I think so. I'm pretty sure. And then you're like,"
9179960,9183320," okay, we'll just film this thing. And the camera that you gave me couldn't even zoom,"
9183320,9191320," so I was like, nice, easy mode. And then I kept kind of cheating, because I got all my friends"
9191320,9196840," to comment bomb the video really positively. I've told you this part too. Yeah. I don't know."
9196840,9201640," It just makes me cringe every time. Let's go. Get it done. Don't do that."
9201640,9208360," Don't do that to me. I did it, so I'll be able to catch it. Yeah. It's like a classic,"
9208360,9216760," never know a bullshat or like its man what did someone try to see I'm not I'm not gonna name names"
9216760,9225040," but there's a number of kind of prominent personalities among I would say men in my peer group over"
9225040,9233140," the last I don't know five to ten years that have turned out to be total butt heads and basically one"
9233140,9242020," after the other I've kind of gone uh-huh yeah and because there's this playbook right where they will"
9242020,9251340," they will they will they will start with unassailable fact in in any given you know talk or any given"
9251340,9257460," video or lecture or whatever else it is they will start with unassailable fact and perfect logical"
9257460,9263460," connections between their points and go ending conclusion a thing that isn't actually quite fact"
9263460,9270660," and people who are not listening critically and analyzing what's being said will assume that because"
9270660,9276540," every linkage they've seen up until now was flawless the last one must just be something that they"
9276540,9283260," don't fully understand and as someone who didn't spend a lot of time or pay a lot of attention in"
9283260,9294820," that class but fundamentally understands what they were trying to explain it basically it basically"
9294820,9303140," seems to stem from an inability for most people to follow along with like a philosophical argument"
9303140,9310780," philosophy is basically math but for words so you you have to theoretically like if you are doing"
9310780,9320460," it well you have to prove your point go full q ed but you use words instead of numbers and so"
9320460,9325980," when done when done really well what you do is essentially create a bulletproof argument you"
9325980,9332860," you create proof for the point that you are trying to make now obviously many philosophical"
9332860,9339460," arguments cannot be yeah fully proven yeah and so you create a lot of um you create a lot of"
9339460,9346020," opening or yeah you create a lot of opening for bad philosophy yes but done well it's supposed to"
9346020,9351700," be unassailable it's supposed to be proven and so as someone who is at least familiar with that"
9351700,9359220," concept I I look at the way I look at I look at it and I go they know what they're doing right"
9359220,9364700," because I understand their craft well enough to recognize it done well and then now that I know"
9364700,9369500," what they're doing when I see it not done well I go oh then they're probably doing that on purpose"
9369500,9375220," too these are bad people um and it's it's been it's been kind of hard for me to watch to be"
9375220,9387860," perfectly on this video I don't blame you next up okay we're in the oh god we're in the same sort"
9387860,9392620," of vein on this this is from anonymous on average how many hours a week do you guys work and how does"
9392620,9404660," it compare to the average hours of the rest of your staff too many and I hope more than I have"
9404660,9410660," better balance these days but the lines between work and not work for me are extraordinarily blurry"
9410660,9415940," theoretically I take every Monday off but I think all right you know for a fact that I do"
9415940,9425140," plenty of work on Mondays and look and it's often not even subtle like he's like filming at his"
9425140,9431780," house of the film crew he's just not at work he's at home filming with the film crew yeah I mean"
9431780,9437820," that doesn't we try not to do that anymore than we absolutely have to like I am setting aside time"
9437820,9441820," like I'm scheduling time for things that yeah but you also try not to like stay after Wanchow and"
9441820,9447540," film videos yeah more than you absolutely have to or push Wanchow back because of filming videos"
9447540,9452660," more than you absolutely have to but that happens every single week well okay but the point is that"
9452660,9460380," yeah and so okay a lot of what I do is also I don't know if it's work or not but I like it"
9460380,9467060," never really turns off so like on a Saturday I'm sitting checking analytics and reading comments on"
9467060,9473780," the video that released that day like I never I shouldn't say never but almost never like maybe"
9473780,9479500," one out of a hundred I don't check community sentiment when we release a video so I'm working"
9479500,9487020," every single day from that point of view but it's not like work work it's like I mean I was"
9487020,9491660," gonna say it's time I wouldn't have spent doing anything else anyway but that's probably because"
9491660,9495980," it's so ingrained in me that if I have a moment of downtime I should be looking at channel analytics"
9495980,9500580," and read comments so I don't know am I addicted is it work I'm not sure somewhere in between"
9500580,9506420," probably I think pretty you ask pretty much any like social media personality and they probably"
9506420,9511700," are wired pretty much the same way because I don't think you'd survive otherwise yeah I've had a lot"
9511700,9517300," of team expansion over the last little while so there's been a lot of stuff to do and like it's"
9517300,9523140," it's fine I'm not complaining about it I don't even think I've mentioned it to line as much no key"
9523140,9527180," eleven nineteen nine this is work revolves around YouTube so technically him recording in his house"
9527180,9535380," is still work they're not it's not technically it is work yeah that's that's my point my point is"
9535380,9540580," that it's no different it's just at home no no that just is work that's not that's not technically"
9540580,9551220," anything there's no gray area there but yeah I don't know okay I know I do know some people on my"
9551220,9556740," staff work more than they should though I've had more than a few conversations telling people to"
9556740,9561780," stop crunching yeah and I never told them to crunch in the first place yeah they're just like"
9561780,9568260," passionate people that care a lot which is cool yeah but yeah my favorite is yelling at people to"
9568260,9573300," fill up their time cheese properly like well actually cannot work for no pay mines fill out right"
9573300,9577660," now yeah you you actually I shouldn't have to fill one out I still I will die on that hill that's"
9577660,9583580," ridiculous absolutely ridiculous makes no sense in his complete BS I work way more than that many"
9583580,9596300," hours so like hold on a second yeah hold on what is he doing no I just I thought I thought I"
9596300,9603260," fuck fuck to give about it that I had in here but it's just if I have to fill a time sheet no"
9603260,9607420," you should have to fill it a time sheet that's what I'm saying I do fill it a time sheet why I"
9607420,9615500," just delegate it"
9615500,9627100," all right fair enough I'll take that I'll take that"
9627100,9642780," wow all right that's a that's a next level move you have much to learn to learn from Linus"
9642780,9656700," you you can't do that oh my goodness wow okay moving on okay this one's from brian Linus I didn't"
9656700,9663660," realize that you were Star Wars expanded universe fan it's typing in one number a day it is ridiculous"
9663660,9670220," oh my god are you going to get it it is crazy I used to be salary and I had to fill in a time sheet"
9670220,9674780," it literally doesn't make any sense okay yeah agreed that part's also like actually it's actually"
9674780,9680460," wrong how we do it just not allowed overtime why are we doing this just pay me a for Adam but it's"
9680460,9687500," you book market you said an alarm it takes less than 30 seconds I still did it every day I'm not"
9687500,9694060," I'm not I still don't think he should do it but the fact that it's delegated is great why don't you"
9694060,9698380," just fill it in the same for like the next six months and then if anything changes because they're"
9698380,9704460," gonna see it ahead of time they'll know that you did that what's wrong with that it's not today oh man"
9704460,9712780," so look the current system is designed to ensure that everyone gets paid fairly for their time"
9712780,9719180," I don't think that's how salary works like legitimately I don't know how your stuff works I know how"
9719180,9723820," like everyone who's hourly I know how everyone hourly works yeah yeah I really should have to fill"
9723820,9727900," the time sheet and I don't I don't know I don't know what the deal is and I honestly I haven't"
9727900,9731340," really looked it up so I could be wrong I have no idea but I'm pretty sure salary we have an"
9731340,9736380," actual HR person now so I'm pretty sure we've like looked it up it's honestly it would take more"
9736380,9739820," time to have the discussion with them about it yeah it would be for me to fill up the sheet which"
9739820,9746620," is why I haven't done it yet so deal with it yeah it's just still ridiculous apparently they check"
9746620,9751260," once a week to make sure that you are a keeping up and be not filling it out ahead yeah that's"
9751260,9756140," awesome yeah that's why you can't flow it ahead I knew that bit but like it created enormous problems"
9756140,9760300," when people were filling them out ahead or when they were falling behind because then accounting"
9760300,9763660," has to waste a whole bunch of time having stupid conversations they don't have to have like hey"
9763660,9768460," no you actually weren't there that day can you please go fix that like no no no no no no no no"
9768460,9772220," they have better things to do with their lives than chase down people's inability to track their"
9772220,9776300," own schedules they actually have a lot to do we actually have a very complicated accounting"
9776300,9781660," situation because of floodplain and creator warehouse and receiving all of our not all of our money"
9781660,9786860," but a lot of our money for different things from foreign currencies and like it's a very complicated"
9786860,9796060," job for an organization our size our accounting is ridiculous like we've gone to not small accounting"
9796060,9800940," firms and gone hey can we just can we just offload this to you they've been like"
9800940,9813020," no for real and it's like fair yeah I don't even I didn't blame them like the the fact that we have"
9813020,9820060," Yvonne to to to help create systems and to build our accounting department and to basically learn"
9820060,9829100," from scratch how to how to how to CFO like a a very complicated company is a miracle someone"

9833820,9840060," marry her for her math skills though it is why I started dating her is it I don't think I knew"
9840060,9845500," that well it was kind of how it wasn't how we met but it was how we like you know got close"
9845500,9850460," was she was tutoring me in math okay I did know that so she like totally accidentally was"
9850460,9854060," spending a lot of time with me even though she knew I had a girlfriend so I always joke about how"
9854060,9860620," she stole me which she hates like if you want to bother Yvonne at ltx ask her to tell the story"
9860620,9865580," of how she stole me don't warn her about it don't like don't like blow her up right now"

9881020,9886300," right now it's hilarious you're setting her up to not enjoy ltx though no no she'll enjoy it"
9886300,9892540," she'll enjoy it i'll enjoy it however much she enjoys it i know you'll enjoy it more oh my goodness"
9892540,9898700," that is not always worth it oh it'll be worth it trust me what you should do is not ask her that"
9898700,9904460," but just tell her that Linus said that no that's not gonna be as much fun there it'll be funnier"
9904460,9915420," the other way trust me okay moving on sorry I derailed that sorry keep going oh geez this one's"
9915420,9921020," from brian Linus so i didn't realize you were a star wars extended universe expanded yeah you've"
9921020,9926380," read this already didn't you yeah i tried to that i immediately pull us back it's my fault i think"
9926380,9932940," you mean was a star wars um oh expanded universe fan or extended or whatever it is um last week you"
9932940,9938940," referenced jina and zek do you have a favorite book slash character slash moment from the expanded"
9938940,9947260," universe well none of its canon so that's cool instead we have just like absolute dog crap for canon"
9947820,9953900," um i would i would honestly if they put me in charge of luke's film tomorrow the first thing i"
9953900,9961180," would do is i would go dc cinematic universe on the whole thing and i'd be like okay this this this"
9961180,9968780," this and this all garbage we throw it all away now we're starting fresh like there is so much"
9968780,9976140," trash that makes absolutely no sense in the star wars canon now that you can't even build a uh you"
9976140,9982700," can't even build a universe around it that makes any sense anymore and it's it's junk and it should"
9982700,9988700," be gone um as for my favorites i mean yeah i was about that age when the young jennonite series came"
9988700,9993100," out that that that was you know pretty enjoyable for me like it wasn't challenging reading but i"
9993100,10001500," did love the stories love the characters um i'd say probably the the first uh grand admiral throw on"
10001500,10008140," did he start a vice admiral i don't know it doesn't really matter yeah it is yeah the the first thron"
10008140,10015740," saga timothy zon hopefully i'm pronouncing that right zon zon too too good to be writing like"
10015740,10020540," crappy throw away star wars fiction yeah because i was gonna say most my favorite books i'm just"
10020540,10027180," going through like a list right now are written by him um a lot of them are the thron ones yeah"
10030700,10038140," but yeah thron trilogy air to the empire dark first rising the last command so good um you can"
10038140,10044700," i think anyone can write a dumb character but not anyone can write a smart character something"
10044700,10050540," that i found interesting uh i shouldn't say that writing a dumb character well is also a very"
10050540,10057420," talent skill thing i dropped the gp a very talent skill yeah this is the guy that's better at writing"
10057420,10062140," scripts than i am uh writing not speaking them actually i'm better at speaking than you two that's true"
10062140,10069900," oh sorry sorry i was spicy today you speak about the whole thing things how many times if you dropped"
10069900,10078700," that was it like three or four right there just there oh you happy that did not hit you yeah we can"
10078700,10084700," pretend this one might oh god i think it actually did and there's a monitor in front of them and"
10084700,10088380," it's skimmed right over it's okay minus line of zones the monitor that's pretty pro"
10088380,10096060," i should put on his camera on your time sheet at at line is beat me as a comment um it's very"
10096060,10101740," soft though i can get rid of all dt something that i found pretty interesting was i did the audiobooks"
10101740,10108300," but listening to the audiobooks for the prequel series prequel series yeah like for the prequel"
10108300,10112860," movies yeah oh there's audiobooks there's books for them that makes sense and they're like way better"
10114060,10119020," right they probably explain a bunch of stuff yeah just like it gets hand waved away i was like"
10119020,10126860," way more interested in it you will find this plot coherent there was a bunch of scenes where they"
10126860,10134620," explained like what characters were thinking in the moment right um like the scene where uh palpatine"
10134620,10141100," there's a few different scenes in palpatine's like throne room thing his office whatever um"
10141820,10148540," there's one of them where and and i watched the film to check this part and it's in it"
10148540,10153340," but it's so subtle no one's ever gonna pick it up he like moves his hand slightly"
10153340,10158060," and in the i don't know if this was like they added this afterwards so it wasn't actually planned"
10158060,10163260," for because it's so subtle but it's like he thought about pulling his lightsaber out and that's where"
10163260,10167740," it was hidden but he like decided not or it was in his chair something i don't remember it's been"
10167740,10172780," it's been years since i did it but the audiobooks were actually like way more interesting got it there's"
10172780,10176860," a lot of like little subtle things going on which there's a lot of subtle stuff in the prequels because"
10176860,10181900," it's like a political series more than anything yeah um so there's a ton of subtle stuff that they add"
10181900,10188060," in um i didn't give the prequels enough credit when they came out and part of it is their own fault"
10188060,10196620," because yeah jar jar banks is actually just unindefensibly terrible um and annoying and like the"
10196620,10201420," darth jar jar plot was real it'd be so much more interesting the slapstick you know r2d2 has a"
10201420,10206620," jetpack now just like utterly unnecessary canon breaking moments that just destroyed the immersion"
10206620,10214620," for me we're still objectively awful uh but the actual like political story behind it was so much"
10214620,10222540," more coherent than i mean anything before or since yeah honestly yeah yep at least in the movies"
10225820,10232540," thrown yeah thrown yeah and i loved how he was like um like an alien in the like like the racist"
10232540,10236540," empire and like talking about that experience and everything yeah just super really good books"
10236540,10245100," okay uh i've got one here from an anonymous with new react channel would you consider doing a"
10245100,10250780," proper reaction to the verge's infamous pc build video as a sort of retrospective it's actually"
10250780,10257260," the video and its reception that started my own pc building journey probably not what if you did it"
10257260,10264060," to your video of building something here with him um well then i i mean i feel like okay again"
10264060,10269820," this comes back to my my whole thing where why we're making this video is the question that we"
10269820,10274060," ask right when we start every video project why are we why are we bothering what are we adding to"
10274060,10281900," the conversation and for the original verge video i mean there were multiple people internally that"
10281900,10286700," at the time we're like hey we should do a reaction to this and i looked at it and went no i think"
10286700,10291100," everything that needs to be said has been said what are we actually adding a million times to"
10291100,10295980," yep adding to the conversation nothing let's uh stay the course let's do our own thing and"
10295980,10301580," ultimately that's what we did and by biting our time i think we ultimately did the best response"
10301580,10307260," to that video which was to bring stephan onto our show and uh with him show you guys how to build a"
10307260,10315900," pc properly i think that was that was the the me way to react to that um the me way yeah yeah"
10315900,10319580," that's the reason i wouldn't do it because i don't think i'd be adding anything to the conversation"
10319580,10327660," makes sense okay this one's from zakari hey lynus and luke and dan i love the new plushie i went to"
10327660,10334220," walmart today and saw an rgb power strip of all things what is the most egregious addition of rgb"
10334220,10341260," to a product you've ever seen i haven't seen it yet but we're hoping that um ludwig will customize"
10341260,10347420," the swipe plus to add rgb to the bidet and then you'll carry it we're hoping that we'll get the"
10347420,10352220," rgb version if not i mean the other one's good too but i would like it to be rgb for gamers"
10355660,10360540," just have like activity detection yeah are you gonna have an rgb thing i have a"
10360540,10367180," video no i know but they did oh oh oh does it have rgb in it though i don't know i don't think so"
10367180,10372780," as long as you can turn it off i never really care yeah okay fair enough um you call yourself a gamer"
10372780,10377100," this one's from beraton yeah i'm like definitely not aesthetically"
10377100,10383740," having almost broken both of my wrists this morning by slipping and catching myself with my"
10383740,10388700," hands it made me curious if any of you have broken any bones uh tell me the story"
10388700,10398060," is it a no it's a no all right i have not broken a bone but i have fractured one that's a break uh"
10398060,10404300," yeah um that's just when i was when i was i'm sorry i haven't broken my screen but i have fractured"
10404300,10409180," every time i say i broke it and then i talk about it more and bring up that it was a fracture people"
10409180,10416300," like you didn't break it and i'm like whatever it's just it's just it's a whatever degree"
10416300,10423260," whatever yeah i don't know it's they're all broken yeah that's stupid yeah whatever anyway um but"
10423260,10430780," when i was younger i i grew really fast i was basically this tall in like i think it was grade six"
10430780,10436620," and my bones were like real thin that makes sense i was taking some big old pills for it and all"
10436620,10442540," this other kind of stuff because i was like fragile and we were snowboarding and i"
10442540,10449260," crouched and then went to like sit back and put my hand back and everyone just heard it like"
10449260,10458300," yeah that it didn't even hurt that bad but i was like that's probably bad and we went down"
10458300,10463660," because like i was fine i could still snowboard so i just got up and snowboarded down which the"
10463660,10469180," guy was mad at me about but i went to the like medical place we're at Cyprus the mountain uh"
10469180,10474620," we went to the medical place and he put a thing on it and let me go and was like don't snowboard"
10474620,10479340," anymore and i immediately went back and kept snowboarding because that's obviously what i would do"
10479340,10485180," and it was fine every time i would fall i would just you know not fall on that"
10485180,10492620," and that was it took a little while to recover and then i was fine i haven't broken anything since"
10493420,10495420," it was a"
10495420,10501660," you're an idiot sometimes it was fine i know i know but you're an idiot sometimes"
10501660,10507260," because i can't i can't like i can't you probably would have done something similar no i wouldn't"
10507260,10512060," have i could see it happening i well i wouldn't have checked to see if it was broken so i wouldn't"
10512060,10517180," have known there you go this is really funny um my sister the one that did the build uh is that"
10517180,10521100," better i don't think that's better she broke that's worse she broke her arm as a child at least"
10521100,10526460," mine was in a and when they did the x-ray they found i think it was two other breaks on the same arm"
10526460,10532380," that she just hadn't noticed i guess and just kept like playing or doing whatever what she's"
10532380,10536460," doing and they just healed like like they were like what what the green stick fracture or whatever"
10536460,10541020," like hairline fractures or whatever like so the the one that she went in and got x-rayed actually"
10541020,10546860," had other breaks in it that had already healed um i do have a story about how i've never broken a"
10546860,10552940," bono because i've fallen off of plenty of horses i did martial arts for years um i've done my fair"
10552940,10558540," share of of dangerous sports be it skiing snowboarding um i don't think there's anything else i've done"
10558540,10564700," that's particularly dangerous um i don't know just stuff a lot of horseback riding like i've"
10564700,10570780," fallen off of horses at height i've been bucked and stuff like that um but one of the one of the keys"
10570780,10577420," is knowing how to fall properly uh if there's any if there's one reason that my kids uh do martial"
10577420,10583980," arts training it is to learn how to fall because the difference between falling like this and falling"
10583980,10589580," like this is this hurts a lot and this breaks your wrist"
10589580,10598780," fall on the meat and and spread out the force yeah like you fall like this turn your face to the"
10598780,10603580," side don't go face in first you know all that all that kind of stuff hit the ground make sure you"
10603580,10608300," exhale when you hit the ground otherwise you're gonna get winded all those little things yeah i"
10608300,10616380," played a lot of like pretty brutal sports and did a lot of uh to put it your way fairly idiotic"
10616380,10620780," things throughout my years and i never broke anything else after that because i was usually"
10620780,10625660," pretty good at falling just that time like it shouldn't have happened my bones are just thin as"
10625660,10631260," heck so i just like it went i don't know i didn't really do anything wrong i like crouched and then"
10631260,10636700," leaned into the snow it should like not be a bad situation but it just i don't know it just was"
10636700,10643260," wow horses not popular uh in float plane chat tilt lord says my sister's horse kicked her in the"
10643260,10648780," face and messed up her teeth uh mike reed goes horses are jerks though to this day my sternum pops"
10648780,10652540," when i stretch because of an encounter with a particularly kicky horse my dad had when i was a"
10652540,10657900," kid yeah i got kicked in the head once fortunately it was by a full um i mean she wasn't just born"
10657900,10665180," but she wasn't full grown because otherwise might not be here then it was one of only"
10665180,10674060," three times in my life that i have blacked out um but it was for such a shorty brutal it was for"
10674060,10679260," such a short period she got me like right behind the ear that's bad back of it is bad three inches"
10679260,10684220," higher and to the side and she would have had me in the temple yeah a little lower and she would"
10684220,10690460," have had me right in the stem of my neck uh so it was like it was like right here um she probably"
10690460,10697100," wishes she got me there because boy was i ever mad at her i i was out for however long it took"
10697100,10705420," my head to go from my standing height to about here so i didn't actually fall down like i was"
10705420,10714540," conscious to catch myself um and there's uh so there's a there's a process for getting horses to"
10714540,10719180," submit i forget what it's called anymore but basically you like separate them from the herd"
10719180,10721740," um and so"
10721740,10729820," that's what i had been trying to do and she had because because it's it's to it's to help train"
10729820,10735260," them um and so that's what i had been trying to do and she like got past me and i like tried to go"
10735260,10744140," for her and she like just like went wild and and got me and man i was like determined i was like"
10744140,10750860," no you will your head will go like this and you will be calm and i'm not leaving this riding ring"
10750860,10758060," until that is done like so mad i mean you never never you never hit them like you never actually"
10758060,10763900," behave aggressively toward a horse because that's not how you build a relationship with them but"
10763900,10769020," this this process is actually something that they do do in the wild uh where they'll they'll separate"
10769020,10773260," one from the herd to discipline it is not called breaking a horse well no breaking is wild breaking"
10773260,10777180," is yeah it's a it's kind of a different thing okay i don't forget exactly what it's called i don't"
10777180,10783260," know that was stuff man i was mad i grew up with a bunch of horse people but i it's no offense to"
10783260,10787420," any horse people listening i just never really cared i think it's part of breaking them or something"
10787420,10794060," but like yeah so it's a whole thing i have no idea it's a whole thing moving on okay this one's from"
10794060,10799420," ryan have you seen the Ferrara systems silicone based active cooling tech if their claims about"
10799420,10805580," scalability with better nodes works out seems to have an interesting implications for future tech"
10805580,10810220," yeah we're in touch um if they have an actual demo we can actually show you guys then we we want"
10810220,10814460," to do a video about it for sure makes sense yeah it would be yeah that would be pretty awesome"
10814460,10821180," there uh this one's from alex with a daughter on the way i have been thinking about how much my"
10821180,10827020," dad impacted me i now work in it and i think back to when he let me play halo as long as i didn't"
10827020,10832940," tell mom do you have a moment in your life that started your love for tech i hope to inspire my"
10832940,10838780," daughter to dream big too i think gaming yeah like i still remember playing tie fight or like"
10838780,10843820," wanting to game and not being able to unless i figured out how to use the computer that was"
10843820,10848860," that was i think that's the root of a lot of tech people from our generation yeah for me i there was"
10848860,10853500," a buddy that i would carpool with to school and he would be dropped off at our house and then we"
10853500,10857020," would drive from our house but he would be there for like half an hour before we left and he was my"
10857020,10863740," best friend so we would want to play diablo but the only way that we could play like it wouldn't"
10863740,10868620," detect the other computer on land right so we had to figure out like how ip stuff worked so we"
10868620,10874060," could play together uh and my dad my dad was fairly competent so he was able to kind of lead us to"
10874060,10879260," water but he wanted us to learn so he didn't just tell us exactly how to do it but he like"
10879260,10884700," guided us along the path to figuring it out and then we have would have to do it fairly often and"
10884700,10888780," then my dad gave me a computer that was like broken that i was able to tear apart and i like"
10888780,10894940," broke it way more nice and then nice felt really bad whereas usually in the rest of my life i'm"
10894940,10898380," just like i just mess with something and who cares like it doesn't really matter but i was like no"
10898380,10902780," i actually wanted this thing to work yeah so from there i'm like okay i should probably do better now"
10902780,10906940," i want to figure out how to do this better yeah exactly that was that was a lot of the drive"
10906940,10916540," okay this one's from daniel when nintendo decides to make their next console would you like to see"
10916540,10922380," a similar form of the switch a move back to a fixed console station or something new"
10922460,10932540," okay i have an opinion here i'll go first i guess uh fixed console station and i know that might be"
10932540,10939740," really yeah or more of a focus on it maybe maybe if the doc enables more power which was something"
10939740,10943980," that i think a lot of us were hoping when before the switch came out i gave that an eGPU in it or"
10943980,10951580," something like that because 60 fps dock we were hanging out fairly recently and you busted out the"
10951580,10956460," Wii U and that was really fun that's totally fun we didn't even play Wii U games we played Wii"
10956460,10963500," games yeah it was great play some Wii sports let's go co-op is like a dead meme at this point yeah"
10963500,10973260," like it's so hard to find co-op games um and i think if there was more focus on the fixed console"
10973260,10979580," experience more games would be made for it you know but i think a lot of switch games are made"
10980700,10986460," with the switch being mobile more in mind and when it's mobile it's usually single player yes"
10986460,10991740," there's some nintendo titles that are like okay one player gets one controller and you can play"
10991740,10996460," with the little switch propped up with the little leg thingy that breaks way too easily but i don't"
10996460,11002940," think there's that many that are made for that i'm gonna have a bit of a um maybe controversial"
11002940,11012940," take here um i trust nintendo to innovate and do something different as much as i trust them to be"
11012940,11017580," generally anti-consumer and money-grabbing so yep they're gonna want to change the"
11017580,11022460," controller so you have to buy new ones etc yeah i'm gonna go with um nintendo knows what's best for"
11022460,11028140," for innovation in gaming and doing something different than what sony and microsoft are doing"
11028140,11034540," and if they decide that uh you know a switch is uh you know the best they can do right now then i'm"
11034540,11042300," into it if they think it should have four screens or like uh you know a waggly dildo for a controller"
11042300,11048060," then i guess i'm into that too let's uh let's go we already made the week yeah i know that was"
11048060,11052060," the joke yeah thanks danny i think so sorry i'm sorry i'm not gonna be expecting you welcome to the"
11052060,11058860," party um it is a little wild to me that the switch was released in 2017 and we still don't have a new one"
11058860,11069820," i don't count the OLED but yeah anyways moon on okay this one's from charles hey lienus uh just"
11069820,11074380," fixed a really annoying issue with my pc which wouldn't let it boot pass the bias what was the"
11074380,11082060," hardest tech issue you've encountered and how did you fix it hmm i have no idea"
11082060,11089980," hardest tech issue you've encountered oh man the one i had to solve for the"
11089980,11096380," amd challenge actually was pretty difficult and i think that you know 10 years ago or whatever i"
11096380,11103340," probably wouldn't have been able to see um i don't know Nvidia's whole 680i platforms like super"
11103340,11111740," flaky um hardest tech issue i survived on that that wasn't it 780i i think yeah yeah it was just"
11111740,11117980," as bad survived on there for a while yeah um stuff times hardest tech issue i don't know i thought"
11117980,11122780," so like the whole life was just tech issues yeah this is a hard question because you'd have to drill"
11122780,11130060," through practically half the waking hours of every day for the last 25 years the stability of the"
11130060,11136700," wandshow stream yeah that's the one that probably plagued me longest i mean we we would reinstall"
11136700,11141580," windows swap out literally every piece of hardware and it would crash anyway and we could both go"
11141580,11146620," home and stream stably yeah but we couldn't couldn't stream with the way in pc we both tried it was"
11146620,11152860," just lienus i tried to fix it too yeah i've tried now yeah i think this is my second the wands pc is"
11152860,11159900," cursed yep i am i'm going to always be cursed no all right i'll bring a priest in sounds good"
11159900,11166460," you need some holy water then i'll break it too um but yeah yeah don't have a great answer"
11166460,11173180," okay last one i've got here is from anonymous hey luke i was just wondering if me making a"
11173180,11179260," float plane resolution upscaling ai tool would be against the terms of service or any other rules"
11179260,11186300," and yes i'm one of the i can see the need for four fourteen forty p cringe take"
11186300,11198380," um just run it in 4k my dude um it's just bit right man come on i don't think it is i don't care"
11198380,11208700," legal legal teas and seas are hard i don't think it is i'm not personally mad about it i think it's"
11208700,11214540," unnecessary i a lot of the ai resolution upscaling stuff that i've seen in the past is not good"
11214540,11221820," but i mean i mean yeah if you're just if you're just downloading the video and then watching it"
11221820,11226380," upscaled like you're not even really doing anything you could just use existing tools like right oh"
11226380,11231260," yeah just do that you just do that yeah yeah i mean you can't you like auto download the videos"
11231260,11235180," anyway and then you could just like you'd have to sort of make that you point an upscaling"
11235180,11241260," tool at a folder at the folder and then just have it out somewhere like this gotta be what you do"
11241260,11245420," like if you're capable of doing this you're definitely capable of doing it a smarter way yeah"
11245420,11253180," yeah yeah wait waste your time because you could have just downloaded or watched the 4k version"
11253180,11264220," all right two more last two um luke as your team grows will you add product managers yep and"
11264220,11274060," how do you calculate roi from a product side there are many things that this guy gets me to make that"
11274060,11282220," i tell him enthusiastically before making it that the roi makes no sense so sometimes i don't"
11282220,11286060," calculate it because there's no point because i tell him it's terrible and he's like we're doing"
11286060,11290540," it anyways and i'm like gotcha but we're privately held companies so we can just do cool stuff that"
11290540,11294220," doesn't make any sense to be completely honest yeah i'm not mad about it there's just a lot of"
11294220,11301180," things that we make that aren't really roi focused so if he's like i don't care then cool i don't"
11301180,11307660," care either but if it matters then it matters i don't know it uh will you add product managers yes i"
11307660,11318300," have to um dan from the uh lab's website side is doing that very well um it's it's going great"
11318300,11324140," a.j has been taking on more leadership responsibility recently he's been doing a fantastic job of it"
11324140,11330620," and then there's actually going to be some more news in that regard relatively soon but yeah it's"
11330620,11337100," happening not for everything right um but when the team working on that thing is getting relatively"
11337100,11343500," big and there's a bunch of teams it makes sense for that relatively big team to have someone uh"
11344060,11350620," leading it kind of with me um because doing it all myself is going to be problematic but yeah"
11350620,11360220," and finally uh where did it go ah Benjamin asks how much of the ltt channel views happens on"
11360220,11368220," videos older than a month six months five years it ebbs and flows sometimes a lot of the viewership"
11368220,11376460," is just coming from whatever's fresh and whatever we can do to to generate um as as good as possible"
11376460,11382540," as good a push as possible on that new content and then it just falls off a cliff and then six"
11382540,11388780," months later the rules totally change and that content that just kind of went and then died right"
11388780,11394940," out of the gate is back with a vengeance um i actually messaged uh my contact recently saying"
11394940,11403020," like hey i'm not complaining but i i do always get unnerved by what i perceive as big swings in"
11403020,11408460," algorithmic behavior and this last month has been a doozy uh we're on an upswing for our back catalog"
11408460,11416220," that i haven't seen the likes of in probably a couple of years and uh it's following a downswing"
11416220,11421100," the likes of which i had only seen a few times in the last five years and i'm just kind of sitting"
11421100,11425260," here going guys you're sending me very mixed messages here i mean they're not you know you ask someone"
11425260,11431100," like okay so Todd had a search and discovery and he'll always tell you okay make evergreen content"
11431100,11435740," just focus on quality focus on viewer satisfaction it's like yeah i always do that but in terms of"
11435740,11440140," the actual day-to-day performance of the videos they send doesn't always reflect that way far less"
11440140,11447340," consistent messages and so yeah it's it's all over the place not gonna lie um but what i can say is it"
11447340,11452460," also depends on your content strategy right like we try to make sure that every video has what i"
11452460,11457580," call learning outcomes so that even if you watch it five years down the line and the actual parts"
11457580,11461500," that we're talking about are completely obsolete and irrelevant there'll still be something that"
11461500,11466300," you can learn from it so that'll help that'll make it more likely that people will come across it"
11466300,11471980," and more likely that it'll be recommended because it's more likely that people will be satisfied by that"
11471980,11480540," particular video this is great anonymous okay i find one last one one last one i got your screw"
11480540,11484700," driver the day after you announced it two of my friends that it was overpriced both of them have"
11484700,11492460," ordered one since nice and with that i will see you again next week same bad time same bad channel"
11493420,11494680," Bye!"
11494680,11516180," [Music]"
