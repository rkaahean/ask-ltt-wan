0,4400," What is up?"
4400,5400," How are y'all doing?"
5400,8520," It's Friday and welcome to the WAN Show."
8520,11480," We've got a great show lined up for you guys today."
11480,17560," We're going to be talking about the cease and desist that Lenovo issued to framework,"
17560,22560," the laptop company that I invested in over their power button."
22560,28960," We will also be talking about the potential upcoming branding for LTT Labs, spoiler alert."
28960,32680," It is not going to be LTT Labs."
32680,34840," Otherwise, I just spoiled it."
34840,37280," So, alert, I have not spoiled it."
37280,38280," Yeah."
38280,39280," Yeah, that's good."
39280,44560," John Deere Tractor used to run Doom because we are slowly reducing the amount of things"
44560,46080," in the world that can't run Doom."
46080,48920," No, it's a bigger story than that, Luke, but we'll talk about the leader."
48920,51480," No, it is actually very cool."
51480,53120," Also, trust me, bro."
53120,54120," Oh, no."
54120,55920," You're really making that a headline topic."
55920,58960," I was going to try and slip it in somewhere with people."
58960,61160," The screwdriver pop up."
61160,64760," Okay, sure."
64760,67040," Sweaters!"
67040,68960," The metaverse is awful."
68960,69960," Show harder, Luke."
69960,84680," Show harder."
84680,90560," The show is brought to you today by Squarespace, Exploit and Secret Lab."
90560,92680," And no, it's not Secret Lab."
92680,93920," They make chairs."
93920,95560," Our lab will be a different lab."
95560,97560," Let's jump right into our first topic."
97560,100360," I admit, I debated you guys a little bit."
100360,102920," I actually agree with Lenovo."
102920,104920," This was a thing that-"
104920,105920," Did we get you so you didn't?"
105920,106920," Had to happen."
106920,107920," Oh, okay."
107920,108920," I guess I didn't."
108920,113160," But the implication might be that I'm like mad about it, but there's nothing to really"
113160,114520," be mad about."
114520,115640," It looks pretty innocent."
115640,117880," It doesn't look like it was something they planned to do."
117880,122520," It looks like a very reasonable design if you're making a plastic thing that needs to"
122520,125240," continue working and also needs to be moved."
125240,126240," Yep."
126240,132200," Obviously, it's not their logo because you can't 3D print their logo without the centerpiece"
132200,133400," falling through."
133400,134400," Yeah."
134400,140200," But the reason that Lenovo came after them, framework tweeted about it, is that the resemblance"
140200,149040," of frameworks power button on their first party 3D printed case to the Lenovo O Legion"
149040,152800," design is unmistakable."
152800,157120," That's what we call in the biz and oops, my bad."
157120,158120," Yeah."
158120,159360," And they're already working on it."
159360,165200," They asked for community contests, which is a cool idea where people can submit designs"
165200,172480," and whoever can come up with the best design is going to get a free I51135G7 mainboard,"
172480,173720," which is cool."
173720,181200," It was noted by a former member mid core that Lenovo's gaming, the O Legion gaming logo"
181200,183400," used to actually look like this."
183400,185600," But that's the one I kind of remember."
185600,188760," It bore a lot of resemblance to the Mercedes Benz logo."
188760,194720," So as it turns out, there's just not a whole lot more ways that you can."
194720,198600," Put some things through or on a circle."
198600,200400," Actually, oh, I'm wearing it right now."
200400,206280," I happen to be wearing our case shirt design that has been pointed out to me looks an awful"
206280,208160," lot like the Renault logo."
208160,209160," Oh, yeah."
209160,210160," Renault cars."
210160,211160," You know what?"
211160,212160," Yeah."
212160,213160," Not intentional."
213160,214760," No association whatsoever."
214760,217560," It just happens to be a what is it?"
217560,221280," Isometric view of a box."
221280,223280," It's a computer case."
223280,227160," It wasn't the intention, but that's what happens."
227160,232280," And given the fact that Lenovo and framework do exist within the same space, they both make"
232280,233280," laptops."
233280,239960," Say, for example, I can understand why Lenovo, whether they wanted to or not, had to point"
239960,244120," out that their trademark was kind of being infringed and you guys really need to make"
244120,247120," a slightly different looking power button."
247120,253240," So as much as I don't think anyone wanted this to happen, I actually agree."
253240,258240," With Lenovo's cease and desist, clearly framework isn't too salty about it either."
258240,259560," So they are figuring this out."
259560,264720," Now our discussion topic here from Adam from our writing team is why do companies waste"
264720,267120," time and money on things like this?"
267120,268840," And they really sort of have to."
268840,271400," The reason is that they actually have to."
271400,276040," If they want to keep their trademark, then they have to uphold their trademark and they"
276040,281320," have to go after anyone who is illegitimately using their trademark."
281320,286760," And this isn't one of those things where Lenovo tried to trademark an actual circle or putting"
286760,289000," the letter \"I\" in a word."
289000,295960," This is very clearly a logo design and very clearly looked pretty much identical to the"
295960,298040," one that framework was using on the power button."
298040,299120," I do agree with all that."
299120,305600," It is a little annoying because, like I said earlier, that design is very logical for making"
305600,308920," a piece of plastic that would depress down into a button."
308920,309920," Yes."
309920,312400," It was a logo on the product."
312400,313400," Yeah."
313400,315880," It was a functional piece."
315880,321880," So that part is pretty annoying to me, but I do agree with the things that Linus said."
321880,324760," You can use it in court cases."
324760,328360," You can say like, \"Oh, well, they haven't defended this before.\""
328360,332200," So there was precedent set that they wouldn't defend this in the future."
332200,334520," And people have one case based off that."
334520,337400," So you actually do need to defend these things."
337400,343120," Just again, I could see this being annoying for 3D printers that are trying to commercialize"
343120,344120," certain products."
344120,345120," Oh, for sure."
345120,349440," But then again, if you're not trying to make an enclosure for a laptop motherboard, then"
349440,353200," they probably don't have to defend it because you might--"
353200,354680," It's enough removed."
354680,355680," I believe that's how it works."
355680,360040," We're getting into things that we don't necessarily dabble with too much."
360040,364720," Yeah, I'm not an expert, but I do know enough to know that they do actually need to go after"
364720,365720," this."
365720,366720," Yeah."
366720,367720," So, news."
367720,370360," Apple has restricted their ad tracking--"
370360,371360," Yeah."
371360,372360," Sorry."
372360,373920," Apple restricted ad tracking?"
373920,375560," Yes, but not necessarily their own."
375560,376560," Yeah, not their own."
376560,377560," That's the whole point."
377560,378560," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
378560,379560," That's the whole point."
379560,380560," You know what, fine."
380560,381560," Why don't you do it then?"
381560,385480," In Lillelle, Mark German, hopefully I said that, right, predicts that Apple is going"
385480,388440," to significantly expand its own advertising business."
388440,392480," And I was told by Riley that if this guy says something like that, it's like going to"
392480,393480," be a thing."
393480,397120," Apparently, this is technically a rumor, but also not really."
397120,399040," This is hilarious."
399040,405160," This is much more notable because of other recent actions that they have partakened."
405160,410480," They implemented app tracking transparency that requires developers to implement a pop-up"
410480,415200," asking users if they can track them outside of the app."
415200,418160," But it doesn't do that for their own apps."
418160,419160," That's hilarious."
419160,423840," Those are first-party apps with first-party tracking that apparently does not need the"
423840,424840," pop-up."
424840,425840," I am not an Apple user."
425840,431680," It is unclear to me if when you are first setting up an iPhone, does it ask you if it"
431680,433920," is okay to track or not?"
433920,436680," Because that to me completely changes this situation."
436680,439760," Okay, well, why don't you keep talking about it while I go get an iPhone and wipe it?"
439760,440760," Okay, cool."
440760,441760," Yeah."
441760,445560," Because to me, basically, just like on Windows, right, when you're first setting up Windows,"
445560,450880," it asks you a bunch of different things about how, like, \"Oh, can we take diagnostic data"
450880,452200," when we're going to take it anyways?"
452200,456800," But can we take advanced diagnostic data or can we just only take basic diagnostic data,"
456800,459600," et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, all the way through the setup?\""
459600,465280," If it's similar to that, if Apple says, \"Can we track you for advertising reasons, whatever?\""
465280,470400," When you're first setting up your iPhone, then this isn't a big deal to me personally."
470400,473360," I understand other people might disagree."
473360,477400," But if they don't ask you on initial phone setup and then they also don't ask you for"
477400,481480," individual apps, then that's a little bit scummy."
481480,487520," Apparently when Apple first implemented their app tracking transparency system, Apple's"
487520,495120," own ad sales tripled while third-party app companies like Facebook and Snapchat had their"
495120,501640," ad sales drop by 13%, which is like massive when in some cases that's like pretty much"
501640,503080," your entire business."
503080,506120," Apple does sell ads on some of its platforms."
506120,509680," Apparently they are planning on expanding this potentially."
509680,518520," Apple sells ads on Apple News, Stocks, TV+ Sports, and Inside the App Store."
518520,521200," Apparently developers complain with the App Store because they have to pay to get the top"
521200,525320," search result for their app title, but that's a problem with Google and everything else"
525320,526320," as well."
526320,528600," It's almost like monopolies are bad."
528600,529600," Yeah, it's just almost."
529600,532920," Very negative way, but sort of how it works."
532920,534560," Oh man, this is great."
534560,536560," It's so..."
536560,542520," The thing that drives me crazy about Apple is not that they are any more evil than any"
542520,549200," other gigantic member of a monopoly, duopoly, or oligopoly, or whatever."
549200,555120," Basically, any other company that exists within a highly consolidated vertical."
555120,559360," No, they're honestly, they're not really any worse."
559360,561520," What they are is hypocritical."
561520,563320," What they are is arrogant."
563320,565800," What they are is smug."
565800,573000," They'll sit here and wax philosophical about all the ways that we could protect the environment"
573000,576280," and do better and whatever."
576280,581600," And then it comes out that, \"Oh, they're big idea here is that we'll stop shipping chargers"
581600,582600," with our phones.\""
582600,584320," No, that's a cost-saving measure."
584320,586520," That's a cost-saving measure and clever marketing for it."
586520,588760," You never cared about the environment even one bit."
588760,590600," Nothing to do with the decision."
590600,591800," And it's the same thing here."
591800,597000," Apple will talk endlessly about how much they care about user privacy and then they"
597000,601560," will go and put all their Chinese users' data in a data center that is quite literally"
601560,604200," owned by the CCP."
604200,605680," I'm sorry."
605680,611200," Oh, so you care about your users' data as long as your users aren't that color?"
611200,612200," Okay."
612200,613960," Sure, Apple."
613960,615800," Good job."
615800,621240," You care about all this advertising tracking until it's your ad."
621240,622240," Good job."
622240,623240," Well, maybe."
623240,626760," So it's fine, I guess."
626760,632240," You're not really doing anything any worse than anyone else, probably."
632240,637040," But you just are constantly engaging in this double-speak about it."
637040,640680," Just say, \"Yeah, fuck you."
640680,643000," We're going to take all your data.\""
643000,645240," Like, okay, fine."
645240,647000," Unless they're not."
647000,648160," Okay, so here it is."
648160,649360," Which we need to figure out."
649360,650360," Yeah, okay."
650360,653600," All right, so Luke is going to set up an iPhone for probably the first time."
653600,654600," No."
654600,655600," Really?"
655600,656600," I do for a full point."
656600,657600," Ah, okay."
657600,660600," We have an iOS app."
660600,661600," Oh boy."
661600,662600," I don't know."
662600,663600," You want to tell us about it?"
663600,671840," Oh, in the meantime, I should probably tell you guys what's new on the store because"
671840,674680," we have like four topics for the show today."
674680,676080," We got like nothing."
676080,679600," So if there's anything you guys want to hear us discuss, now's a really good time to send"
679600,681360," in a merch message."
681360,685080," And maybe we can go have a look at what it is."
685080,686280," Talk about it on the show."
686280,689480," I don't know what happened to the doc this week."
689480,691680," We know this."
691680,693680," Crap, what's the Wi-Fi password?"
693680,695680," Oh, balls."
695680,696680," I will look it up."
696680,697680," I can look it up."
697680,698680," That's fine."
698680,699680," Okay, you know what?"
699680,700680," No, I'm going to, yeah, yeah, yeah."
700680,701680," You look it up."
701680,703960," I'm going to show off what's new on the store here."
703960,705280," Holy crap."
705280,708560," We have a lot of stuff that's new this week."
708560,709800," Oooookay."
709800,714120," I will go ahead and screen share with y'all."
714120,715120," Here we go."
715120,717480," The RGB hoodie is here."
717480,722000," You probably didn't even notice yet, but I'm actually wearing this hoodie."
722000,726520," It doesn't show up on camera very well, but it has these fun little color flecks."
726520,733640," It's called a multi-nep where they weave in these little colored little bits of other"
733640,736000," colors, not describing it very well."
736000,739720," You know what's easier is probably just going on to the product page and showing you guys"
739720,741000," what it looks like."
741000,742000," So there you go."
742000,744320," Up close, it kind of looks like that."
744320,750200," So it adds just a little bit of fun into an otherwise just comfortable, stretchy, gray"
750200,751720," hoodie."
751720,755040," Another fun thing is that it actually comes with, I think."
755040,756040," Ooh, does it not?"
756040,757040," Okay, I don't know."
757040,759560," I'm not going to say anything then."
759560,760560," Okay."
760560,762560," So that's it."
762560,766800," It's a little stealthy branding down on the Kangaroo Pocket."
766800,769840," Yeah, I think."
769840,770840," Nope."
770840,772480," It doesn't look like it."
772480,773480," What the..."
773480,774960," Oh man, come on."
774960,775960," Is it not true to me?"
775960,777880," Okay, apparently I have to look up the Wi-Fi."
777880,781480," So anyway, so guys want to pick up an RGB hoodie."
781480,783440," We've got those live on the store."
783440,784440," They're awesome."
784440,788320," My favorite shirt so far is the white..."
788320,791200," I think it's just called multi-nep, but that one."
791200,792360," It looks super great."
792360,798280," I know right now on camera from there you can't see it so much, but it looks really, really"
798280,799280," cool."
799280,804280," And it's nice that it isn't just like random paint that was like tossed on it."
804280,806360," It's actually little bits of fabric."
806360,807360," So it feels cool."
807360,808360," It looks great."
808360,812000," I really like the rainbow neck thing."
812000,814480," That's also on the shirt as well, but you don't see that."
814480,820520," On the sweater, you can see for him it's mostly hidden, but for me because I have mine completely"
820520,821520," open."
821520,825360," I kind of lays it on the side and looks kind of cool."
825360,826360," I like it a lot."
826360,827360," These are like our..."
827360,829560," When we got the shirts, I was like, \"Man, I hope we have a gray shirt.\""
829560,832120," I didn't quite get a gray shirt, but I got a gray sweater."
832120,833120," Pretty sweet."
833120,834120," We're getting there."
834120,835120," We're getting there."
835120,838280," In other news, we finally have it."
838280,839920," It finally happened."
839920,846160," The Lambo edition of the LTT water bottle is here."
846160,851840," I don't have any notes on it, and I don't even know where to find it on the store."
851840,853600," Linus is right in front of you."
853600,858400," No, I can see the water bottle, smh-ss."
858400,861680," I just don't know where it is on the store."
861680,863280," I don't know where people can buy it."
863280,866280," It's probably just on the water bottle with its own color thing."
866280,868040," No, it's not."
868040,870000," It's not."
870000,871080," So I don't..."
871080,873320," Oh, it's gray."
873320,874800," Why would it be gray?"
874800,879600," Okay, well, the Lambo edition bottle is here."
879600,880600," Nice."
880600,882560," Okay, it's gray."
882560,883680," So good luck finding it."
883680,889160," If you didn't happen to watch the segment of the show, we'll be changing that."
889160,893160," The color looks very different in person than it does in the photos."
893160,897960," Hopefully, that's just a display calibration thing for me, but it's more of a dark green,"
897960,900080," less of like a neon green."
900080,905960," Hopefully, you guys don't end up thinking that it's a different green or whatever."
905960,906960," How's that set up?"
906960,908400," Oh, you're on data and privacy now."
908400,909400," Okay."
909400,912560," This icon appears when an Apple feature asks you to use your personal information."
912560,916080," You won't see this with every feature since Apple collects this information only when"
916080,921080," needed to enable features, secure our services, or personalize your experience."
921080,922080," There it is."
922080,923080," There's the juicy one."
923080,924880," That's the good one."
924880,927040," Apple believes privacy is a fundamental human right."
927040,931600," So every Apple product is designed to minimize the collection and use of your data."
931600,936120," Use on device processing wherever possible and provide transparency and control over"
936120,937360," your information."
937360,938520," There's learn more or continue."
938520,940240," We're going to continue."
940240,942880," Face ID set up later."
942880,943880," Great pass code."
943880,944880," All right."
944880,945880," PPP."
945880,946880," I don't know."
946880,947880," You're just going to wipe it again anyways."
947880,950320," Yeah, but use one that I will know."
950320,951320," Use the."
951320,952320," Yeah."
952320,953320," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, please."
953320,954320," Change."
954320,955320," Okay."
955320,956320," Thanks."
956320,958080," I would never guess that."
958080,959080," Yeah."
959080,961240," I'm trying to think of this one."
961240,964320," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
964320,965320," Okay."
965320,966320," Cool."
966320,969040," Oh, man."
969040,973680," So honestly, doesn't look great."
973680,978840," Seems like Apple is basically just doing their usual rules for the and not for me."
978840,980200," I haven't even got there yet."
980200,981200," Really?"
981200,983120," Well, I mean, it was right there."
983120,987600," They basically said, yeah, we're not going to collect it except when we need it to personalize"
987600,988600," your experience."
988600,993600," Personalize your experience is just marketing speak, business speak for collect your data"
993600,997880," and serve you people and chat told me that there's an option, but now I need like an apple"
997880,998880," ID to keep going."
998880,1001120," So I'm just going to turn into a whole thing."
1001120,1002120," Okay."
1002120,1003120," Thank you."
1003120,1004120," I have one, but there's like no shot."
1004120,1005120," I remember the password."
1005120,1008960," Yeah, I know mine."
1008960,1014320," But yeah, is that it for the store stuff?"
1014320,1015840," Did you talk about the discount?"
1015840,1017640," No, there's a discount."
1017640,1018640," There is a discount."
1018640,1019640," There is a discount."
1019640,1024720," If for a limited time, you can buy a swack it and get a scarf for 50% off automatically"
1024720,1027120," applied to check out, which is at both the cart."
1027120,1028480," There you go."
1028480,1031200," The screwdriver warranty will be available next week."
1031200,1032200," If you're interested."
1032200,1035200," I will go over that in a bit more detail later."
1035200,1036560," Yeah, there you go."
1036560,1037560," No more information."
1037560,1039400," That's all you get."
1039400,1042080," Other than that, I think it's just things that we'll talk about more later."
1042080,1046320," If I can do another topic right now, I don't know if you've seen this, but the"
1046320,1052160," text message service they're calling the metaverse looks awful."
1052160,1053160," Have you seen this cold?"
1053160,1054160," I did."
1054160,1055160," It looked terrible."
1055160,1056440," It's actually stunning."
1056440,1058160," Like I thought it was a joke."
1058160,1064280," I saw it many times and I thought that just like some YouTuber or TikTok person or something"
1064280,1069640," made a fake image and people were like, that's funny and kept pushing it around."
1069640,1074360," And then only when I sat down here, did I realize that it was actually real and actually"
1074360,1079000," sent out by the Mark himself."
1079000,1081960," But yeah, let's get this on screen."
1081960,1082960," Okay."
1082960,1083960," You want your screen up?"
1083960,1086600," Just right now."
1086600,1088560," So this is an actual message."
1088560,1089560," Wait, what?"
1089560,1090560," From Mark Zuckerberg."
1090560,1091640," I thought this was a joke."
1091640,1092640," And that's exactly."
1092640,1099080," I thought this was like a we like apparently no."
1099080,1101560," Apparently this is Horizon Worlds."
1101560,1103440," We're launching Horizon Worlds in France and Spain today."
1103440,1109160," So it initially launched in like, I think it was Canada, the US and UK."
1109160,1114960," Does he just like have a secret desire to be a Vtuber and the meta building the metaverse?"
1114960,1119440," There's no way because Vtubers look way better."
1119440,1121120," They are way beyond this."
1121120,1124640," Like Vtubers are in a completely different world than this."
1124640,1125640," The really bizarre."
1125640,1126640," You want to say Photoshop?"
1126640,1131440," No, this is paint or like maybe they filled colored cells and Excel or something."
1131440,1134520," This is like pretty much the worst thing I've ever seen."
1134520,1142080," It was pointed out by I believe, Plouff wrote this topic that Horizon Worlds, a free VR"
1142080,1146640," game published by Meta was released in December 9th, 2021."
1146640,1148920," It has an 18 plus age restriction."
1148920,1149920," It was initially released."
1149920,1154480," Canada, the US and UK and it has 300,000 users as of February."
1154480,1162800," Second life, a game released in 2003 initially has 900,000 active users now."
1162800,1167120," Apparently this has been updated."
1167120,1170160," It's somehow worse."
1170160,1176840," That you know, there's this like whole joke that he like people say that he looks like"
1176840,1179160," a lizard or he looks possessed or something."
1179160,1180160," That doesn't help."
1180160,1184840," Yeah, the eyes."
1184840,1187080," I don't think there's a soul behind them."
1187080,1188520," Also the game's already out."
1188520,1190440," So that was a screenshot from the game."
1190440,1194600," So they can't really like make it much better just like that."
1194600,1198040," Like they there's some message that he sent out apparently about how they're going to"
1198040,1200760," be like working on it and improving it."
1200760,1202560," Like yeah, of course."
1202560,1207040," It is not rated very well, but I can't tell if it's just being review bombed because it's"
1207040,1212040," Facebook."
1212040,1214040," Yeah."
1214040,1215040," Yeah."
1215040,1218880," I can't stop looking at this."
1218880,1220800," It's just such a joke."
1220800,1222480," I just can't."
1222480,1224200," Like, oh my goodness."
1224200,1230960," So he's digitally self-ying in front of a monument that looks awful and he looks awful."
1230960,1232480," And the other monument behind it."
1232480,1234320," This is button looks awful."
1234320,1236000," But he just."
1236000,1238240," And the grass looks so amateur."
1238240,1242640," And what I think are potentially trees on a mountain look awful, but I have no idea"
1242640,1244640," what they even are."
1244640,1248520," Yeah, it's it's it's horrible."
1248520,1253800," The discussion question is how is he so proud of something that looks so bad?"
1253800,1255520," Is he genuinely clueless?"
1255520,1258280," Has he never played a video game before?"
1258280,1260240," Even VR chat looks way better than this."
1260240,1261840," Yeah, I honestly don't know."
1261840,1264200," I've been wondering that for quite a while."
1264200,1268080," There are other Oculus first party apps that look wildly better."
1268080,1269480," Like the home."
1269480,1270560," Yeah."
1270560,1272360," That's been out for like ever."
1272360,1273360," Oh, yeah."
1273360,1274880," Astronomically better than this."
1274880,1275880," Oh, yeah."
1275880,1277640," So like it's not like they're not capable of more."
1277640,1281120," The Beat Saber avatars are like on par."
1281120,1282120," Oh, better."
1282120,1283120," And they're not even trying."
1283120,1284120," Yeah."
1284120,1285920," Are you talking about the oh no, you're not okay."
1285920,1287360," No, no, no, that's a different thing."
1287360,1288360," Okay."
1288360,1290840," I was thinking about the like avatar that you use when you have the like."
1290840,1291840," No, no, no, that's."
1291840,1292840," That's a different thing."
1292840,1297440," That's um, oh, VR me or something like that."
1297440,1298440," VR me."
1298440,1302160," I've ready player ready player me."
1302160,1309280," Yeah, you can create you can create an avatar of yourself at this level of quality in like"
1309280,1311040," minutes here."
1311040,1312760," Choose your body type."
1312760,1313760," Take a photo."
1313760,1314760," A lot."
1314760,1316280," Look, we're going to we're going to go through the process."
1316280,1319560," I'm going to make yeah, I'm going to make a better avatar than Mark Zuckerberg with his"
1319560,1322040," billions of dollars and metaverse funding."
1322040,1323800," And I'm going to do it on this crappy webcam."
1323800,1325800," One moment, please."
1325800,1330000," Oh, oh no, I should pick a file."
1330000,1331000," I should pick a file."
1331000,1332000," Back on to hold on."
1332000,1333080," That's a good idea."
1333080,1337160," So that that updated picture that you posted, there's also an updated like landscape and"
1337160,1343680," architecture textures, models, meshes, whatever you want to call it picture."
1343680,1344880," They got posted on Instagram."
1344880,1349200," I have that post from Zuck himself."
1349200,1352600," But we'll we'll show that after."
1352600,1355160," Oh, perfect."
1355160,1356160," So good."
1356160,1357160," Here we go."
1357160,1360240," It's the widest chin."
1360240,1362240," Okay."
1362240,1366960," Yes, that is Linus."
1366960,1368120," It's perfect."
1368120,1371520," I've never seen anything that looks more like Linus before."
1371520,1373960," I mean, it's not great."
1373960,1377160," Here, let's just look at the beard."
1377160,1379480," It's because it's using generic like pre-made."
1379480,1380480," You know what?"
1380480,1381480," You know what?"
1381480,1382480," Not bad."
1382480,1383480," It's okay."
1383480,1388440," Better than better than I think it's using canned like model things."
1388440,1389440," Okay."
1389440,1392240," So you can go to my screen."
1392240,1393680," These are the updated ones."
1393680,1394680," Oh my God."
1394680,1395680," This is so scary."
1395680,1396680," Okay."
1396680,1399880," It is worlds better than the thing on the left."
1399880,1400880," Yeah."
1400880,1401880," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
1401880,1412520," And I would say this looks more like James than like me, but this also doesn't look."
1412520,1413600," Yeah, it's okay."
1413600,1414600," It's Mark."
1414600,1418480," It's Mark, but he also has a very distinctive gigantic forehead and very short haircut."
1418480,1421120," So hard to say, hard to say."
1421120,1429800," Either way, the fact that this was just a simple little like character creator thing."
1429800,1432400," It can be put into VR to be clear."
1432400,1433400," Oh, yeah."
1433400,1434400," Oh, yeah."
1434400,1435400," Yeah."
1435400,1441520," So this is what I used to create the model that I use for full body streaming bead saber."
1441520,1442520," And it was simple."
1442520,1444360," I'm going to show my screen real quick."
1444360,1448200," So this bottom one, which I'll raise up so it gets above our camera."
1448200,1451640," This is the like landscape architecture textures thing that I was mentioning."
1451640,1455640," So that looks wildly better than what it looked like in the picture."
1455640,1459880," And I would say while this still doesn't look like necessarily that great, there is"
1459880,1464720," an art style going on here and it is wildly better than the previous one."
1464720,1469080," The thing that I don't understand is I can't go back."
1469080,1470080," Oh, no."
1470080,1471080," Oh, no."
1471080,1473080," Can I help you?"
1473080,1474080," Oh, okay."
1474080,1475080," There we go."
1475080,1481640," The thing that I don't understand is why you would like don't talk about that first one."
1481640,1483000," That shouldn't be released."
1483000,1484640," That should never be seen publicly."
1484640,1486880," Like that is trash."
1486880,1489520," The second one looks like it could be pretty good."
1489520,1492760," Like I could with with the art style and whatnot that's going on with this model thing."
1492760,1495560," I think people could accomplish things that look pretty good."
1495560,1499280," And with the architecture and textures and whatnot in the lower picture."
1499280,1500840," I yeah."
1500840,1504360," So what someone's one of the comments I actually completely grew with this one of the comments"
1504360,1507680," says, wait a minute, that screenshot is from a modded copy of Skyrim."
1507680,1513440," I don't think that's like true, but it actually it looks like it is."
1513440,1516040," But for a VR game, you know, it like it's whatever."
1516040,1520680," But yeah, that first picture is just so incredibly bad that I can't believe it was ever allowed"
1520680,1522680," to be viewed publicly."
1522680,1525800," Yeah, very interesting."
1525800,1526800," Okay."
1526800,1532560," Why don't we jump into a couple of merge messages just so that people can instead of"
1532560,1537040," guys remember don't send super chats or bits on Twitch or whatever else."
1537040,1540000," I'm not like being like, oh, reverse psychology."
1540000,1541160," You should definitely send."
1541160,1543160," No, do not send them."
1543160,1547320," If you want to, if you want to interact with the show, it's far better to pick something"
1547320,1549040," up on LTT store.com."
1549040,1552920," Whenever we're live, you'll see a field in the checkout that will prompt you to send"
1552920,1556600," a merge message that will go through to our producer Colton today."
1556600,1561600," And he will either have it pop up on the screen down below or he will curate it so that we"
1561600,1562920," can address it later."
1562920,1566320," So if you have any suggestions for topics you want us to talk about, that is the best"
1566320,1567600," way to send them to us."
1567600,1570120," I know that it requires money."
1570120,1576120," But at least unlike a super chat, you actually get something cool in the mail after spending"
1576120,1579040," your money, even if we don't happen to address your topic."
1579040,1582520," That's why we don't recommend the super chats is just the values."
1582520,1584120," The value of merge messages is much higher."
1584120,1589080," Yeah, because like you get like a hoodie or like, you know, some hair scrunchies or whatever"
1589080,1590920," else it is that you happen to need."
1590920,1591920," Sure."
1591920,1592920," All right."
1592920,1596040," This first one comes from Tommy and is probably for Linus."
1596040,1599480," Watched for almost 10 years and you've taught me the principles that shaped who I am today."
1599480,1601640," Oh, that's so sweet."
1601640,1604920," What are some important lessons you teach your kids?"
1604920,1607000," Oh, run with scissors."
1607000,1609680," No, that's bad, Luke."
1609680,1614000," Yeah, who taught you that wasn't me."
1614000,1616600," Man, I don't know."
1616600,1621160," I guess there's like, there's a few things that I'm super hard line about."
1621160,1624800," Like one of the things that I will say to my kids constantly is nothing worth doing is"
1624800,1625800," easy."
1625800,1629440," Whenever they complain that something takes a long time or is hard, I'll basically"
1629440,1633520," just like it's like it's one of my stereotypical dad responses like, yeah, well, if it was"
1633520,1634720," easy, it wouldn't be worth doing."
1634720,1637680," So good thing it isn't because otherwise you're wasting your time."
1637680,1640240," Like that's sort of the rationale."
1640240,1641680," If it's easy, anyone can do it."
1641680,1646160," So if it's hard, then you know, put your head down and get at it."
1646160,1647200," Embrace the suck."
1647200,1649760," Yeah, another big one is manners cost nothing."
1649760,1657000," I don't actually phrase it that way, but I am an absolute Nazi when it comes to please."
1657000,1658000," Thank you."
1658000,1659000," Excuse me."
1659000,1660000," I have witnessed this."
1660000,1665720," Yeah, I'm like brutal when it comes to that stuff."
1665720,1668000," I will, I will, I will pretend my kids don't exist."
1668000,1675080," If I do not hear, please, you know, even like men, they'll be like hurt and crying and want"
1675080,1676240," me to pick them up."
1676240,1680320," And I'll be like, oh my."
1680320,1681680," Oh, for real though."
1681680,1684000," That I have a witness for real though."
1684000,1692320," And the reason for it is that it costs nothing and means everything to other people."
1692320,1698480," So for me, it's less about the actual words and it's more about taking that fraction of"
1698480,1705200," a second to be appreciative or be grateful or acknowledge that you've done something that"
1705200,1708480," you, you shouldn't have or whatever it is."
1708480,1714360," And it costs absolutely nothing and makes you a more pleasant human being to interact with."
1714360,1716080," So so that that's a big one."
1716080,1721920," It's just, it's, it's just part of the overall, just be respectful to other people."
1721920,1722920," I don't know."
1722920,1728800," I mean, there's just, there's not much other than just like don't be a jackass, I guess."
1728800,1730640," The old wise words of Bill and Ted."
1730640,1731640," Yeah."
1731640,1732640," Yeah."
1732640,1733640," Be excellent to each other, right?"
1733640,1737640," Like it's, oh, I mean one that I harp on a lot, I guess is your siblings for life, figure"
1737640,1738640," it out."
1738640,1746520," You know, we don't really, we don't really tolerate them speaking to each other disrespectfully."
1746520,1749560," Like if they, oh, a whining is another one."
1749560,1754280," So if they, if they whine about anything, you know, one of my big ones is like, what's"
1754280,1756440," the purpose of what you just said?"
1756440,1757880," Will it make this faster?"
1757880,1758880," No?"
1758880,1759880," Okay."
1759880,1760880," Will it make us all more comfortable?"
1760880,1761880," No?"
1761880,1762880," Okay."
1762880,1763880," Well, then stop."
1763880,1766840," And it's, I don't know, my kids are amazing because that kind of stuff actually works and"
1766840,1768800," it definitely wouldn't have worked on me."
1768800,1769800," I was awful."
1769800,1771000," Like you couldn't go to a restaurant with me."
1771000,1772360," I was like bouncing off the walls."
1772360,1773360," Like, that makes sense."
1773360,1774360," Yeah."
1774360,1775360," Thanks for that."
1775360,1776360," No problem."
1776360,1777360," I've been around Linus's kids."
1777360,1778360," They're very well behaved."
1778360,1779360," They are."
1779360,1780360," So kudos."
1780360,1781360," All right."
1781360,1782360," Next one comes from McGregor."
1782360,1787040," And they say, he says, they say he, high Linus, I worked for a T-Mobile dealer and was"
1787040,1790960," wondering if you've ever thought about doing a video like Secret Shopper, but for cell service"
1790960,1793640," providers instead of PC retailers."
1793640,1798640," We'd love to."
1798640,1808520," The problem is that there are so many facets to a service provider that are device specific."
1808520,1810760," I wanted to rage at Teles last show."
1810760,1811760," Sorry?"
1811760,1813600," I wanted to rage at Teles last show."
1813600,1814600," Yeah."
1814600,1815600," Yeah."
1815600,1818720," I mean, there's- And like, I still think they're the best option locally for internet because"
1818720,1821440," of Shaw's whole fake fiber thing and stuff."
1821440,1822440," Yep."
1822440,1823440," It was, yeah."
1823440,1824440," I've had good experiences."
1824440,1826800," I've had bad experience with every telco."
1826800,1834120," I just- When your company's that big too, it's the chance you get someone really good"
1834120,1838040," versus the chance you get someone really high is there's like such a huge pool of people"
1838040,1839480," that they could land on."
1839480,1840480," I don't know."
1840480,1841480," Yeah."
1841480,1842480," It's tough."
1842480,1845160," All right."
1845160,1846760," Next question comes from Top Sponge."
1846760,1850920," Hey, Linus, do the writers have any kind of partial ownership of the channel they focus"
1850920,1851920," on?"
1851920,1856280," What people does Jonathan have partial ownership and MAC address, Riley, tech linked, etc."
1856280,1859000," If not, is that something you never consider?"
1859000,1860000," That's a good question."
1860000,1865120," Right now, all the IP is held by Linus Media Group Inc."
1865120,1874840," I think that- Yeah, it's honestly a bigger debate than one that we can really have here"
1874840,1876280," on this show."
1876280,1885400," I think you're getting into kind of like a man, what's the term I'm looking for?"
1885400,1890600," Basically it's like a capitalist versus more communist type of philosophy."
1890600,1893240," So ownership of the means of production."
1893240,1894240," Right?"
1894240,1899080," So- Yeah, because I don't think you can stop at the writers because what if there's a writer"
1899080,1900080," that doesn't- That's ridiculous."
1900080,1902960," What if the writer doesn't host?"
1902960,1905280," Why don't the editors and shooters have anything in this?"
1905280,1906280," Yeah."
1906280,1907280," Yeah."
1907280,1908280," Like what about logistics?"
1908280,1910160," Why don't they own some of the channel?"
1910160,1911600," They hope to produce it."
1911600,1919520," You know, our approach up until now has been that, you know, no, we pay well."
1919520,1924400," If you were to- I think that if you were to come in with some kind of asset and that"
1924400,1930600," was part of the deal of bringing you into the company, like let's say for example we"
1930600,1935920," were to- Okay, here, I'll use UFD since he actually did an April Fools joke that we"
1935920,1937000," acquired him."
1937000,1942420," So if we were to- if we were to hire Brett, then as part of that deal I might say, \"Hey"
1942420,1946120," Brett, we also want to acquire your channel.\""
1946120,1951920," You know, he might come back to me and say, \"Well, I would be comfortable selling a portion"
1951920,1956760," of the channel, but I'd like to retain let's say a 25% stake."
1956760,1961000," So in the event that you were to ever sell that asset, I would get part of the payout,"
1961000,1962000," right?"
1962000,1964120," That might be part of the conversation that we had about it."
1964120,1969480," But because that asset was created from the ground up using Linus Media Group resources,"
1969480,1973560," no, there is no ownership stake from the channel writer."
1973560,1980040," You know, Jonathan Horst, for example, didn't even work here yet when we conceptualized starting"
1980040,1981040," up that channel."
1981040,1987480," You know, he didn't work on, say for example, the art assets, so where- where Sarah's take,"
1987480,1988480," right?"
1988480,1994560," No, everyone was working as an employee here at the company and the asset is owned by the"
1994560,1996360," company, not even me personally."
1996360,1999800," And I know that that's a distinction that won't matter to a lot of you, but legally it"
1999800,2000800," does."
2000800,2003400," All right, I got another one."
2003400,2004880," This one comes from Randall."
2004880,2008920," What phone is your favorite of all phones you've used as your daily driver?"
2008920,2013760," Now I'm going to get Luke to go first because I think he hates all of them."
2013760,2015000," And that's funny."
2015000,2016000," Of all time?"
2016000,2017000," Is that so like-"
2017000,2018000," Yeah, I think so."
2018000,2023280," In that moment in time, I'm trying to remember the name of it is Samsung Galaxy S3."
2023280,2027400," Is that right way of saying that?"
2027400,2029320," The one that had the removable back and battery?"
2029320,2031440," Yeah, I think the S3 had a removable back."
2031440,2032440," Yeah."
2032440,2033360," Yeah, I loved that phone."
2033360,2035040," It felt indestructible."
2035040,2040560," I remember multiple times dropping it and it would just explode every single time."
2040560,2042480," The back would go flying in one direction."
2042480,2044440," The battery would go flying in another direction."
2044440,2047960," The phone itself would skid somewhere else and then it would be fine."
2047960,2048960," Every single time."
2048960,2055320," There was one time where I was running at school and I jumped over a fence and it was"
2055320,2057280," in my sweater pocket."
2057280,2063160," So I already decently tall and then I jumped and then it went flying up out."
2063160,2072160," So it got some like air and whacked into concrete and blew up everywhere and I put it back together"
2072160,2075400," going like there's no way this is going to work and it immediately turned back on and"
2075400,2076400," was like, I'm fine."
2076400,2082520," And that thing was a tank and it was also like pretty fast and felt pretty nice for its"
2082520,2083520," time."
2083520,2084520," Phones used to be durable, man."
2084520,2088680," I dropped my Samsung jive off the back of a cantoring horse."
2088680,2092520," I don't know why I was trying to use my phone on the back of a horse while I was at running"
2092520,2093520," speed."
2093520,2094520," Yeah."
2094520,2096160," But it hit the ground, exploded."
2096160,2097160," Yeah."
2097160,2098160," Right."
2098160,2099160," Yeah."
2099160,2101640," Put it back to each other and it fired up."
2101640,2104640," I guess that would maybe be one of my, one of my favorite phones."
2104640,2108360," The only thing I liked about it was it had this ringtone that I really liked."
2108360,2111000," I've never had a better ringtone than that one."
2111000,2114000," If I could find it, I would totally put it on my current phone."
2114000,2116920," But for me, I'd say I have to pick the note nine."
2116920,2122240," It's the most complete phone ever in my opinion."
2122240,2128320," It has a non picture based face unlock with their iris scanner that I don't believe was"
2128320,2130800," was it present in the note seven?"
2130800,2132720," I'm trying to remember the one that blew up."
2132720,2134160," I think I think it might have been."
2134160,2136320," But it went away after the note nine."
2136320,2143320," So it had an iris scanner, which came in handy for me a lot while all the definitely"
2143320,2148060," savvy shoppers with iPhones were pulling their masks off to use face ID and putting them"
2148060,2149060," back on."
2149060,2151080," I was able to use iris scan."
2151080,2157800," Also, it has a like a touch sensor, a fingerprint sensor that is not Samsung's new ultrasonic"
2157800,2160520," one that is slow and inaccurate and basically sucks."
2160520,2162120," Had a headphone jack."
2162120,2165800," The one thing that it didn't have is an IR emitter."
2165800,2172680," Like other than that, it had basically everything SD expansion notes are always very like every"
2172680,2178880," feature possible were it didn't have a removable battery, but it's also not a ton of work to"
2178880,2182240," swap the battery in that particular device wireless charging."
2182240,2185720," No reverse wireless charging, but that's something that even on a device that I believe"
2185720,2186720," this one has it."
2186720,2187720," I don't know."
2187720,2188720," I've never checked."
2188720,2189720," I would never use that."
2189720,2192120," I've never checked for this, but I always kind of liked the removable battery because"
2192120,2196320," of the drop it and it explodes thing because I always had the like thought in my head that"
2196320,2199360," it might be similar to kind of like ceramics."
2199360,2203800," Like some of the force goes in throwing that back plate and that battery and stuff like"
2203800,2204800," that instead of it."
2204800,2205800," Oh, that's totally a thing."
2205800,2206800," Smashing something."
2206800,2210640," So I kind of liked the idea that when I dropped my phone, it would kind of blow up like that"
2210640,2213560," because it's like, it's not like I'm not going to find the back plate."
2213560,2217640," I still think it's a bug rather than a feature, but sure, I see where you're coming from."
2217640,2218640," Yeah."
2218640,2219640," And I'm okay with a bug."
2219640,2220640," Lego phones."
2220640,2221640," Just."
2221640,2228200," I mean, they wouldn't do that unless it received a significant amount of force."
2228200,2229200," So I don't know."
2229200,2230440," I was always down with it."
2230440,2231440," D boss."
2231440,2232440," Yes, we do."
2232440,2233680," All right."
2233680,2236200," This next one, I'm going to apologize to you, Linus."
2236200,2237360," This one comes from Andrew."
2237360,2238360," Hey, everyone."
2238360,2240320," I was so excited for the channel Superphone on Flowplane."
2240320,2241640," It was so hilarious."
2241640,2246000," Linus in two words, how much damage did Dennis cause to your house?"
2246000,2247480," I think you could use one word."
2247480,2252880," I'm going to check the wording here because it's funny that you would say Dennis caused"
2252880,2256560," the damage to my house and not Dennis and Colton."
2256560,2257560," Whoa, whoa, whoa."
2257560,2258560," Cause to my house."
2258560,2260560," Don't involve me."
2260560,2262520," Definitely does say just Dennis, but sorry."
2262520,2267280," I get two words to describe the damage you guys did to the house."
2267280,2269200," Yeah."
2269200,2272600," Thousands and dollars."
2272600,2273600," It was pretty bad."
2273600,2274680," How about that?"
2274680,2275680," So they."
2275680,2280960," They wanged the banister, which is a pretty small fix."
2280960,2281960," Yeah."
2281960,2288960," A little bit of wood filler, some primer, sand, prime paint, maybe sand again, paint again."
2288960,2292880," You could probably, you could smooth that out, but the damage they did to the floor in"
2292880,2299680," the main bedroom would necessitate taking a not insubstantial amount."
2299680,2301600," It's basically not fixable."
2301600,2307360," By the time they sanded the entire floor down enough to take out the gas that they put in"
2307360,2314800," the middle of my brand new, by the way, this is literally brand new flooring that was installed"
2314800,2319280," fresh as part of this renovation, the gas they put in the floor, they would have to"
2319280,2323800," take off so much of the top surface of it that you would actually have to pull off the base"
2323800,2328080," boards, move them down and repaint the walls."
2328080,2335160," You would basically have to remodel the entire f***ing room to undo the damage that they"
2335160,2336160," did."
2336160,2337160," It was really bad."
2337160,2341360," It was a pretty deep gouge and we tried moving the bed at least three times."
2341360,2344400," On the first time, I was like, this is not what this should sound like Dennis."
2344400,2345400," Let's go get a Vaughn."
2345400,2348440," And he's like, no, no, no, we got this."
2348440,2349440," I believe you."
2349440,2350440," Just horrifying."
2350440,2351440," No, we have."
2351440,2352440," You were the adults in the room."
2352440,2353440," We have."
2353440,2354440," You bear part of the responsibility."
2354440,2355440," We have video evidence."
2355440,2356440," For you."
2356440,2357440," Cool."
2357440,2358920," I'm not going to lie."
2358920,2360920," I don't."
2360920,2366620," I think the I don't know how many times have I like yelled at our staff, like CEO yelling"
2366620,2367620," it."
2367620,2369280," What do you mean yell like straight up yell yell?"
2369280,2370280," Yeah, like mad yell."
2370280,2371520," Like not just like speaking passionately."
2371520,2372520," You get quiet."
2372520,2374280," Yeah, he gets quiet when he's really mad."
2374280,2375280," I haven't heard."
2375280,2376280," Not that often."
2376280,2378080," I can definitely remember a few but not that often."
2378080,2379080," Okay."
2379080,2380080," We have a favorite one."
2380080,2381080," Hit me with one."
2381080,2383040," I have one that I remember that was like really good."
2383040,2385160," I was I was furious."
2385160,2387360," My favorite one was at my parents house."
2387360,2388360," Oh, what was that one?"
2388360,2389360," I don't know."
2389360,2390360," I'm going to do this."
2390360,2392240," Oh, were you there?"
2392240,2393240," I heard about this."
2393240,2394240," Okay."
2394240,2397000," Was that me was I off camera though or was I having it up for camera?"
2397000,2398000," You're off camera."
2398000,2399000," Okay."
2399000,2400000," What did I what was it then?"
2400000,2401000," I don't even remember."
2401000,2405280," Well, technically, okay, technically it was filmed."
2405280,2409720," There is footage of it, but like it wasn't we weren't like supposed like a camera would"
2409720,2411720," just happen to be rolling."
2411720,2414880," But someone was trying to because so."
2414880,2421680," There was like judging happening in the family room and the judges wrote in the garage and"
2421680,2426640," you were able to monitor the filming and stuff that was happening in the family room,"
2426640,2429000," but you needed people to start shooting in the garage."
2429000,2432560," And if you remember, like the whole reason why we were there was because the day was"
2432560,2436080," crazy because the power was out at the office and like all these things were going weird."
2436080,2440720," So it's a very stressful day and then filming was like not happening correctly."
2440720,2441720," And you."
2441720,2443520," Yeah, I don't want to recreate it."
2443520,2446120," Were we filming channels super fun too at the same time?"
2446120,2447400," Yes, at the field."
2447400,2449400," Yes, with the bumper balls or whatever it was."
2449400,2451160," Yeah, that was a interesting day."
2451160,2452160," That was a stressful day."
2452160,2456320," I think I've only seen you yell twice maybe and I don't remember the exact situations."
2456320,2462880," The time that I remember because I was I was more furious than almost any other time I"
2462880,2469240," can remember running this company was when we lost a shoot due to utter carelessness."
2469240,2475400," Just like completely were like dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, lost the SD card"
2475400,2478640," that had the entire footage for our shoot on it."
2478640,2480480," This was a long time ago."
2480480,2481480," It was a long time ago."
2481480,2483120," Yeah, very, very vague memories of this."
2483120,2486840," Yeah, that was that was back at the at the Langley house."
2486840,2493600," So there's there's not many times that I have like yelled at people unironically."
2493600,2497280," And I wasn't even yelling at a person in that case because it wasn't an individual that"
2497280,2498600," was responsible for it."
2498600,2501320," It was one of those as a team."
2501320,2505680," We were just being utterly careless with our data."
2505680,2510200," And I find it's not the size of the transgression."
2510200,2513080," It's the necessity of the transgression."
2513080,2517520," And losing that data was utterly unnecessary."
2517520,2521560," It basically was a combination of it's a boiling again."
2521560,2524520," Otter, Otter apathy and incompetence."
2524520,2526840," There was just no other way that it could have happened."
2526840,2528360," You can't lose footage like that."
2528360,2534800," And and I and the specific circumstances around it though, sometimes bad stuff happens."
2534800,2536120," And I'm understanding of that."
2536120,2538160," Like we've we had people."
2538160,2544200," I don't think I even yelled when someone who's no longer here left an entire camera bag full"
2544200,2550800," of camera media, everything just like sitting in front of a lobby in Vegas."
2550800,2552240," Just got in the cab without it."
2552240,2553560," Just left it there."
2553560,2556520," Like I like stuff happens."
2556520,2562440," So when it's when you had every opportunity in the world to back up the data and you just"
2562440,2567240," didn't, then I get then I start to get really frustrated."
2567240,2572800," So I was not as mad as I was when we lost the data."
2572800,2579600," But because of how unnecessary the damage was to the floor."
2579600,2581080," I didn't mince words."
2581080,2585080," I think I made it clear that I was extremely unhappy with the result."
2585080,2586080," Thank you for."
2586080,2587080," I was there when I found it."
2587080,2588080," Yeah."
2588080,2589080," You were there when I found it?"
2589080,2590080," Yeah."
2590080,2591080," Oh yeah."
2591080,2592080," Okay."
2592080,2593080," That's a good question."
2593080,2593720," He sent a message and I was I read the message and I immediately understood the severity of"
2593720,2597360," said message."
2597360,2598520," I didn't yell though."
2598520,2599520," Nope."
2599520,2601040," I don't I don't think yelling is healthy."
2601040,2602520," I don't think it's constructive."
2602520,2605960," There was a company that I used to work with."
2605960,2610760," Like back when I was a product manager and I was told that their their boardroom meetings"
2610760,2616600," would often devolve into people yelling and literally screaming at each other."
2616600,2624440," And I was I heard this and I just went what what on what possible reason could you have"
2624440,2628520," to be yelling at each other in a business meeting aren't you all on the same team."
2628520,2632160," I interviewed somebody a few weeks ago for one of the business job postings we have opened"
2632160,2635200," and when we're talking about you know why what's wrong with your current position they"
2635200,2639200," were saying like hey the work conditions here aren't good and kind of dug into that a little"
2639200,2643680," bit and it basically was like yeah the way that we deal with any issue larger small is"
2643680,2648000," just screaming at each other and I was like oh that doesn't seem very constructive."
2648000,2649000," So yeah."
2649000,2650000," Okay."
2650000,2654960," Why don't we jump into another topic while Colton digs through some of these incoming"
2654960,2656460," merch messages."
2656460,2657880," People are pretty into the new stuff."
2657880,2662480," Oh you know what one last thing just because we do need to keep all the merch messages for"
2662480,2669160," those of you who were waiting holding out holding out for a guarantee a warranty on the backpack"
2669160,2670160," it's here."
2670160,2671160," It's here."
2671160,2672160," It's here."
2672160,2679880," This is the trust me bro guarantee limited lifetime warranty."
2679880,2684240," We offer a limited lifetime warranty that the LTT backpack is free from manufacturing"
2684240,2685800," and material defects."
2685800,2690160," The limited lifetime warranty is valid for the usual and customary life of the LTT backpack."
2690160,2693280," The manner in which the LTT backpack is used to directly impacts the usual and customary"
2693280,2696520," life of the product as materials will deteriorate and fade over time and moving parts such as"
2696520,2698000," zippers will also wear."
2698000,2701960," The limited lifetime warranty does not cover damages caused by misuse, abuse or by accident"
2701960,2706360," or negligence damage caused by rips cuts or tears normal wear and tear including the breakdown"
2706360,2707760," of materials over time."
2707760,2711520," Products purchased from unauthorized dealers cosmetic damage or unauthorized modification"
2711520,2713000," or alteration."
2713000,2716200," In order to make a warranty claim you must be the original purchaser of the LTT backpack"
2716200,2720720," from LTT store.com or provide a copy of the original proof of purchase."
2720720,2724280," So we do actually cover."
2724280,2727600," We do actually cover secondary owners or tertiary owners."
2727600,2728600," We don't care."
2728600,2732760," The reason that we have that in there like that and that we require the original proof"
2732760,2737960," of purchase is that we can validate that it's not a counterfeit backpack."
2737960,2739920," So there it is."
2739920,2747600," Before you ask yes we had a look at what was standard in the sort of wearable on your back"
2747600,2753880," textiles or over your shoulders textiles industry and this is pretty much right in there with"
2753880,2761720," everyone who has what was what we were told was a really really good warranty policy."
2761720,2765760," With the one difference being that from my point of view the whole original purchaser"
2765760,2769280," thing has never made any sense either you did a good job of making it or you didn't"
2769280,2771200," and it shouldn't really matter who's back it's on."
2771200,2774680," So we don't care about that we just do need to make sure that they're not counterfeit"
2774680,2775680," bags."
2775680,2777880," So we have to validate that you have an original proof of purchase."
2777880,2780320," I've heard that's what it's kind of central around."
2780320,2781320," It is."
2781320,2782320," Yeah."
2782320,2783320," Yeah that's the reason for it."
2783320,2789120," I mean yeah I really think that it shouldn't be that hard if you're just contact support."
2789120,2793720," Yeah we should be able to figure it out."
2793720,2795200," There you go."
2795200,2796200," Whoo."
2796200,2799800," Should we talk about screwdriver or topics topics?"
2799800,2806520," Yeah let's talk about a topic let's do it."
2806520,2810120," Let's see here we've got a few good ones we talked about metaverse already oh that's"
2810120,2816360," the main one I was excited about so garbage Airbnb do we want to talk about this this"
2816360,2821320," isn't super interesting to me I'm just gonna be one one more thing X war two says at line"
2821320,2827840," is at Luke I've seen so many people who outside of never having read a warranty before think"
2827840,2833200," that you developed the trust me brochure from your own impulse as far as the public"
2833200,2839000," can tell it was asked for by a fan on Twitter is that true yes it was actually requested"
2839000,2848520," I thought it was hilarious and so I did it."
2848520,2850080," Apple kernel exploit didn't hear about it."
2850080,2851080," He doesn't approve."
2851080,2852080," No I don't."
2852080,2855280," It sold really well people love it."
2855280,2858080," Just smash it."

2861960,2865640," company at this point we sold a hundred of them for every person who has said it was"
2865640,2873000," childish or petty I'm serious it's like not even close maybe there's a lot of childish"
2873000,2879680," petty people out there that's okay yeah okay should we talk about maybe John Deere with"

3034240,3041360," the original context is like trash yeah but it's yeah yes but it's not like okay so what"
3041360,3045120," I should have said is not necessarily related to the backpack oh I like it related to like"
3045120,3050800," what they're doing sure yeah it's kind of its own thing should we talk about john deer"
3050800,3054280," should we talk about potential branding for the lab let's talk about john deer I want"
3054280,3059240," to get into that this is really exciting because you know yes john deer I'm happy this community"
3059240,3064760," is getting behind this it's a good thing yeah this weekend australian hacker sick codes"
3064760,3071080," showed off doom running on the touch screen of a john deer 4240 universal display not"
3071080,3078560," not the 4240 tractor the 4240 universal display to the crowds of defcon 30 in las vegas the"
3078560,3084000," monolithic tractor behemoth monolithic tractor behemoth okay known for their green and yellow"
3084000,3088360," color scheme and putting anti repair software in the machines have been releasing touch screen"
3088360,3093720," farming equipment for over a decade sick codes mentioned he was working on right to repair"
3093720,3098880," hacks for farming equipment during a presentation at last years defcon about tractor application"
3098880,3104280," programming bugs and exploits which is fantastic because what john deer is doing is complete"
3104280,3112440," bs farmers were not happy with the farmers were not happy with the talk publicly revealing"
3112440,3118360," so many vulnerabilities because some brands like john deer don't allow diy firmware updates"
3118360,3125200," yeah but you need to do that so they fix it yeah because otherwise they won't fix it and"
3125200,3132920," someone somewhere knows about the vulnerability so get ready for that sick code says in quotes"
3132920,3139200," I heard from some farmers one guy emailed me saying uh where is it you're f*cking up all"
3139200,3143920," of our stuff so I figured I would put my money where my mouth is and actually prove to farmers"
3143920,3150440," that they can root the devices that's awesome what an amazing response to that that's fantastic"
3150440,3157960," sigma sigma energy yeah um call himself Chad codes um this all comes after john deer facing"
3157960,3162800," mounting pressures announced in march that it would make more of its repair software available"
3162800,3167040," to equipment owners and finally allow them to update their tractor for more of themselves"
3167040,3171000," this isn't going to happen until next year though and honestly I suspect it will happen"
3171000,3174960," with many caveats I'm adding that little bit in myself uh vulnerabilities will remain on"
3174960,3179320," tractors not serviced directly by john deer approved technicians and touch screens like"
3179320,3183440," the run one running doom are designed to be remotely accessed to manage features like"
3183440,3192360," geo fencing and curve use discussion question is there a more anti user company right now"
3192360,3204640," than john deer um I mean I would say that you could easily find other companies that are"
3204640,3211520," very anti consumer but what makes it particularly offensive when it comes to john deer is that"
3211520,3217760," this is essential this is food is essential it's food and these machines are expensive"
3217760,3223680," yeah and a lot of the expenses like people farmers taking these like massive loans out"
3223680,3229480," so they can keep doing their jobs yeah and they're relying on these machines for very"
3229480,3235280," long periods of time like you buy one of these things and you lose you use it for like extreme"
3235280,3239040," amounts of time and you maintain it and you you wrench on it and you work on it yourself"
3239040,3243160," like so by taking that away from them that's like super messed up like apple pulls a lot"
3243160,3252240," of extreme dickhead moves for sure but realistically you don't need an iphone um so you know I"
3252240,3260000," would say in terms of of the of the destructive the destructive nature of what john deer is"
3260000,3267240," doing um they they're they're much closer to you know the the the mega the mega corporations"
3267240,3271600," that are buying up residential properties for example and pushing homeownership out of"
3271600,3274800," reach of an entire generation that that's a little bit different than what the question"
3274800,3279960," asked though because it specifically says anti user not like anti people people are"
3279960,3283920," users users are people I mean what's the difference from my point of view use the I would say"
3283920,3290840," the user of a rental property is a user like I just I just mean like it's it's just extremely"
3290840,3295920," when when we talk about how horrible what someone is doing is uh you know we can talk"
3295920,3303120," about uh we can talk about like uh okay the the pop bottling companies that are taking"
3303120,3307680," all the water while mexico is facing an enormous like life threatening drought or what is it"
3307680,3313440," like nestly buying like absolutely insane amounts of water from Canada for like a cent"
3313440,3319880," have you heard about that stuff just absolutely absurd um so so you know when when we yeah"
3319880,3325880," so it's not necessarily how egregious what they're doing is but the fact that it affects"
3325880,3331880," our ability to eat uh eat get shelter uh that's where it becomes just morally repressed"
3331880,3338960," I've also just never understood like why are you messing with farmers like I don't know"
3338960,3345840," just they seem like the just this very like hearty gritty type of people that just want"
3345840,3351120," to get stuff done you're selling them a machine that they for an extremely long period of"
3351120,3355160," time have been buying these types of machines and maintaining them for huge amounts of time"
3355160,3359200," there's like massive customer loyalty John Deere has got to be one of the highest like"
3359200,3364240," customer loyalty brands ever especially before all this started happening well the reason"
3364240,3369280," you do it is because of this you want to sell your service stuff well not just that right"
3369280,3376400," but there's this perception that in a in a capitalist society unless you are growing"
3376400,3381440," you are failing um and and I mean you'll like I I remember especially when I was younger"
3381440,3386280," and I didn't really understand the dynamics of the stock market right I would I would"
3386280,3393240," see a company post that they earned three point two billion dollars this quarter and boy that"
3393240,3398400," was way off what analysts were expecting so their shares plummeted today and I'm looking"
3398400,3404640," at it going three point four billion seems like a lot of money to me yeah that's I consider"
3404640,3411240," that a win um and so there's this pressure on a company like John Deere to continue ramping"
3411240,3418160," up their revenues but you can only sell so many tractors so they start turning to increasingly"
3418160,3426240," evil schemes to extract more revenue from this finite number of customers right so it's"
3426240,3432360," a systemic problem but that doesn't absolve John Deere of any of the responsibility that"
3432360,3439680," they have to take for participating in it they could just say nope our tractors are our"
3439680,3444120," our user serviceable because that just matters a lot and we're gonna we're gonna build out"
3444120,3448960," uh like a servicing branch uh we'll have a revenue stream from that but we're not going"
3448960,3452480," to hold a gun to our users heads and tell them they absolutely have to use it yeah they"
3452480,3456880," absolutely had that option and their shareholders might not have liked it but at the end of the"
3456880,3460960," day they don't have a ton of competition so they would have been fine maybe just less"
3460960,3466480," fine because the reason that the share price going up matters so much is not actually much"
3466480,3471600," to do with the day-to-day functioning of the company all it really affects is how much you"
3471600,3475480," can borrow essentially and if you're running a profitable business uh there's an argument"
3475480,3479840," to be made that you don't really like the apple doesn't need to borrow money um they have a"
3479840,3485040," ton of cash and if they do borrow money it's only because they are doing so strategically"
3485040,3489760," they it's it's it's cheaper to borrow that money than to to use their own money it all"
3489760,3497360," it's it's all a whole way above my pay grade game that we don't really play here um but if"
3497360,3502640," they're they're a profit oh forget where i was going with this blah blah blah blah right yeah so"
3502640,3506240," it doesn't the share price doesn't actually affect the day-to-day operation of the company but what it"
3506240,3513600," does affect is executive bonuses right so when executives are paid in shares and the share goes"
3513600,3518000," up then they make a lot more money so it basically just comes down to executive greed"
3518000,3526240," yeah someone pointed out to you that they said in the u.s but this is true basically everywhere as"
3526240,3531360," far as my understanding goes farmers have a lot of government subsidies so that they can cheap so"
3531360,3536880," they can keep the prices of groceries at grocery stores down because if they didn't the prices of"
3536880,3543200," groceries at grocery stores would be much higher um so in doing that jon dear doing this hurts all"
3543200,3553920," of us so you should care but yeah that's it uh j.e realize ask didn't lens once say that if a"
3553920,3559200," publicly traded company doesn't make money its shareholders can sue uh it's more if the company"
3559200,3564160," misleads their shareholders and it turns out they weren't doing what they were doing or"
3564160,3570080," if that publicly traded company does not act in the interest of its shareholders jon dear could"
3570080,3578560," easily make the argument that it is in the interest of the long-term um positivity positive sentiment"
3578560,3584320," around their brand that they not engage in these anti-consumer anti-write to repair practices"
3584880,3589040," and they'd be very unlikely even if they could have made an extra 10 million dollars or 100"
3589040,3592640," million dollars this quarter they could have made a strong argument for that it'd be very"
3592640,3600400," difficult to sue them over not screwing their users yeah that's all branding for the lab yeah"
3600400,3608560," we can talk about that um it's uh pretty much settled at this point i think that given the"
3609600,3617600," we as much as we would have loved to use ltt labs um we had some internal concerns about the"
3617600,3623760," close association with ltt we want we want the lab to i mean obviously it's going to be"
3623760,3627600," associated we're going to talk about it all the time we're going to use their numbers we're gonna"
3627600,3632960," we're going to build products and services there that will delight us as much as our users but we"
3632960,3639920," didn't want them to just be tied at the hip uh you know ltt and ltt labs they're just one in the"
3639920,3643760," same because we're still going to do stuff on ltt that has nothing to do with the lab and we're"
3643760,3651360," going to do stuff with labs that has nothing to do with ltt we also as we move away from branding"
3651360,3656640," things with my name uh it's a matter of time before we change the meaning just just retcon"
3656640,3661680," the meaning of linus tech tips change it to like something else tech tips or something and just"
3661680,3665520," change the branding to ltt maybe rebrand entirely i don't know we'll figure that out later"
3665520,3674480," but it we felt it didn't really make much sense to uh to go with ltt labs.com another concern that"
3674480,3682560," we had was that ltt lab.com we do own ltt labs.com so it's very likely we will redirect that so"
3682560,3689280," anytime we talk about the ltt labs or whatever um it'll it'll end up in the right place but ltt lab.com"
3689280,3696640," which would be a very easy typo is a chinese laboratory equipment supplier so i think we would"
3696640,3703200," have and because their page is so slow outside the great firewall i think we could easily end up"
3703200,3708800," with a significant amount of abandonment from people thinking it's ltt lab and just the page"
3708800,3714240," loading really slowly and go for that picture loads it's a black background with orange decks"
3714240,3719040," yeah that doesn't help at all it really looks like pages still not loaded wow"
3719760,3728400," so so it won't be it won't be ltt lab or ltt labs um which meant that we had to try to come up"
3728400,3735600," with a name that was gonna that was going to communicate you know what the the spirit of the lab was"
3735600,3745120," while also being you know easy to type and and and not conflicting with you know any of our any"
3745120,3752080," of our bitter rivals so you know we kicked around some ideas but what we ultimately settled on"
3752080,3756320," is it's going to be gamers command center dot com i i thought"
3756320,3762800," i thought it was only labs what did we settle on"
3762800,3771520," i thought it was only labs dot com because it's only hold on i gotta check the doc i gotta find out"
3771520,3776400," what we actually it's only laboratory stuff uh what domain did we actually acquire"
3776400,3785600," um labs two cents did we did we buy that one hold on i'm trying to bring up the doc here"
3785600,3790400," uh did we actually even acquire the domain yet am i supposed to be talking about this"
3790400,3796880," colton did we get the domain yet live laugh labs no shut up that's not that's not real i know we had"
3796880,3802800," i was posted info we had line of slab dot com i don't think we had tech tech tech lab we got a"
3802800,3809040," a domain but i don't know which one um i thought we were supposed to grab all of these just in case"
3809040,3815280," what about level one labs i see i actually really i really like that name i think i voted for"
3815280,3823440," my memories that we got only labs dot com but i i voted for level one labs yeah lab media group"
3823440,3828960," no i don't think that's right okay labby mik lab face i don't even know what this list is i even"
3828960,3835680," looking at the right list not sure we're just messing with you guys"
3835680,3842320," the number of people that are upset about uh gamers command center"
3842320,3853280," gamers hatchery um so the the current front runner is actually"
3853280,3861680," lab32 dot com yeah and uh the the reason for it is that it's a super short url it's easy to remember"
3861680,3867440," it's really easy and fast to type but branding is very easy uh yeah the branding looks really good"
3867440,3875520," sarah's actually done some some draft branding around it already that looks flippin cool so the"
3875520,3882880," the merch which i will obviously go to supporting the work that we're doing at the lab is"
3882880,3891440," um gonna look really cool which is awesome uh 32 people are asking why 32 and the reason is that"
3891440,3900720," it's it was actually inspired by a conversation around the like executive table uh where colton"
3900720,3905600," was saying something about like system 32 was it you colton who mentioned like system 32"
3905600,3911040," yeah wrecked yeah and uh so the significance of the number 32 is just that it's a number that"
3911040,3917920," comes up it gets busy in computing right um so it's what people are mentioning lab69.com"
3917920,3925840," that did come up yeah it came up obviously that's like stupid yeah i'm gonna do that yeah um"
3926960,3934000," lab64 we also considered but lab 32 just i don't know rolls off the tongue i think i think the"
3934000,3939440," lab 32 is better in my opinion i like it i think it's pretty sick and then when we checked to make"
3939440,3944880," sure that there was nothing conflicting with it right you know no one else is is using this name"
3944880,3951920," or anything like that the only real reference that we could find to it was actually one of the"
3951920,3958160," areas in chrono trigger there's uh there's uh there's a lab 32 and chrono trigger and this"
3958160,3964560," happens to be one of my favorite all-time games and i yeah i just kind of i kind of kind of fell in"
3964560,3970000," love with it don't delete lab 32 yeah i see it's like it's pretty good i think it's good i think it's"
3970000,3977680," solid yeah yeah everything else was just a joke that we brainstormed right before we started the"
3977680,3982240," show to troll you guys yeah we did like a bunch of different youtubers made it sound like they're"
3982240,3990160," things yeah did stuff like that do you guys want some more merch messages oh yeah hit me hit me oh"
3990160,3996480," right this one comes from Ian hey Linus looking forward to get my ltt backpack in the warranty i"
3996480,4001120," won't need to use i'm curious if you've considered making a camera bag variant of the backpack or"
4001120,4006880," maybe a camera insert for the backpack yeah we've looked at making a camera insert um as for a"
4006880,4014000," camera bag variant i'd say that that is not impossible but it's pretty far off the thing about that is"
4014000,4022640," that as not a camera daily carrier i i just have less to contribute i guess i also feel that it's a"
4022640,4028400," more niche market compared to people who carry a laptop so it was a lower priority for us in the"
4028400,4037200," first place um there's no real clear flow to the things i'm saying i'm just brain diarying out of my"
4037200,4043520," mouth everything that we bought about and talked about when we decided on a laptop bag rather than"
4043520,4049040," a camera bag i think that based on community feedback you're more likely to see like a like a"
4049040,4055200," downsized version of the existing laptop bag before you'd see a camera bag from us but that is"
4055840,4059760," nowhere near even beginning development right now so don't hold your breath for it"
4059760,4067120," oh hey we just fired up a poll for our floatplane chat do you guys like the name lab 32 we want"
4067120,4071200," to know what you guys think i think it even just like looks cool like typing it out i was like yeah"
4071200,4076640," that looks pretty good i don't know all right i got another really important question this"
4076640,4081360," this one comes from thomas question for luke and lynus if you can install any game on a john"
4081360,4087680," dear tractor what would it be um minor vga farming simulator i like it fantastic"
4087680,4097760," wow 90 percent of the community is lab 32 is pretty good for a name in my opinion that's basically"
4097760,4104080," it then yeah that's pretty solid yeah especially when you just first present something yeah"
4105040,4112160," i mean we did have some people internally point out that it doesn't really describe"
4112160,4117440," what you do i know like it was compared to something like pc part picker which has a very clear"
4117440,4123680," identity right in the in the url site that one's a good example yeah i i often find like there are"
4123680,4129520," certain websites that have names that are very objective like that that to me sound like bot"
4129520,4135600," sites auto written articles just trying to get your clicks off of google the serve ads just"
4135600,4140480," think that that was my immediate reaction to at least one of the names that was even suggested in"
4140480,4146400," there i don't remember exactly what it was and it was a legit website i knew that because i've"
4146400,4150320," gone to it before but if it just came up as a google search i had never seen it before i would"
4150320,4155360," probably ignore it because it sounds like uh someone grabbed a url that they're like that'll be"
4155360,4162000," really effective yeah and i'm gonna fill it full of like scrape auto auto scraping bot posts that"
4162000,4168160," just try to get as many clicks as possible so i don't know i think a unique name is completely fine"
4168160,4171840," because you don't need the brand recognition for the url for people that have never heard of you"
4171840,4179840," before you can spread that brand recognition yourself and it's fine in my opinion all right next"
4179840,4185360," merge message comes from radioactive twinkie hey liness and luke with the massive size utility"
4185360,4190080," and popularity of steam do either of you feel that there are any other compelling alternatives"
4190080,4196960," or do you think steam is basically in a league of its own at this point epic yep that's it just"
4196960,4202880," epic origin will never actually fully compete uh you you whatever they even call it now you'd be"
4202880,4210240," soft connect will never actually compete um gog is fantastic but it's kind of in it its own"
4210240,4214400," little niche and i think it does really well where it is and i don't think it's ever really going"
4214400,4220160," to truly compete at the scale that steam is that uh but yeah epic absolutely i mean hold on a second"
4220160,4226480," i mean you could make an argument for xbox in the longer term i seriously doubt it they're certainly"
4226480,4231280," building in if they ever actually did successfully acquire discord for example and they started to"
4231280,4237920," integrate uh more community in xbox if they i mean game pass is already a way to just"
4237920,4245760," ensure you always have the problem is the xbox app on desktop is horrible well and the windows store"
4245760,4252560," is horrible yes and it would need to be removed and rebuilt to fix a lot of the problems that they"
4252560,4257200," have yes i don't see that happening yes and they've they've been making all these commitments to"
4257200,4265120," pc gaming while having while trying to force their store which is nowhere near ready to be forced it"
4265120,4270160," feels like the horizon worlds thing from facebook which where it's like you really honestly thought"
4270160,4276000," it was a good idea to let people even use this let alone try to push people to use it um it's"
4276000,4284000," it's really bad the worst thing about uh horizon world whatever horizon worlds three or four whatever"
4284000,4291200," the newest one is um i don't remember uh but the worst thing about it is the fact that microsoft"
4291200,4295200," deals with all the multiplayer stuff and you have to do it through the store it makes it so that"
4295200,4300080," multiplayer is basically useless and you should just play the game as a single player game and that"
4300080,4306800," sucks that is super rough the the most brutal things about playing halo is the fact that microsoft"
4306800,4312320," runs the multiplayer and the friendless things are all super weird and all this other kind of stuff"
4312320,4320640," and it just sucks and i don't see those things being solved because i think as much as um"
4320640,4326160," the new leadership there have gotten rid of some of their old rules about not competing with each"
4326160,4330560," other and always building their own things and stuff like that i think some of those ideas are still"
4330560,4336160," um hard set at microsoft and they are going to only use their own things and they're going to"
4336160,4340480," only do this other type of stuff and they are not going to invest enough in it to do a good enough"
4340480,4345520," job so it will always be bad that is my opinion hopefully i'm wrong but that's it"
4345520,4350400," all right i got another one that kind of plays into what you guys are working on right now this"
4350400,4355600," one comes from zakri hey lianice and luke how about doing the all the domains i own segment"
4355600,4360480," uh you had the idea for a few months back it'd be cool to hear the stories behind all the random"
4360480,4370080," domains you have bought wow uh yeah i'd love to i actually don't think i have the login for our"
4370080,4377360," you don't have all the domain registrar uh multiple ones now too oh well think think about like"
4377360,4384720," i don't actually want to necessarily go do it but yeah um we would definitely have to"
4384720,4392640," prepare for that ahead of time we could do it though because i don't think that particular uh"
4392640,4401040," 2fa is even on like our our our accessible 2fa device i think it's on like an air-gapped 2fa"
4401040,4408560," device you don't you do not fuck around with your domain registrar account so uh yeah that's"
4408560,4412880," something we'd have to prep ahead of the show yeah i think evan might be the only one who has"
4412880,4422160," access to everything nope no oh all right then there you go i don't think anyone does oh um is that"
4422160,4427200," a problem okay well we'll have to have a conversation about that later not really but okay hopefully"
4427200,4431280," it's all good there's more than one as far as my understanding goes although i don't know about"
4431280,4438800," one of them there's more than one person that has access access to each okay okay okay i can i"
4438800,4444160," i own boring math lessons dot com sounds pretty good adequate video service we own adequate video"
4444160,4449520," service dot com yeah blip blip bloop dot com i think we might have gotten rid of a while back but that"
4449520,4455120," was one of the proposed names for float plane yeah are you serious or something like that yeah"
4455120,4460000," it's something like there were not a lot of dot coms that's one of the genuine problems like we"
4460000,4467120," were talking about logos earlier but like dot coms it's an issue like you can't just come up with"
4467120,4471200," things anymore because people park them and then want to sell them to you for tens of thousands of"
4471200,4476160," dollars if not hundreds some of this stuff i might not have anymore but i definitely owned um"
4477600,4483280," just of it dot com and the idea was that it was like instant news updates with like camera phone"
4483280,4492800," it was like basically uh like youtube stories essentially um or like shorts uh how the f"
4492800,4500800," uh makeup for bros was a dot com that i owned at one point i don't think i have it anymore because"
4500800,4506000," i was like i'm never gonna do anything with this um but these were just uh you know the makeup for"
4506000,4512320," bros one was just identifying that makeup for men was becoming much more of a thing this is like"
4512320,4519360," ten years ago and you know kind of figuring out what uh verticals other than tech we could start"
4519360,4528560," to establish a presence and but yeah we just never never never got on it all right this one comes"
4528560,4535040," from john line us do you think framework might implement a refurbished program or owner marketplace"
4535040,4539280," would you advocate for it it'd be cool to offer my used hardware to other framework owners"
4539280,4547440," um sorry i tuned up for a second one's like all right no worries you want me to read it again"
4547440,4554080," nope okay um oh wait no that's a different one i thought i thought i had found it already"
4554080,4561200," implement a refurb program or owner marketplace i don't think it's necessary it's called ebay"
4561200,4566640," like i just you're reinventing a wheel that already rolls pretty well in its own i'd say that is i'd"
4566640,4573360," say that's not necessary a pro move though by the way buying a ten dollar gift card to send a merch"
4573360,4578240," message if there isn't something that you're necessarily you know eyeing this week but there's"
4578240,4582480," might be something coming soon and you want to send a merch message that is a way to do it and it"
4582480,4585040," doesn't cost anything for shipping because we don't actually ship them they're digital"
4587760,4593040," all right this one comes from karthik we need a project farm style screwdriver comparison"
4593040,4597360," vid at the very least tell me if it's worth a worthy upgrade over the client tools driver"
4597360,4603840," i think you should just wait for project farm to cover it because i mean look i'm not going to put"
4603840,4608640," words in their mouth you know if they don't want to cover it then fine you know you don't have to"
4608640,4614400," right but i think that it would i think that that piece of content would perform well and we'd be"
4614400,4618800," more than happy to send one over i think project farm buys the tools though i don't think they"
4618800,4624640," accept samples so we'd be more than happy to make one available for purchase um but yeah there's no"
4624640,4628720," need for us to make a project farm video when project farm can make a project farm video that's"
4628720,4638880," my take on that project farm is a youtube channel for those of you who haven't heard a project farm"
4638880,4644160," are we talking about screwdriver soon should we talk about it now oh do it yeah we we"
4644160,4653040," should right we're going to do a pop up yeah um the date is set ish um it'll be august 27th"
4653040,4660480," it's going to be at the lab from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m so that's august 27th 10 a.m. to 2 p.m."
4660480,4666480," pacific time we're going to have around 2,500 screwdrivers so we are giving you guys a little"
4666480,4673600," bit more notice this time i'm not going to lie to you again i will be there but the point of being"
4673600,4679200," there i'm not going to be wandering around outside the point of coming is to buy a screwdriver so don't"
4679200,4683760," just come and hang around there isn't enough parking for that are we still planning on doing the stream"
4683760,4689440," yeah yeah so that's probably what i'll be focusing on yeah so we're we're going to have a stream where"
4689440,4695120," people are going to be able to try the screwdriver these are all actually final everything in here"
4695120,4701760," is final hardware if you want to check them out that's it that's well you can just take one if you"
4701760,4709520," want greedy you have right these are final hardware though so these will be there at the pop-up shop"
4709520,4715120," they will be available for purchase we'll have 2,500 of them we are going to have competing drivers"
4715120,4720000," they're in person oh we're going to have some scrap parts from free geek if you want to like"
4720000,4726240," you know screw motherboard into a case or whatever we're going to have some wood and screws you know"
4726240,4732400," if you just want to screw things in unscrew things yeah try out the ratchet make sure it doesn't"
4732400,4738800," slip make sure it's to your satisfaction um yeah we're we're oh yeah we'll have comparison"
4738800,4744560," i already say we'll have comparison drivers oh i'm not sure so vira, client, snap-on, we're going to"
4744560,4751280," have comparison drivers from all the the major major tool manufacturers for for ratcheting drivers"
4752640,4757760," and i'm yeah that's just because i'm extremely confident and then like luke mentioned we're"
4757760,4761920," gonna have a live stream so people are going to be able to compare the drivers talk about it to the"
4761920,4766080," live stream i think we're gonna stream on short circuit i'm not sure if we've actually settled on"
4766080,4771360," where exactly the stream is going to go correct on short circuit all i know it's on flow plane"
4771360,4776160," i believe it will be silver version only at the pop-up don't quote me on that though"
4776160,4780960," some people are asking if you can get backpacks or potentially other things i don't think we'll"
4780960,4787920," have any backpacks will we have any backpacks i doubt it because of the shipment waves also it is the"
4787920,4796560," silver version that'll be at the pop-up i know that uh i need to check something okay he's checking"
4796560,4802080," so when said i have a father's day gift now that is correct i'm never giving this back"
4802080,4804320," i'm kidding"
4805040,4813440," i don't know what this is"
4813440,4820480," hello hello you're on the show you're on speaker on the wancho"
4820480,4827840," um we just wanted to know if people are going to be able to buy backpacks at the screwdriver pop-up"
4827840,4833280," yeah remember we uh said we were going to leave the ones that were airshiped in off the side and"
4833280,4838880," then there's gonna be some that it's probably like a hundred-ish okay so we do have a handful"
4838880,4842640," yeah yeah we said the ones that we shipped in"
4842640,4848960," yeah for the back pop-up um i didn't sell that one aside for the screwdriver got it all right thank you"
4848960,4854880," some other stuff too we'll have other stuff oh cool probably we're probably"
4854880,4859280," we're probably something that we next week that just shows like what we'll have and what the pricing"
4859280,4865120," will be and all that stuff just so people not oh okay okay all right thank you"
4865120,4872080," goodbye well there you have it guys from the man himself there will be stoves things will be"
4872080,4880320," had things will be there finally happening man it was good yeah i had previously i had tried"
4880320,4886160," one of the like i don't know what it would be the failed qc ones yeah yeah and like the"
4887040,4891520," actually turning it felt good but switching the rash it didn't feel very good and then that one"
4891520,4896880," was one of the final ones and that that felt that felt very crisp yep that took a lot of work"
4896880,4907280," i bet nice so yeah august 27th be there or b square or like or don't be there like we don't we don't"
4907280,4913360," want like five thousand people to show up last then one is to to turn people away also if you for"
4913360,4918080," whatever reason guys we're we're gonna do ltx next year so don't like get on a plane for this"
4918080,4925520," but if for whatever reason you insist on doing that um there's nothing i can do to stop you but i"
4925520,4930880," will say don't book your flight now because we're pretty sure we're gonna do it on that day but"
4930880,4938480," it's not a hundred percent sure we got the first thousand ratchets today and we've gone through 250"
4938480,4945440," of them i think now to make sure that it's actually they're they're good and they are but the other"
4945440,4950080," ratchets who knows they might get stuck in customs and we might delay it so that we're not we don't"
4950080,4954320," only have a thousand so that we actually have the full 2,500 or you know whatever right like things"
4954320,4958800," can still happen but that's what we are planning on and it is pretty solid at this point that it'll"
4958800,4968400," be on august 27th just not a guarantee all right next merge message i'm gonna ban"
4968400,4977200," the word all right next this one comes so is already banned so next merge message all right"
4977200,4987280," so all right basically just the um um okay i'll stop anonymous it says keep up the good work"
4987280,4993040," particularly love all the new house content is there plans for more home servers smart home home"
4993040,4998080," automation content in the future i feel like the lab could test c-wave zig b Wi-Fi stuff there will"
4998080,5005280," be more home automation stuff in the future because i am almost certainly going to replace my light"
5005280,5011280," switches at this point not because jasco is like a consumer unfriendly company but because i bought"
5011280,5020080," a six-year-old platform and i am not that pleased with the features and performance so um while we"
5020080,5025440," did have that little miscommunication within a valley where they kind of went ahead and called"
5025440,5032800," their switch project linus and slapped my logo on it without consulting me overall i do like their"
5032800,5038480," jam i think they seem like pretty cool folks and they are all meant ready making progress on their"
5038480,5044640," motion sensor integrated switch using millimeter wave technology i'm pretty excited about it so"
5044640,5050160," what i would like is to work with them on that and swap out my jasco switches for those but nothing"
5050160,5056640," is set in stone at this time um other than that i definitely need to figure out the audio setup"
5056640,5061520," we've got all the speakers installed but nothing actually powering them yet i have what else is"
5061520,5068240," going on oh someone else here david s mentioned the sofa baton x1 i have not opened the box yet i"
5068240,5072480," definitely do need to do that um checking i want to check it out as a replacement for the logitech"
5072480,5080000," harmony so there's lots and lots and lots more stuff lots more stuff to talk about all right"
5080480,5085360," i just said all right again i'm gonna start all right all right all right"
5085360,5090480," linus with all the upgrades you made to your old house brackets tech and otherwise what are you"
5090480,5096400," planning on leaving behind for the new owners other than wiring in the walls nothing right like"
5096400,5103520," you wouldn't leave um do you leave the server rack i don't think so mr eggs i'm i'm a thousand"
5103520,5109520," years away from thinking about moving out of that house though so it's it's pretty tough"
5109520,5113360," they're talking about your old one oh the old one i'm pretty sure oh i thought we were talking"
5113360,5119600," about the new one sorry i i i spaced i think i think they're talking about uh your old one oh"
5119600,5126240," well there wasn't really much there like there was like networking in the walls and"
5126240,5130240," like speaker insulate speakers you're not going to take the aco yeah like anything that's fixed to"
5130240,5135200," the house you wouldn't really remove so everything everything i did is still there yeah perfect next"
5135200,5139600," one comes from nathan hey linus did your time as a product manager affect the way that you look"
5139600,5145840," at your own store and or what are some of your biggest takeaways from that time absolutely i mean"
5145840,5153120," everything i learned about detail i learned at ncix both what to do and what not to do um that was"
5153120,5159920," my first real job actually out of school and i had some really good mentors there i also had some"
5159920,5167680," less stellar mentorship uh like i said i learned what to do and what not to do but there's there's a"
5167680,5171760," ton of there's a ton of principles that we follow that are absolutely based on on what i learned"
5171760,5177520," there i mean one of the big ones is take care of your customers because angry customers man the"
5177520,5183120," number the number of people that i feel like thought that we would be willing to tarnish our"
5183120,5189680," reputation over like 250 bucks over a replacement backpack was just kind of baffling to me"
5189680,5195680," i don't want to sound out of touch but in the context of the scale of this operation i don't"
5195680,5202000," think that was the point i can't believe we're getting back on this topic we're not okay but in"
5202000,5206320," the context of the scale of this operation in the context of the damage that it could do to our"
5206320,5213360," brand 250 is nothing right that's not why people are mad though i think people are mad for a variety"
5213360,5220880," of reasons some valid and some less so okay so we can leave it at that but um yeah i saw time and"
5220880,5229120," time again NCIX just shoot themselves in the foot over very very small sums of money they would you"
5229120,5236720," know they would in a situation where it just totally doesn't make sense and is just detrimental"
5236720,5242960," to the customer they would they would enforce policies that just you know didn't matter right"
5242960,5247760," like you'd have someone bring in a motherboard that they clearly opened right like a hundred"
5247760,5254320," and fifty dollar motherboard let's say and they opened it and you know and see it's totally still"
5254320,5258720," working it's like brand new they just opened it and it was an ATX motherboard and they had an"
5258720,5266080," MATX case right so they bring it back because it doesn't work for them and NCIX you know rep be"
5266080,5272240," like sorry 15% restocking fee and it's like hey um particularly at that time motherboard"
5272240,5277920," packaging didn't even seal yeah it's a brand new board you're i know that you're going to just"
5277920,5283840," resell it as new anyway so we're talking about if there if there was a seal and there often wasn't"
5283840,5289040," it was just the tape on the bag on the inside oh that is open up in the first place anyway to"
5289040,5292720," put their own label on them so they would break the seals on the products in the first place"
5292720,5297920," so we're talking about 22 dollars on a product that you're going to resell at full price anyway"
5298800,5302640," and a totally innocent mistake the guy's not trying to rip you off"
5302640,5307360," like i just i just i watched mistakes like that made that's going to drive a customer to another"
5307360,5313440," store for sure yeah over what 22 dollars because it's the the the biggest thing is the like principle"
5313440,5319200," and the annoyance of that being charged at all when you're like trying to come back and trying to"
5319200,5325520," continue being a customer yeah it's just it was it was just frustrating like it's just common sense"
5325520,5333200," to me don't do that it's not worth it you know and then as expected that person would post on"
5333200,5338880," the forum and then and then we'd have to give them the full refund and a gift card to make them shut"
5338880,5349120," up it's like wow good job you just cost you just played yourself oh my goodness all right next"
5349120,5353360," one comes from Harrison hey Linus and Luke when hiring new employees you look for people with a"
5353360,5357600," lot of experience or would you consider hiring employees who may not have as much experience"
5357600,5363360," but want to learn a lot while at LTT or whatever company that's going to get a big fat it depends"
5363360,5370400," there's some roles where we can afford to kind of train on job and there's other roles where we"
5370400,5375680," can't there's some roles where we're we're doing something new or something different and we need"
5375680,5380880," someone to come in and be an experienced leader so that we can hire other people that can train"
5380880,5385680," under them yeah like Gary for example yes was someone that we hired we're gonna need someone"
5385680,5391120," with experience for that role yeah and it's been great because I don't have to micromanage him"
5391120,5397280," like he'll just go and do stuff and then I'll have a meeting with them like once every week or a"
5397280,5401200," couple of weeks and it's like yeah what are you working on it's like oh yeah that's all stuff that"
5401200,5407040," makes sense that's what I would have told you to do if I sat and fought really hard and came up with"
5407040,5412640," a really great plan that's what I would have told you to do so see you later you know yeah love"
5412640,5416720," having people like that but sometimes you need that sometimes you need other people that you can"
5416720,5422000," kind of mold and yeah or or you're hiring for a role that doesn't really exist like back when we"
5422000,5427520," hired Nick Light yeah how many experienced youtuber sales representatives were there"
5427520,5434640," well for real I mean no like even poach from because you you had started it but like"
5435920,5440640," even the ad formats that we had we're like not even really a thing at that point in time on youtube"
5440640,5444320," like that's how old school the channel is so yeah that totally makes sense"
5444320,5451760," um yeah so there is there's a really big range um I really like portfolios I don't necessarily"
5451760,5459040," like if you can prove to me that you can do the job it depends on the role again because like Gary's"
5459040,5463280," role would need experience no matter what but like from a development standpoint if you can prove to"
5463280,5469600," me that you can make fantastic things and you're like code's open source so I can see it and I can"
5469600,5473200," see the way that you develop I can see the way that you document I can see all these different"
5473200,5479760," types of things what do I care about the education or experience um you can do a fantastic job so"
5479760,5483600," it sounds good yeah hiring for a lot of the sales roles for the Linus Media Group side has been"
5483600,5488800," interesting because it's not just like we're selling things right like you it's it's completely"
5488800,5493840," different right if somebody's coming from the used car sales market and they apply here to work as"
5493840,5499120," an account lead and they want to sell sponsorships it's not the same yeah thing yeah so we'll have"
5499120,5503760," to mold it a fair bit yep a little ink asks do stores still have restocking fees I return"
5503760,5507440," products every now and then I never had to pay something like that I'm from the Netherlands"
5507440,5516400," uh this is a great example of rolling down a hill um many IT brands have restocking fees so in the"
5516400,5522960," event that NCIX especially back then were to return that product to their supplier they're"
5522960,5530000," basically just passing the savings on to you but in reverse someone asked if we do code interviews"
5530000,5538240," I have found that a lot of the developers that apply um due to the way that we send out the"
5538240,5544320," fact that we have a job coming in are often fans of the channel um I I would also wager to say that"
5544320,5549040," people that follow uh like software development software engineering blah blah blah those types"
5549040,5560320," of roles are not always the the most like socially experienced um so they're often very high nerves"
5560320,5566880," in interviews when people are interviewing with us so I don't see a huge amount of value in testing"
5566880,5572480," people live in that type of situation what we tend to do is we try to give them a take home that we"
5572480,5579280," hope will take a reasonable amount of time um and we try to frame it in a way that um like if you"
5579280,5584880," were just posting on Stack Overflow we would know uh and it's not going to be like super generic"
5584880,5588000," answers so that we can actually see how people would do things and we can see how they would"
5588000,5595520," comment and stuff like that um that's that's our approach oh we should jump into uh another"
5595520,5602240," news topic the California DMV accuses Tesla of making misleading claims about autopilot"
5602240,5611200," what this is hilarious how many times have I called this oh like how many times honestly yeah"
5611200,5615920," I'm actually surprised be ridiculous I actually am surprised that it took this long"
5615920,5620160," I'm shocked it took this more more than anything it's just the amount of time that it took yeah"
5620160,5624320," that's that's stunning I for a second I thought you were like making up the headline because of"
5624320,5630960," how many times that you said Tesla is under fire from the California DMV for untrue or misleading"
5630960,5637040," claims about autopilot and full self-driving the main things the DMV has a problem with are the"
5637040,5642960," terms and wording that Tesla uses saying autopilot and full self-driving are terms that do not"
5642960,5652960," represent the capabilities of the system no no there's no way that happened the use of the words"
5652960,5657360," full self-driving capabilities on their website particularly the words the system is designed"
5657360,5661600," to be able to conduct short and long distance trips with no action required by the person in"
5661600,5666560," the driver's seat um yeah yeah that's pretty misrepresentative according to the DMV the way"
5666560,5670560," Tesla advertises their systems oh okay this is sort of redundant but that's fine"
5670560,5677760," although Tesla does have disclaimers on their website the DMV says that these only contradict"
5677760,5684000," the advertising instead of carrying the violation yeah that makes sense um DMV seeks to require"
5684000,5688640," Tesla to provide more accurate terms and descriptions and more and better consumer education of the"
5688640,5693600," product capabilities and limitations is what the DMV said in a statement to market watch"
5693600,5706160," yeah good yeah this should have happened many many years ago yeah back when Tesla's autopilot"
5706160,5714000," and full self-driving whatever was even less capable than it is now the number of I mean I don't have"
5714000,5718960," to tell you guys the number of times we've seen people asleep at the wheel and their Teslas is"
5718960,5725200," uh utterly unacceptable and it yes okay it's supposed to like get you to not do that and it"
5725200,5729760," communicates that you shouldn't do that and stuff like that but if you tell someone that something"
5729760,5735440," can do if you tell someone that this machine has a certain capability they're going to bypass"
5735440,5739280," that type of stuff at any possible opportunity everyone people are shoving oranges and they're"
5739280,5743520," stealing steering wheels because it was like detecting it as a hand or whatever like people"
5743520,5748240," are going to do people are going to get away get around sorry those types of limitations um"

5754320,5759280," driving existence yep but in practice it feels like handing your keys over to a teenager that's"
5759280,5763920," texting and driving in my opinion they shouldn't call it self-driving till it actually is right now"
5763920,5769840," it's just really good driving assistance um I find Tesla in particular kind of terrifying given"
5769840,5774640," that they push out beta self-driving features to be tested on public roads and there's no hacking"
5774640,5778640," way I'm trusting a car to drive me until it has been proven reliable and much better than the"
5778640,5783840," average driver for years and that's fair enough which again is all like yeah as far as my understanding"
5783840,5788560," goes they they have the best self-driving and that's that's great and that's fantastic and they should"
5788560,5794000," they should be proud and happy about that um but yeah it shouldn't it shouldn't be uh falsely"
5794000,5800240," advertised that's all which is true about like everything so yeah not just not just related to"
5800240,5804880," this yeah floatplane chats talking about when red bull got sued for it not actually giving you"
5804880,5810640," wings yeah I mean if that went through a little yeah there's no way Tesla should be calling their"
5810640,5816320," cars full self-driving or autopilot yeah because sometimes with stuff like the red bull thing uh"
5816320,5820640," because I think there was a Skittles one too back then at around the same time"
5820640,5824560," Skittles said something in their advertisement but it wasn't like as interesting as gives you wings"
5824560,5829200," oh I don't remember um but I I think there was yeah I think there was a few of them back then but"
5829200,5835280," like in those types of situations it's like well yeah obviously not but in this situation it's not"
5835280,5841360," an obviously not which makes it way worse in my opinion funny hat says any pilot will tell you"
5841360,5845360," autopilot will get you killed really quickly in an airplane with thousands of feet of space around"
5845360,5853200," you clear well okay so maybe maybe autopilot is is somewhat defensible but the full self-driving"
5853200,5860640," nonsense needs to go obviously and the average user the average Joe public interpretation of the"
5860640,5868800," word autopilot is more inspired by science fiction films yeah then it's inspired by actual airplane"

6280800,6285440," very unlikely I think that's beyond the scope of how they're going to they're going to evaluate"
6285440,6290000," products as they're intended to be used but I could absolutely see them you you archived that"
6290000,6296400," one already I was gonna look back at the wording repairability yeah but absolutely repairability"
6296400,6302080," would be a major consideration for us when evaluating a product with that said we're not looking to"
6302080,6308880," replace I fix it they already do a great job of providing repairability scores for key key new"
6308880,6314400," devices it's just something that we would consider as we go through and evaluate it as it's intended"

6337360,6342240," I've encountered some snake well there mics and interfaces will come they're a relatively low"
6342240,6346160," priority category because they're a relatively low volume category compared to something like"
6346160,6353120," CPUs or GPUs I don't believe it tests XLR or TRS cables but that is something that we will be"
6353120,6357280," building out the capability to test in the future because we are planning to develop our own line"
6357280,6364560," of cables and we won't settle for anything other than the best beauty this is ridiculous what do"
6364560,6369680," you mean flex time is just to keep you from actually taking time off people use their flex time all"
6369680,6378080," the time here if that was the point of it it is not working hold on oh wait I think they're talking"
6378080,6384560," about a different system oh ours is paid so it's basically vacation time and you yeah you like take"
6384560,6391760," it as it as it fit is vacation time I think they're interpreting being able to have flexible hours"
6391760,6397120," oh oh no no no and be able to like shift your hours oh no flex time is just a policy that we"
6397120,6403760," introduced back when the covid lockdowns were starting to become more of a thing where on top"
6403760,6410640," of the legally mandated vacation time we added two weeks of paid time that is not strictly speaking"
6410640,6415120," vacation is it two weeks two weeks i thought i was on week i don't know is it a week i don't know"
6415120,6420160," colton help uh two weeks okay cool yeah two weeks is that right yeah it's two weeks i feel like i'm"
6420160,6425680," saying it wrong okay yeah yeah so everyone has two weeks of additional paid time off on top of their"
6425680,6429120," vacation time and we call it flex time because you don't have to do it because after your first year"
6429120,6435280," i believe okay uh so you don't have to book it ahead of time is actually this do anyways i'm not"
6435280,6441520," so sure okay we'll check i'm often not the best at being on top of those types of things though so"
6441520,6445920," maybe you guys are right okay people use it all the time this sounds like a lot of time"
6445920,6450880," on top of vacation time yeah it is it's like really inconvenient to schedule around yeah yeah"
6450880,6455360," but but like to be clear we care about people having good work life balance oh that's cool um it's"
6455360,6460640," just from a from a scheduling standpoint it does have downsides sitting there having only used a week"
6460640,6467600," yeah i i mean i haven't used that much but yeah i've used some of it though like i yeah i totally have"
6467600,6473600," i've had stuff happen like it's it's really nice to because there's always the kind of dreaded"
6473600,6477360," feeling like if something really negative in your life happens and you're like okay i need to take"
6477360,6481680," some time off to deal with this it's like i have to dip into my vacation time to deal with this"
6481680,6485920," thing that is just like horrible and doesn't feel like a vacation it's kind of nice to be like no"
6486480,6491440," my vacation time is fine it will stay there i will use flex time i think it's cool i'm totally"
6491440,6496960," done this merch message comes from door line us you always mention not consuming long form content"
6496960,6502880," is it just time constraint or you don't really connect to the format uh it's it's mostly that i"
6502880,6510240," just get anxiety when i look at a long run time on something and i'm just like oh i should probably"
6510240,6515760," be doing something else uh i'll go do some nails so that's one of the main reasons i'll like"
6515760,6523040," never start a new tv show because it's like a you know 15 25 hour commitment in a lot of cases"
6523040,6527440," especially if it's an established show that's been running for a long time or are already concluded"
6527440,6533920," and it's just a huge time commitment no no it's not that i don't connect to the format it's just that"
6533920,6540240," a time and b attention span like i would never sit and watch an entire TED talk i just"
6542560,6549680," there's there's no way i could unless it unless it was very relevant to my interests like it was"
6549680,6555360," stuff i must know i could i could think of a couple but like it's i've sat through long presentations"
6555360,6564560," i'm fully capable of it but it better be relevant yeah"
6564560,6572320," uh sure yeah some of these are not very good colton but that's okay you do great"
6572320,6575360," um okay so"
6575360,6581200," hey uh cm says thanks for getting me through some tough times to luke"
6581200,6587120," hey look probably and that would you start doing more content about cool projects involving"
6587120,6592320," computer vision now that you have a cv dev in the lab i think you're going to see us using our dev"
6592320,6597600," as opposed to just making content about computer vision but in the long term who knows jackson"
6597600,6601600," i've recently started a video production business after freelancing for a while and it has"
6602240,6606480," whoo k people are sending a bunch of them now and it has been tough navigating the business part"
6606480,6612160," did you have help with the business part sure did uh evan helped me a lot i have an uncle who gave me"
6612160,6615200," some some pretty good advice at the beginning um"
6615200,6624560," yes i did i did get help but i also spent you know the previous six years or whatever it was in a"
6624560,6631120," fast-paced business environment at ncix where i learned a lot scrap metal love the show i was"
6631120,6635280," curious if you guys would be open to making a video about a budget server slash networking"
6635280,6643760," rack setup get the lac rack it's all about the lac rack the ikea lac oh yeah i've heard of this"
6643760,6649120," yeah yeah you can just convert it to the the standard spacing for rack mount equipment super"
6649120,6655120," cheap yeah that's what like as far as i can tell it's what basically everyone does yeah step on step"
6655120,6662080," on i believe firmly in the benefits of video games my sister does not what kind of system or games"
6662080,6666880," could i use to convince her to let me buy my nisa console next year when she is old enough"
6666880,6678560," interesting so step number one um respect the wishes of the parents yeah do not blind side your"
6678560,6683120," your sister sister yeah do not blindside your sister with the gift it sounds like you're already"
6683120,6689360," you already understand that and what you'd like to do is convince your sister um i would bring up"
6689360,6694960," games that the family can play together i would bring up the that parental controls exist so you"
6694960,6698640," can limit the amount of time that can be spent because there might be a concern where like you"
6698640,6701840," can enforce the amount of time they can spend while they're home but if they leave or they just"
6701840,6708640," gonna spend all day on it i'd say the i'd say the um the the creative and learning benefits of"
6708640,6715280," something like a minecraft vastly outweigh the drawbacks of the screen time boogie man um"
6715280,6722480," but you might not convince her yeah i'd be specific about the games that i would suggest"
6722480,6726560," though and don't just get whatever because yeah like minecraft is very cool for that there's a lot"
6726560,6731680," of other games that are in that type of style where like it's a lot of uh brainpower and thought"
6731680,6742240," process which is good and creativity and whatnot for luke floatplane is missing some quality of"
6742240,6746960," life features compared to something like youtube yeah floatplane also has a development budget"
6746960,6752160," literally like multiple orders of magnitude smaller than youtube but yes there's two though my question"
6752160,6756720," is what is your motivation to add these features as it will increase usage and raise operating costs"
6756720,6762400," instead of having supporters still use youtube uh floatplane is less about the features and more"
6762400,6768560," about supporting us and the content content is king floatplane has really really good exclusives"
6768560,6775440," right now uh behind the scenes um like meet the team uh cutting room floor stuff there's a there's"
6775440,6779680," a lot of really good stuff on floatplane right now more than ever before you notice we're pushing"
6779680,6784080," it really hard in the videos lately that's not because you know luke's team finally got their"
6784080,6790000," butts and gear and made a decent platform they had already done that uh the hard work um it's that"
6790000,6797360," we finally got around to building out a team that is dedicated to uploading creative fun content"
6797360,6801760," over there really good stuff up to make it worthwhile i would also mention about features this this"
6801760,6808640," year in particular has been really tough for floatplane due to some um staffing issues and i i think"
6808640,6814960," when the term staffing issues gets used these days it's describing something that is not what i'm"
6814960,6820960," describing yeah just under hiring in the first place uh well i hear it used for that a lot well"
6820960,6826720," that's floatplane definitely had that um okay yes the team was always smaller than the uh"
6826720,6831680," our uh what do you what do you call it that wasn't the issue this year though uh yeah i've been"
6831680,6837280," hiring like the entire year but the floatplane team hasn't grown at all um haven't no not yet i"
6837280,6841360," don't know oh that's what it will be yeah but yeah not not quite yet but yeah we had some other"
6841360,6847280," staffing issues more related to people being unable to work for personal reasons but they were"
6847280,6852240," going to come back and they have come back and we're very happy that they've come back um and those"
6852240,6860160," staffing issues are solved slash still being solved because hiring takes a long time um and there are"
6860160,6864000," more quality of life features coming down the pipeline we heard a lot of people talking about the"
6864560,6869520," um wanting to be able to see where they had left off in a video thing so that's coming uh there's"
6869520,6875120," lots of other stuff coming yeah mike d says thanks for the tip on the gift card line this quick question"
6875120,6879680," why do you always joke about firing colton he seems like a hardworking and valuable employee"
6879680,6884560," colton uh you know that i can tell when you send your own merge messages right uh"
6884560,6889200," all right i told you i told you if you do that again it's the end"
6891200,6898560," i'll see you later uh what how did it get oh yeah we started joking about firing okay so first of"
6898560,6904800," all i used to fire luke all the time i don't remember how that started maybe because i"
6904800,6908720," maybe because i hadn't even hired you because you worked at ncix like i don't know it would have"
6908720,6913600," been something like that like just not sure just a silly thing i know we did it all the time on"
6913600,6921440," wancho it was mostly a wancho specific yeah yeah and then firing luke all the time"

7003040,7007440," if we should try to figure something out moving forward i thought just some other people internally"
7007440,7013600," about this but like figuring out a certain amount per year or like something yeah it's gotten to the"
7013600,7017840," point where it's kind of unmanageable because it's a lot of people if we were to give a backpack to"
7017840,7026640," everyone that's like literally five figures of money it's like a a person yeah it's like hiring"
7026640,7032640," a person for that yeah so so we we do have to figure out um yeah i guess we've got to figure"
