0,8900," Welcome to the wancho you know we've had a concept for a while when show after hours where things get unhinged things get crazy."
8900,14700," We're just gonna start there today because we have had a week."
14700,25800," Each of us has had a day our poor wonderful guests today have had some time and definitely had a day."
26300,32300," We will get to that in a moment but before we do I'm so sorry you guys were waiting for two hours for the show to start."
32300,44300," We've got a lot of great topics to discuss with you guys today first and foremost being that we do actually have some additional updates on the hacking."
44300,52300," Also Amazon has shoddered DP reviews and that's it."
52500,62900," Those are our special guests oh my god I didn't check how to pronounce your name so I'm going to say Chris Nichols and Jordan Drake and I'm going to hope that that's right."
62900,63400," Nice."
63400,66500," What else we got Luke."
66500,71100," Nothing we're going to talk about nothing after that."
71100,79500," No the Swiss Department of Defense cites the Wancho in an argument which is so sick."
81400,84500," That's actually amazing and Linus and I are going to fight."
84500,86000," Oh sorry."
86000,89900," Actually no sorry that topic was already announced by Linus but we'll discuss that later."
89900,95900," Head of Intel arc leaves to form an AI startup because of course he did."
95900,103900," I have to confess in the chaos of this weekend today I have not even glanced at the dark."
103900,106200," Let's do this thing."
106200,127200," [Music]"
127200,132700," The show is brought to you today by Goliath Technologies the Ridge and Squarespace."
133700,151200," Okay you know what what are we doing first I would lead with the updates on the hacking and just right the discussion but our poor poor guests have waited so long to talk about a site that they no longer even get to work for."
151200,152700," I am."
152700,159700," I want to have lots of energy as I introduce Chris and Jordan but I'm actually really sad."
160700,168700," Can I just do can I do like a quick read of our of our Wancho writers sort of bullet points here don't know you can they can they can leave them up leave them up."
168700,189700," But then I want to kind of I want to kind of get into it with you guys like what what is going on with you what is going on with you know everyone else but first okay this week it was revealed that one of the casualties of Amazon's layoffs was the highly respected and sure we're editorializing a little bit here we're saying."
190200,203200," You know highly respected colorful language but but that that's how I feel okay highly respected digital photography review DP review which I thought was a very different site the first time I heard of it."
204200,226200," They're the world's most popular source for camera reviews and they will be shutting down after 25 years in operation users who have uploaded photos to the site will have until April 6 to download them and after April 10 the site will cease to update Amazon gave no reason publicly for the DP reviews closure."
226200,237200," We reached out to DP reviews editor in chief, Jordan Schneider and there doesn't appear to be any official plan to archive the site for preservation which is deeply saddening."
237200,245200," There's an unofficial effort by the archive by archive team to scrape the entire site and make it available via the Internet archive."
246200,263200," I have a quote here from Jordan Schneider Jordan excuse me, Jordan Schneider I'm extremely sleep deprived I apologize for everything I'm about to do it anyway this is a quote losing DP review marks a particularly dark day for photography enthusiasts."
263200,274200," Then okay I'm going to jump in here I'm sorry Jordan you're doing a great job of talking about how sad this is but it's even sadder this is a dark day for journalism like this sucks."
274200,287200," Okay so I'm going back to I'm going back to his thing DP review was among the first organizations to go to a fully online format and they created some of the most comprehensive technical reviews and deep dives that have ever been made on the subject of digital photography."
287200,299200," It's one thing to lose the team and no longer have that level of quality on new cameras and equipment. It's in another entirely arguably worse situation to hear that the historical information on the site will just disappear."
299200,306200," Deep view isn't just a publication it's so old and comprehensive it's basically a digital library library should never close."
306200,322200," Yeah this sucks it is unclear at this time what will happen to the sites associated YouTube channel though it's longtime hosts Chris and Jordan you can see here have been picked up by petapixel and independent media organization that specializes in photography."
322200,335200," So with all of that said I want you guys to just kind of walk me through first of all why the f*** does Amazon own DP review at all."
335200,338200," I didn't know that surprising."
338200,341200," Yeah so so first off before we get started everybody's tired."
341200,355200," Aaron Schneider is actually the editor for petapixel just to clarify. Oh for crying out. I'm not a DP review employee. Yeah just just you know but yeah it's the fact is it affects everybody and it is a really big loss for the photographic community."
355200,357200," Amazon bought them."
357200,360200," I don't know like why did they buy that."
360200,375200," In 2007 it was a long time ago digital photography that was still when everyone was buying a digital camera at that point. And yeah I think it was just a very different mindset you know now at this point in time I don't think they would think"
375200,386200," that we would like an editorially independent review channel that we own."
386200,399200," And you know there's like a lot of thought like they were going to start to try to advertise Amazon products push you know cameras through the Amazon market but honestly that didn't really happen and actually for the better because it really let"
399200,408200," you be this credible source of unbiased editorial information. Yeah because to their credit I had no idea I never."
408200,413200," So did they just buy this thing completely forget they even own it at all."
413200,422200," And then and then I feel like almost in the recent like tech layoffs I feel like you guys almost got caught up in that which is kind of weird."
422200,433200," And I know exactly they're not giving us a reason but it's perfect sense. Wait they're not it makes sense. Hold on. So they're not only not providing the public with any reason for this."
433200,438200," They're not providing any of the team any reason for why this is happening."
438200,448200," Well to be fair so Jordan and I are kind of unique right like we were always in Calgary Canada worse or contractors so we don't actually like have an employee status with Amazon."
448200,459200," So as contractors you know yeah it's kind of nice because we get to have that separation from it but also it means that when it comes to all the nitty gritty and the details honestly we don't really know."
459200,466200," Wow. And there's no severance that's another. Yeah no severance yes exactly no. They didn't give you anything."
466200,471200," I don't know a lot of good office supplies."
471200,474200," Nice."
474200,490200," You know I mean the best part. I heard in the chaos of all the layoffs at Twitter in particular but even some other companies like Google where people are getting emails that their jobs are redundant they're sitting here going well I've got all this equipment."
490200,504200," If you want it back I guess you're the one who's coming to get it by the way I've been working from home for the last year and a half so I guess you're coming to boondocks mountain road you know Oregon or whatever to come get it."
504200,514200," So have you guys just been left with like a bunch of equipment and stuff that they are how does that even work like did you have notice."
514200,528200," So we did have a bit of a heads up certainly more than some people but less than others within the company so we did know this is coming which is you know why we were able to find another place to bring our show relatively quickly."
528200,542200," We you know it was funny there's always this running joke of like when is Amazon going to remember that they own us and then do something about you know whatever it is right like we expected at any moment there be restructuring or like oh this is changing"
542200,556200," but you know it was it was great and and I think Jordan I both agree we have to say we've been there five years which is a significant part of our career absolutely but there are people who have worked at that company for far far longer"
556200,567200," and so you know some all not at the beginning but really at the early stages of the peer view and so we really feel for those people they poured their entire heart and soul into this website so"
567200,582200," when we were in Seattle we got to talk to the team it was really nice and you know kind of say hi to everybody say goodbye to everybody it was really quite emotional and so you know we're lucky we're lucky we're moving to petapixel we land on our feet we've got we've got connections that way so we're good we're happy"
582200,590200," but we definitely hope that the other staff they're the writers and the staff have been there forever can find good positions to move forward in the careers."
590200,596200," One of our biggest concerns is just go ahead no no you go ahead."
596200,611200," It is there's such an amazing repository of information like John said in his quote there you know that needs to be preserved and you know I'm certainly there's it's going to wind up in the internet database but all of the useful tools you know like"
611200,622200," camera comparison tools things like that those are all going to be broken and none of it's going to be searchable. So yeah I hope someone is able to find some way to make that you know recover it and keep it public."
622200,636200," I gotta say like the feedback that we've been getting has been so good like you know people have been really supportive really wonderful but at the same time there's lots of feedback where people are justifiably upset and I totally feel for them because this is a website that"
636200,648200," so many youtubers so many you know amateur photographers videographers everybody to some extent or another has used this resource or uses it daily and so I really understand that that's like"
648200,658200," yeah it's like something that's part of you that's going to be torn out it's it's really yeah and you know what is honestly the most frustrating thing for me because"
658200,671200," the first I heard of this wasn't in a in a news article or anything like that it was members of our community reaching out to me kind of going you know oh my God have you seen this and is there anything you can do like"
671200,685200," can you buy it or something and I'm sitting here going okay well a there's some problems with that I suspect the model is a little bit unsustainable at this point I can"
685200,704200," from a business standpoint understand why Amazon might want to cut it loose but then even on the flip side of that this is such an insignificant asset to a company like Amazon operating at a scale like Amazon that what I suspect is that even if you know I could get uncle"
704200,733200," Jeffy on the phone and say you know hey can you put in a word for me to the CEO of the Vice President of the General Manager of the you know Director of the janitor that is in charge of DP review right like if you could put in a word for me could I buy this thing I feel like they basically just go honestly it's not even it's the pocket change that we'd get from selling it is not even worth it so"
733200,762200," while these preservation efforts like you said are so important and and and I'm so grateful for them there is actually no way to stop the loss that you're talking about where it's not searchable anymore where the tools don't work anymore and as someone who you know I have to confess never contributed probably in a meaningful way to DP review I mean I didn't donate or you know like I don't think I don't I probably never even used an affiliate link"
762200,783200," I feel bad about it now because the handful of times I did interact with the site it was so like it was a lifesaver because there was nothing else like it so I want us all to take a moment if if you're if you guys are able and Luke I don't know did you use DP review at all"
783200,800200," no okay so I historically just talked to Brandon that makes sense yeah so can we all share our first time using DP review do you guys remember sure okay do you guys want to go first I got mine teed up but"
800200,825200," yeah I mean I was really interested in video but then was unemployed and got a job at a photo camera store and was I was grossly ill equipped for that I didn't know anything about it so every night I just got home and poured over DP review.com and that is how I basically developed my entire knowledge of everything"
825200,837200," I'm doing a digital photography and I mean now I've been running a photography YouTube show for more than a dozen years I mean you could say it's life changing my life yeah absolutely yeah"
837200,848200," if I hadn't if DP review didn't exist I would walk into my job the next day they'd realize I didn't know a damn thing and I'd be back out on the street so yeah and it is a resource that I use"
848200,869200," every single day I just want to point out before I start my story we had our door a little light certificate guys but much like DP review they've gone out to see I know I'm sorry I'm sorry you do that hard on the floor but you know yeah I started working at the camera store as well well"
869200,884200," Jordan was wearing a different outfit I was working for the camera store in Calgary where we built our first YouTube channel and unlike Jordan I didn't research on DP review before helping customers I would help customers realize I didn't know anything about the camera I was trying to sell them"
884200,898200," and then I would go that night and I would go on DP review and I would but that was the resource I mean there's so many small little digital point shoot cameras I was right at the cusp of where the camera store had a tiny glass showcase with digital cameras and we had to learn them"
898200,912200," and they were like $900 which back then was like 10 million right yeah so it was it was really important to learn brand new technology every photographer is like I'm not touching that garbage that's a toy that's not right you know medium format all the way to like die"
912200,930200," oh that's such a good point like the fact that you review has been they were the ones who effectively like made DP made digital photography understandable to people who wouldn't have accepted it like trailblazing right like I'm thinking about this going"
930200,950200," this site has been around for 25 years I was 11 I was 11 when DP review was founded right so so my story sorry well am I interrupting or was no go for yeah so so my story is that before I got into computers"
950200,976200," one of the things that made me so jelly aside from his CD burner okay was one of my friends in high schools dad had a digital camera and the only reason that I cared about a digital camera at all at that point in my life was that I did not have any way there was no digital means of taking a real world object and representing it on my computer in my household"
976200,1005200," and so when I was on MSN messenger okay or the palace which was this like weird predecessor to Habbo hotel yeah I had no way of having a representation of myself on my computer because I didn't own a digital camera and so my first my first digital camera was this weird I can't even remember what it was called I want to say like flip or it was like a weird predecessor to the flip it was like a little like action camera that"
1005200,1023200," like a like a rectangle a little vertical thing yeah but it was pre flip I think flip was like a better one that came later something I don't even remember the brand but my aunt got it for me for Christmas and she was super impressed with herself and I took one picture with it and I was like you really need to return this because I might as well have nothing"
1023200,1045200," I was a lot nicer about it I was a lot nicer about it but oh man but what that crappy device that you know really the quality was like what Vtech might have put out like 10 years ago like really it was awful but what that crappy device did was it it sparked a curiosity"
1045200,1066200," and what I what I ended up doing was when I was only I was in grade 10 I think so I was only 15 was it made me want to learn about it and I ultimately ended up with a Canon power shot a 20 and the reason I settled on it was because"
1066200,1093200," double A's yeah well hey those double A's do you work for a digital photography review channel how did you know that yeah so I got a pack of I mean you didn't have like good double A's back then it was all it was all nickel cadmium right so no nickel metal hydride yet but no anteloops but you could get rechargeables so I got myself a pack of four rechargeables and a two battery charger"
1093200,1108200," that you couldn't get you know a 12 bay charger for you know 30 bucks on Amazon yet at that point but I remember that weird brand that the battery was like kind of like tan colored and it was like really muscular do you guys remember that?"
1108200,1137200," I know that logo like don't recall yeah I don't remember what it's called but I had one of those muscular double A's and and I ended yeah they were awful and I ended up with this Canon power shot a 20 because DP review determined that it was pretty okay and it was kind of the entry level so it's 2.1 megapixels it was the entry level of what could be acceptable at all but without you know"
1137200,1164200," completely breaking the bank and that was all I could afford at the time and that camera like man I still look at pictures I took on that camera and I never open I never open a photo album so it changed my life in that way too and I wouldn't have been able to I wouldn't have known what to buy as just an ignorant 15 year old if it hadn't been for DP review they were so far ahead even back then of the competition in terms of thoroughness in terms of professionalism"
1164200,1179200," like you had a lot of people back then like they would they would rank digital cameras like I don't want to throw consumer ports on to the bus or anything but let's do it you know and they would just do like four out of five stars or three out of five stars right"
1179200,1209000," and it's like oh fits good in hand you know images go on to computer right or C net or whatever right not that I want to throw anybody under the bus makes color pictures and then DP review they would actually like test these things out and they would they would show you sample photos and they would talk about pros and cons I mean how many of us except Luke because you know Luke's never been on the website but all the rest of us like you know the reviews and you can even just go to the conclusion at the end and you could get"
1209000,1223000," a full breakdown and I bet you there's a lot of youtubers you know our peers that would all admit I mean you know and us included DP review was also how we would fact check our work and make sure that we weren't just talking about our assets it was really wonderful"
1223000,1236000," that's actually such a good point these these unsung heroes doing the real work that allowed you know ignorant schmucks like us to become the"
1236000,1254000," like the face of the space right like I owe my entire career to sites like a non tech you know forums like extreme systems dog I didn't found I didn't found these places I didn't know anything I was just I was just hungry for knowledge right"
1254000,1274000," and you know now we're seeing all of all of these places either disappear or become a shell of what they once were now one of the other discussion topics that I wanted to get into with you guys is you know this and this might be a fun one what the heck was Amazon's plan for DP reviews"
1274000,1289000," because I did they even have the affiliate program yet in 2007 like internally did you guys have any idea what was in it for them 2007 they were still growing their their like the different brands and categories that they covered"
1289000,1295000," and like when did they stop just selling books well yeah like when did Amazon even start"
1295000,1310000," I feel like I feel like it's actually like very very old like actually the beginning of Amazon is quite quite old but I think once they try to get out of books was 94 yeah yeah when did they"
1310000,1324000," so in time you know we can we can only guess right I mean again we think it was probably the time where they're trying to acquire the biggest resources in many different you know fields and just try to get their fingers in as many pots as possible"
1324000,1339000," and I mean because so many people went to DP review like I think in some ways it made sense is like people who are educated like you were saying line us you know if you can feel confident in the decision because you have information you buy more stuff"
1339000,1348000," you know so I do think there was an era there where they were like oh we want to get out as much consumer information as possible I can't speak to why they bought it I was a child"
1348000,1364000," I'm so glad you brought that up because clearly and it's a funny thing because until very recently you know it's been Jeff Bezos at the helm of Amazon since its inception clearly he has undergone some kind of fundamental change"
1364000,1382000," because I could absolutely see that being a motivation at the time and looking at some of the earlier Amazon features that were developed around helping people helping guide people to the best solution right clearly that is not a priority anymore"
1382000,1400000," and you look at what a just what a cluster it is what an awful experience it is trying to find the right product on Amazon I mean we did a video recently on the prevalence of scam products on Amazon now that it's a marketplace full of shady sellers and while they say they spend a lot of money fighting these kinds of tactics"
1400000,1421000," clearly it's not working and the solution is to stop doing what you're doing but they just keep doing it right now this is interesting I assume you guys I assume I assume Jeff was just like get me one of everything go one of the best of everything"
1421000,1445000," I just looked up like a history of Amazon and it's long and stuff and I close it because it's too long but in that period they were doing a lot of expansionary stuff and very Amazon fresh trying Amazon music they acquired Audible the year prior in 2006 this is an interesting one this is another thing I maybe I'm just totally ignorant I just don't think about these things"
1445000,1462000," I had no idea they owned IMDB they bought IMDB in 1998 so again but back to what you were saying I could see that being about making sure that people have access to information about quality content right"
1462000,1478000," maybe yeah absolutely if you if you if you're a store that sells all the things getting people excited about buying new things is beneficial yeah I guess so I'm gonna have the best of those particular things yeah or the way it has the most traffic yeah"
1478000,1492000," okay so here's my last here's my last sort of question that I wanted to talk through with you guys who is going to take on this role"
1492000,1509000," I just I don't know who's equipped at this point like there are certainly people who could have the potential like we're gonna continue testing cameras at petapixel but to have that history I mean they might very well do testing that's great right now but"
1509000,1525000," a lot of photographers are using eight year old gear how are you going to be able to compare that thing that you're looking to buy now to what you currently own you're not going to do that yeah and that's why this is such an important historical thing and no one else has this information nearly as concrete"
1525000,1539000," so I'm gonna talk to you sorry keep going have you talked to people at petapixel about how you might address that like are you guys planning on picking up some some older gear to try to give some amount of reference point or"
1539000,1552000," yeah it's tough to say I mean the great thing about petapixels first off we've we've known the people who run it for almost a decade right we've been good friends it made a lot of senses a great relationship and they are very professional about their work as well so"
1552000,1561000," we're happy about that we like working with a company that you know is a team for us and they have the same skills and they have that same kind of work ethic to test cameras and stuff so"
1561000,1573000," we're confident that we have that going forward but yeah as far as the the older cameras the older archives I don't know yeah we rely with on this it's not no so good no more"
1573000,1602000," and certainly we could grab an older camera if it's a right comparison that makes sense but I mean we're never gonna come up with every use case out no and you're not going to that's what's great you're not going to methodically go back and retest every camera like that's that's another real that's it's so sad this you know the library should never close quote is that's that's that's so it hits me right in the feels right because this knowledge shouldn't be lost"
1602000,1620000," yeah but it's it's gone it's the biggest the thing that makes me saddest about all of this though is that it's emblematic of a widespread problem that we have in media today and that's that no frills journalism isn't profitable"
1620000,1639000," it's not even it's apparently not even worth just letting it continue to run it's apparently such a such a an unprofitable awful business that everyone in it wants to get a payday from some sucker who thinks they can turn the ship around"
1639000,1659000," or just dump it all together that's even worse that it apparently isn't even worth selling and it just makes me incredibly sad our chat is blowing up saying what about LTT labs LTT labs is gonna is gonna guys we're we're we're barely set up to the point where where we can start to"
1659000,1680000," really test you know CPUs GPUs things that are core competencies right digital photography is not and there's so much to know there's so much expertise that we don't have and yes someday you know we'd love to we'd love to go toe to toe with you guys I'm ready I'm ready let's go create creative clash you know 20 20 28"
1680000,1698000," file fight you yeah for sure we have we should have like a Canadian creator like a beaver slap fight where like where boxing gloves and then verbally debate because you're like too nice or yeah I don't know man I used to know DOS so you just watch"
1698000,1716000," I can make a batch file like nobody's business but I also I also worry that okay I have to confess people have talked internally before this even went down about whether we're gonna get into digital photography and my answer was I'm kind of worried it's too niche I don't even know if it makes"
1716000,1745000," sense for us to to go into is that a concern that you guys have for the future now that smartphone cameras are so good you know the way I see it we have been hearing this a lot about like all the it's a it's a business model that's doomed and it's gonna fail so but I don't know if I'm really that that skeptical about it like we've had so many changes happen in digital in well in photography in general right and we would format changes when it was film then we had the start of digital and everybody's like oh this is stupid and now it's"
1745000,1774000," you know the predominant thing and then mirrorless and everybody's like oh that's stupid and now it's a predominant thing and smartphones and all those are a gimmick that's not gonna take off and look where we are now and now getting into AI and stuff like I think when we when we talk about imaging in general there's still very much a future there and I can't speak to deep your views financial solubility but you know I know that it seemed like they were doing very well you know we were doing a lot of new projects and stuff so I don't really think it was that."
1774000,1791000," I don't really think it was that I think it's more that's even sad or maybe well you know I think it's more just like adapting to the to the industry and going forward and I'm not too worried about it that way but is it going to be you know SLRs and stuff maybe not as much."
1791000,1807000," It's gonna go back to how it was before you know where everybody had the uncle that was the photographer over that period you know everybody got a compact camera multiple cameras and stuff like that like there was this huge boom that was totally unsustainable."
1807000,1820800," But you know like look we're working for a company now that you know we're with a company now that has more emphasis on things like computers and smartphones and other tech and stuff and I think that's a smart way to go but you know at the same time as you said Linus like"
1820800,1822800," photography digital photography."
1822800,1843800," If while you have time everybody listening you know go to the deep view forums and actually look at also the educational articles and when you really start getting into the science behind things like dynamic range and low light performance and color resolution and stuff like it's advanced science and the people at deep view are so much more intelligent than Jordan and I are."
1843800,1861800," It's very intimidating to go meet them. Right like dummies. They're very intelligent for skilled people with science oriented backgrounds and that's what you need like there's so much science behind it so yeah learn that stuff get into it it's fascinating but yeah it's tough that we don't have that resource anymore."
1861800,1873800," The real resource is just going to be the people that enjoy that resource that are hopefully going to start to maybe branch out make their own educational websites maybe transfer or save some of those archives."
1873800,1875800," We're going to see how it goes. It's interesting to me."
1875800,1890800," On the topic of archiving I'm going to be selfish for one second and mention that we did make 400 over 400 videos for them and we don't know what's going to happen to those and I don't know if you guys can empathize in any way but suddenly potentially lose in YouTube videos."
1890800,1901800," Maybe digital photography this might not be. I don't know if that's something you guys are adult but we would really like to see those stay on the website so definitely you know mention that you know get out there but people know you want those"
1901800,1911800," people to be like those to exist. Maybe digital photography this cool like bootleg underground like oh you go meet a guy and you're like oh man I got a jump drive with an old DP review TV."
1911800,1919800," I got an article on Linus's favorite you know Canon A20 you know I got some test chart shots here."
1919800,1923800," Yeah and we'll NFT our videos and we'll just."
1923800,1930800," Well I mean I don't think I can condone any of the sort of privateering that our guests are talking about today."
1930800,1943800," I personally think it would be a crying shame if Amazon were to lose out on their intellectual property."
1943800,1947800," You know what I can't even do this. It's really easy to download YouTube videos."
1947800,1952800," Yeah yeah it's really easy there's like a lot of tools for that and you know."
1952800,1960800," If you just want to download our entire peer view archive and then you can just like people can just play it while they're trying to fall asleep and stuff."
1960800,1963800," I'd be happy if someone's getting used out of it. Yeah that's great."
1963800,1980800," Alright well hey I think the last thing for us is to thank you for coming on and give you guys a chance to kind of give one more plug for where we can find more content from you guys and if you know where any member of the members of the team who you really you know respect are going to be landing."
1980800,1994800," If you could kind of give some plugs for that as well we just we want to learn right and we have one resource going away so hopefully this can become resource whack-a-mole and no amount of late stage capitalism can kill it."
1994800,1999800," So tell us where we can where we can get our fix our DP fix."
1999800,2007800," Well look I think the first thing I want DP coming at me from all angles."
2007800,2010800," And we'll review it for you we'll tell you how good it is."
2010800,2012800," Nice perfect."
2012800,2013800," Oh man."
2013800,2022800," You know I get the first thing I would say is if anybody out there you know is looking for talented people definitely get in touch with the staff that are deep peer-reviewed."
2022800,2026800," So you're saying that not everyone has found somewhere to land yet basically."
2026800,2036800," Well I don't know but you know like get in touch with them you know put it out there because we've really appreciated a lot of the support that we got just after this announcement so you know give them some love."
2036800,2039800," So thanks for sharing your experience."
2039800,2046800," I hope you got some dinner while you were waiting for us to get through the issues sorted out."
2046800,2053800," Good night everyone."
2053800,2055800," We're good."
2055800,2056800," Everything's good."
2056800,2057800," We're happy to be here."
2057800,2058800," I'm happy to be here."
2058800,2060800," Everyone's happy to be here today okay."
2060800,2069800," And on that note why don't we get into our headline topic for the day which is the update on the LTT hacking."
2069800,2073800," The source for this for this topic is of course."
2073800,2087800," Reddit."
2087800,2088800," Oh okay."
2088800,2092800," Well I mean they seem to know about it before I did."
2092800,2096800," And I want to kind of treat this as a little bit of Q&A."
2096800,2098800," I'm sure Dan I haven't checked."
2098800,2103800," I noticed that about a bazillion merch messages have hit you already."
2103800,2109800," So you know how last week we had 400 we've been live for 44 minutes."
2109800,2112800," I see."
2112800,2115800," And there are 350."
2115800,2120800," Okay I don't even know what we're launching this week but whatever it is you guys are apparently very excited about it."
2120800,2122800," Well I know that's one of them."
2122800,2129800," The point is Dan do we have any merch messages that you could feed me with that are kind of Q&A about what went down."
2129800,2131800," Oh you want some softballs."
2131800,2132800," Yeah here we go."
2132800,2134800," Where was it?"
2134800,2137800," I want softballs to go with my soft."
2137800,2138800," Do you guys hear that?"
2138800,2139800," Oh sorry yeah."
2139800,2143800," He's probably been typing like a merch message response every 17.3 seconds."
2143800,2145800," So his knuckles were tied up."
2145800,2151800," One of the first ones that we got is from Carlos."
2151800,2154800," What came out of this that you most appreciate?"
2154800,2158800," Oh wow you did tee up some softball questions."
2158800,2159800," Good work Dan."
2159800,2160800," You're very welcome."
2160800,2164800," I'm sure you're exhausted."
2164800,2169800," I've thought about this a fair bit because I've had a couple people come up to me internally and ask."
2169800,2173800," You know I know that you didn't do this on purpose."
2173800,2176800," Are you glad it happened?"
2176800,2188800," And my response has been if you told me that I could trade a night sleep for 5,000 slow plane subscribers."
2188800,2192800," A banger 4 million view video."
2192800,2202800," A D brand sponsorship and probably something else you know being trending on Twitter for an entire day."
2202800,2207800," If someone said would you trade a night sleep for all that I would say yes."
2207800,2213800," But if they asked me would you trade a night sleep in a state of panic?"
2213800,2217800," I would say gee."
2217800,2219800," I really don't know about that."
2219800,2224800," I had a blast."
2224800,2226800," See I know you're in your element."
2226800,2227800," I loved it."
2227800,2228800," I had a wonderful time."
2228800,2233800," I didn't even ask him."
2233800,2236800," Just on the line with me and Ivan."
2236800,2241800," Can I go to the office and retrieve this device that we need or check whatever."
2241800,2244800," I didn't even ask him if he was going to be on time for work."
2244800,2247800," I suspect you never even went home."
2247800,2250800," Oh no I didn't know."
2250800,2255800," I was up for what was it?"
2255800,2257800," 41 hours."
2257800,2262800," Luke often talks about missing the early days of Linus Media Group."
2262800,2272800," Not in spite of but because of the state of this constant state of existential crisis that we had."
2272800,2276800," Like the whole thing could dissolve it any second if we didn't go."
2276800,2279800," When we were we'll get to this later we'll get to more details of this later."
2279800,2282800," Some of us had children we had to worry about supporting okay."
2282800,2289800," That was great because then there was more for me to do."
2289800,2294800," At one point in time we're on the line with the developer from Google and our support contact from Google."
2294800,2296800," Both wonderful very helpful people."
2296800,2297800," Thank you very much."
2297800,2302800," We're on the line with them and I'm working with them to restore the status of the various accounts."
2302800,2308800," James I don't know if he said it through voice or if he typed it out but he's like you're having a really good time."
2308800,2311800," I was like yeah this is great."
2311800,2312800," I do this all the time."
2312800,2314800," Let's do this in another week or two."
2314800,2315800," This is my jam."
2315800,2319800," I am feeling like I said I was up for 41 hours."
2319800,2323800," I'm a little older now than when we used to do that a little bit more frequently."
2323800,2326800," The recovery isn't quite there."
2326800,2329800," I'm feeling a little haggard today."
2329800,2330800," Hydrated."
2330800,2333800," Yeah stuff like that."
2333800,2336800," But yeah I loved it."
2336800,2337800," It was great."
2337800,2338800," Yeah."
2338800,2341800," And I feel like that's a culture that you kind of cultivate in your team."
2341800,2344800," Oh dude because I asked to run."
2344800,2350800," I am so upset that I missed Luke's call at 4am because I would have been here."
2350800,2352800," Yeah okay man."
2352800,2355800," Okay so I didn't ask anybody."
2355800,2365800," Joe I knew was on it because I saw him in the discord chat dealing with stuff and then I checked like the ticketing system"
2365800,2367800," and I see him just chugging through stuff."
2367800,2368800," He never even checked with me."
2368800,2374800," He just started working at like 3.30 in the morning and checked in way later in the day and was like yep"
2374800,2376800," I haven't slept doing tickets."
2376800,2378800," I'm just like sick."
2378800,2380800," I never asked him to do it."
2380800,2381800," He's just doing it."
2381800,2382800," AJ is in early."
2382800,2384800," Everybody's like in early."
2384800,2385800," I didn't ask anyone to come in early."
2385800,2386800," Everybody's working late."
2386800,2388800," I didn't ask anyone to work late."
2388800,2389800," They're just like yeah there's problems."
2389800,2390800," We're fixing them."
2390800,2393800," I sent a message in our like here."
2393800,2397800," I'm going to do it out because it was actually so."
2397800,2398800," Well he looks that out."
2398800,2399800," I love this stuff."
2399800,2400800," Here's the problem okay."
2400800,2406800," Floatplane our video platform for those of you who are not the few of you who are not watching on Floatplane"
2406800,2409800," because as far as I can tell everyone's watching on Floatplane right now."
2409800,2416800," Floatplane is our in house video streaming platform that has grown astronomically."
2416800,2420800," Like 5,000 new subscribers more than that in the last 24 hours."
2420800,2424800," We set a stretch target okay for the social team."
2424800,2426800," We set a stretch goal."
2426800,2431800," In fact I don't even think we had told the team yet but Colton and I were talking about it."
2431800,2437800," Hey maybe we could set like a stretch goal of 40,000 subscribers by the end of the year."
2437800,2439800," Is that reasonable?"
2439800,2440800," Is that something they could."
2440800,2442800," We're at 39,750."
2442800,2445800," At our current rate we might pass that before I go to sleep."
2445800,2455800," Yes and so anyway it's been incredible but the problem with adding that many new users."
2455800,2462800," Okay new fresh users who are looking at it now is that it puts strain on systems that you might not even realize"
2462800,2465800," because they're all on the site all at the same time."
2465800,2467800," For example the chat."
2467800,2474800," Okay we've had an issue that we've known about for a long time where if the chat rate is too hard"
2474800,2479800," on float plane it doesn't automatically scroll down to the latest."
2479800,2482800," You have to like manually click it to scroll down all the time."
2482800,2487800," Well it was never a problem because not that many people were watching but I actually noticed last night"
2487800,2492800," when I did my welcome to float plane stream because I had noticed we had 5,000 new people"
2492800,2497800," and I figured geez these guys all came on to float plane to show their love."
2497800,2498800," We should say hi."
2498800,2503800," They came on to be the first to know what's going on."
2503800,2506800," Should they really be finding out in a YouTube video?"
2506800,2510800," The answer to that is no I'm very tired I'm very hungry but I'm going to go on float plane."
2510800,2511800," I'm going to do a stream."
2511800,2516800," Yeah hang out with you guys for a little bit thank you for showing up and I noticed that I had to constantly"
2516800,2517800," fix the chat."
2517800,2520800," So to go down the bottom I've never seen this issue before."
2520800,2524800," And that's just because we have so many more people on the site."
2524800,2527800," So the team has pushed extremely hard."
2527800,2528800," Oh yeah."
2528800,2529800," So right okay what were you going to say?"
2529800,2534800," Yeah so the I sent oh what when we oh no I know where it is give me one second."
2534800,2539800," He's got this his brain is just operating at the same speed as his horrible phone that he hates."
2539800,2544800," I sent this message I don't even know when this was because time at this point is an illusion"
2544800,2547800," but I think it was last night technically."
2547800,2552800," Great job everyone huge effort from everyone involved was extremely proud of everyone stepping up to get stuff done"
2552800,2556800," and keep us moving forward despite the issues and massive influx of users."
2556800,2561800," Was a great reminder of how this team is very much made of people I enjoy working with."
2561800,2563800," And I love those types of reminders."
2563800,2564800," Yeah you know what I mean?"
2564800,2571800," Like stuff just starts hitting the fan and when you don't even like have to ring the bell everyone just shows up"
2571800,2572800," and is like I'm on it."
2572800,2574800," That's so cool."
2574800,2576800," It's so sweet."
2576800,2577800," Also yeah."
2577800,2583800," Hey Jay and Jayden in the chat here talking about even new rarer features."
2583800,2585800," Yeah did you even know about that?"
2585800,2590800," You said something about low latency streaming on floatplane but I didn't know we were rolling it out."
2590800,2593800," Are we just pushing things to prod now?"
2593800,2596800," Like is that how we manage floatplane now?"
2596800,2597800," Some of the things."
2597800,2600800," So what we make you CTO of Linus Media Group you get all busy with password migrations."
2600800,2601800," To prod on Fridays!"
2601800,2605800," And everything just completely goes to hell in a hand basket over on the floatplane."
2605800,2611800," Are you saying you can't do two jobs at once and host the most popular tech podcast in the world?"
2611800,2614800," Are you saying I ask too much?"
2614800,2617800," Or do I ask too little because you seem to be having the time of your life."
2617800,2618800," That's great."
2618800,2627800," What are my family members reached out with like concern because they saw everything going on and they're like are you doing okay"
2627800,2629800," and I'm like this is awesome."
2629800,2631800," Trust me I'm good."
2631800,2638800," I was commenting to someone because they're like how haven't you fallen asleep yet at like hour 35 or something."
2638800,2646800," And I'm like I'm good actually just if I stop working I'm done but like as long as there's something to do I'm just going to keep cruising."
2646800,2649800," Yeah it was good it was good."
2649800,2651800," I do have a bone to pick with you."
2651800,2653800," Oh we have to fight."
2653800,2663800," But I think we should do we want to recap people on like what happened or do we just assume they know because the internet was real on top of this."
2663800,2666800," Yeah I couldn't believe how viral this went."
2666800,2669800," I mean shout out our forum moderators right."
2669800,2670800," And discord."
2670800,2682800," I have never when I when I dropped in on the thread about this I assumed that people were discussing the hack in some like ancient thread and off topic that's just been around for years."
2682800,2685800," Because it already had like 70 pages or something like that."
2685800,2692800," The second it happened everything else we had just got slammed like tons of people hit the store tons of people hit the forum tons of people hit flow plane."
2692800,2694800," People were just like how's everything else doing."
2694800,2697800," And they wanted to talk about it and stuff which I mean that's great."
2697800,2698800," Makes sense."
2698800,2699800," Yeah."
2699800,2707800," But I just yeah just the fact that everyone again like the forum moderators are another example of a team that went into disaster response."
2707800,2714800," So immediately without me even acknowledging that they are working so hard as volunteers in the community."
2714800,2718800," Like just thank you very much everyone."
2718800,2722800," I forget where like you my issue right now."
2722800,2724800," The brain's all fried."
2724800,2729800," Is that I actually can talk myself past my my my ram buffer in my brain."
2729800,2730800," Yeah."
2730800,2735800," And no longer have any idea how I started even the sentence that I am now trying to complete."
2735800,2738800," So I don't know what I was talking about anymore."
2738800,2745800," Yeah we're both we're both not as great at recovering from lack of sleep as we used to because I actually bet you this would not have been a problem back in the day."
2745800,2748800," And I can't help you because I'm in the exact same situation."
2748800,2749800," Cool."
2749800,2752800," The other thing that I can't do right now is multitask like at all."
2752800,2754800," I noticed if I start work is I can't hear."
2754800,2755800," Right."
2755800,2756800," Right."
2756800,2757800," We're supposed to be doing the series of events."
2757800,2758800," Okay."
2758800,2761800," So it happened the Internet exploded."
2761800,2764800," I can I can give you guys a little bit more detail."
2764800,2767800," You know in the video I wanted to keep everything actionable."
2767800,2772800," You know here's what's actionable for our team because I know every person in this building watched that video."
2772800,2773800," There's no way they didn't."
2773800,2781800," And here's what's actionable for Google because I know that video is making the rounds at Google."
2781800,2785800," So I wanted to really focus on what we can do differently what they can do differently."
2785800,2787800," How do we solve this problem?"
2787800,2789800," And it's a huge problem."
2789800,2792800," I actually had the creator of here."
2792800,2796800," Let me just find my discord here."
2796800,2802800," I had the creator of where's this damn message."
2802800,2804800," I'm just gonna grab."
2804800,2806800," Same problems."
2806800,2809800," How do you how do you just find."
2809800,2811800," There's a search."
2811800,2815800," Yeah, I just don't even know which discord I was in."
2815800,2816800," Here it is."
2816800,2817800," Okay."
2817800,2822800," The creator of filmont.com which is a super cool."
2822800,2823800," Oh my god."
2823800,2824800," My folding phone."
2824800,2826800," It just dropped me into a completely different district."
2826800,2827800," Okay."
2827800,2833800," The creator of a super cool site filmont.com it's a subtitle YouTube search."
2833800,2838800," So you can search YouTube videos by their subtitles."
2838800,2843800," So if you want to find every video where I said dang it Luke."
2843800,2847800," You can just key that in and it'll bring it up including the timestamp."
2847800,2848800," Very interesting."
2848800,2849800," So cool."
2849800,2856800," Anyway, because he archives and oh my words."
2856800,2864800," Because he archives subtitles you can actually search his tool for certain keywords that might"
2864800,2866800," indicate that a channel has been taken over."
2866800,2872800," So he has a feed of videos that are being added and deleted on about 20 million channels."
2872800,2873800," Not the entire site."
2873800,2878800," And he can extract channel name changes which can indicate hacked and taken over channels in history."
2878800,2883800," And this is really cool because he sent me this message that I was totally afraid to open"
2883800,2885800," because I thought it might be a PDF."
2885800,2888800," An executable disguised as a PDF."
2888800,2895800," But he sent me this text file that has every channel in the last 10 days that had its name"
2895800,2899800," changed to Tesla live or Tesla mode."
2899800,2901800," Something with Tesla in it."
2901800,2903800," How many subscribers it has."
2903800,2905800," And look at this list."
2905800,2907800," This is last 10 days."
2907800,2908800," Yeah."
2908800,2911800," Well I showed Jake this thing that you can do."
2911800,2913800," Which is really straightforward."
2913800,2917800," And I think you guys ended up showing it in that video."
2917800,2919800," But if you just search on YouTube, Elon Musk."
2919800,2924800," And then there's not the most obvious thing in the world but there's a filter button."
2924800,2927800," And then it expands different ways that you can filter and you filter by live."
2927800,2931800," And you just scroll through and you look through thumbnails of his face or thumbnails of that"
2931800,2937800," zoom call or thumbnails of some SpaceX stuff because there's SpaceX versions of what happened"
2937800,2938800," to us."
2938800,2939800," Yep."
2939800,2942800," And tons of them have like 5,000 people watching."
2942800,2944800," It's not a small number."
2944800,2947800," There's like at least five or six you'll find."
2947800,2949800," And then you scroll a little bit more if I find five or six more constantly."
2949800,2952800," Just 5,000, 3,000, 2,000 all over the place."
2952800,2954800," So it's crazy."
2954800,2956800," This is a huge problem that needs to be fixed."
2956800,2961800," And the only reason that we haven't raised the alarm about it before is I didn't know about it."
2961800,2962800," Yeah."
2962800,2965800," I just sometimes I'm just in my bubble and working on my stuff."
2965800,2970800," And I just I just don't notice these things but this is disastrous."
2970800,2975800," So I can give you guys a little bit more detail about what things were like in the war room."
2975800,2984800," First of all, when two entities are in an account at the same time trying to make changes at the same time,"
2984800,2986800," things can get a little janky."
2986800,2994800," And one of the reasons that I wasn't able to lock things down was that I didn't, I immediately"
2994800,2999800," went for, okay, the two F.A. is compromised, right?"
2999800,3000800," Okay."
3000800,3001800," It's got to be the two F.A. is compromised."
3001800,3004800," They've got to be in the account."
3004800,3014800," But because the account that was breached was not Linus Tech Tips at gmail.com, not the actual channel owner account,"
3014800,3016800," all of the attempts that I was making."
3016800,3018800," Resetting that password, resetting that two F.A."
3018800,3019800," All I can stuff that stuff."
3019800,3020800," Not just that."
3020800,3021800," Okay."
3021800,3022800," Not just that."
3022800,3031800," Not only was resetting two F.A. and resetting a password, not helping, but even revoking all the devices"
3031800,3035800," that were logged in was not helping."
3035800,3039800," And that's something that a lot of people I think in their responses to this don't realize,"
3039800,3046800," like Linus, as soon as you realize something was wrong, why didn't you just revoke every signed-in device?"
3046800,3049800," Because it didn't fucking work."
3049800,3053800," And so, and you got to remember too, it's 3.30 in the morning."
3053800,3056800," I have foggy, I've been sleeping brain."
3056800,3067800," I am laser focused on figuring out how to secure my two F.A. because I think that it's pretty, you know,"
3067800,3074800," self-explanatory that I don't have a completely separate two-factor authentication system for every single account, right?"
3074800,3079800," So, the YouTube account was not the only thing I was concerned about."
3079800,3082800," So, I'm sitting here going, I'm checking other accounts."
3082800,3084800," Is anything else compromised?"
3084800,3086800," Is anything else breached?"
3086800,3089800," And then I'm like, okay, I'm going to lock them out of LTT."
3089800,3093800," The LTT account was not how they got in."
3093800,3099800," Then, I realized I don't know how to use the content manager system."
3099800,3101800," I didn't set it up, cold set it up."
3101800,3106800," I don't know, maybe I should just call them in the middle of the night, but I didn't."
3106800,3109800," Because I thought, okay, I can probably figure this out."
3109800,3113800," It's just a matter of like resetting passwords and, you know, lock it down, lock it down."
3113800,3125800," But it took me a while to figure out how to manage who has access to a particular channel through content manager."
3125800,3131800," Then, and this is something I didn't want to throw at YouTube at the time because it just didn't feel constructive."
3131800,3143800," Once I did figure out how to lock people out, whether it's a flaw of the system, whether it's because our account had been flagged in some way, I couldn't lock it down."
3143800,3156800," So, even once I knew, so the way it works is with your Linus Media Group email, you're assigned a role, some kind of role that gives you varying levels of access to the various channels."
3156800,3167800," And the Linus Tech Tips one, because it has so many people who work on it, even in an uploader capacity, because like the business team, for example, uploads sponsored videos, the writers upload non-sponsored videos."
3167800,3174800," Like there's all these different workflows and there's all these different reasons that a lot of people do need to have some level of access to it."
3174800,3179800," The Linus Tech Tips one has quite a few people that have some role or another."
3179800,3187800," And because I had finally figured out the vector, I was trying to lock it down and it would time out every single time."
3187800,3189800," So even once I knew..."
3189800,3190800," Yeah, that one's rough."
3190800,3192800," That's why the additional channels went down."
3192800,3196800," So even once I knew, I couldn't stop it."
3196800,3204800," And now fortunately, as we made our way into the smaller channels, there were fewer and fewer people who had roles and we were able to lock them down."
3204800,3207800," That's why we only lost LTT, TechLink, and TechWicki."
3207800,3212800," Because obviously these scammers wanted to go for the biggest channels first."
3212800,3214800," I'm kind of surprised."
3214800,3215800," That's a huge problem."
3215800,3220800," They didn't take not even that much extra time."
3220800,3222800," I probably shouldn't put ideas in people's head."
3222800,3225800," But not even that much extra time and just hit all of them at once."
3225800,3228800," That surprised me a little bit."
3228800,3230800," Yeah, I don't know."
3230800,3231800," It's a good question."
3231800,3244800," There were a few things that were very confusing to me, especially because I wasn't familiar with this sort of attack where they hijack your session token from your browser and then act like they are your browser, even though they're accessing your own network."
3244800,3246800," Or even though they're accessing it from somewhere else."
3246800,3251800," Now, here's something that I'm really confused about because I've encountered this on many accounts."
3251800,3256800," And unfortunately, I've never thought about it, so I don't know if I've ever seen it on a Google account."
3256800,3262800," But when you access a service with a token that was created somewhere..."
3262800,3264800," Okay, I pee stuff."
3264800,3266800," So as far as my understanding goes..."
3266800,3271800," They just VPN through somewhere that they think is probably close to me and hoping that the token will last."
3271800,3282800," I did see that there, when looking through a bunch of logs and stuff, I did see that certain device connection things were coming from Vancouver, Canada."
3282800,3283800," I see."
3283800,3287800," I don't know if all of them did."
3287800,3295800," I remember at one point in time talking about a device connecting from a certain country, but I don't know if we were..."
3295800,3303800," The person and I were talking, I don't know if we were just using that as a country that's far away."
3303800,3306800," Or if that was actually a connection that happened."
3306800,3317800," But I don't know that Google... I have heard from other people, but this is entirely hearsay at this point, so I really don't want to claim it as anything."
3317800,3322800," That Google doesn't really do IP checks on those cookies."
3322800,3330800," The conversation that I had with this person was they were going, \"Wow, I'm always surprised that Google doesn't do this because all these other services do.\""
3330800,3332800," But I don't know if that's true."
3332800,3334800," Well, here's the thing, right?"
3334800,3339800," If the geographical location changes dramatically, then it's kind of a no-brainer."
3339800,3341800," But if they're VPNing through..."
3341800,3350800," If they're coming into Vancouver, through somewhere close to you, then that could be something as simple as switching from your Wi-Fi to your friends Wi-Fi."
3350800,3352800," You don't want to log back into everything with you."
3352800,3354800," We do know that..."
3354800,3355800," Oh, yeah, no."
3355800,3358800," Okay, there was definitely one connection that happened from Germany."
3358800,3359800," For sure."
3359800,3361800," We saw that."
3361800,3363800," That's a..."
3363800,3366800," I don't know if that had anything to do with the Google accounts or anything else, though."
3366800,3370800," I know that happened at one point for one thing."
3370800,3376800," If any of the Google accounts, and that one that came from Germany was from a VM provider in Germany."
3376800,3377800," Very trackable."
3377800,3378800," Right."
3378800,3379800," In my opinion, it wouldn't be..."
3379800,3380800," You mean VPN provider?"
3380800,3381800," What did I say?"
3381800,3382800," You said VM provider."
3382800,3383800," Yeah, I meant VPN."
3383800,3384800," Sorry, a little..."
3384800,3385800," He got it."
3385800,3388800," We got there."
3388800,3402800," If they used a VPN provider to get to a node that's in Vancouver, personally, I would throw crazy red flags on an account that went from its rough location to pretty close to its rough location."
3402800,3404800," Yeah, I mean, if Netflix can do it."
3404800,3405800," Yeah, like, make them re-login."
3405800,3409800," You don't have to go nuclear, but just make them re-login."
3409800,3414800," Yeah, maybe don't even make them have multiple factors."
3414800,3417800," Or maybe make that something you can configure."
3417800,3418800," But do something."
3418800,3419800," They can do a 2FA or something, yeah."
3419800,3420800," Or don't make them a 2FA."
3420800,3422800," Like, they're a 2TF code or whatever."
3422800,3423800," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
3423800,3426800," Maybe just make them put in a one-time code."
3426800,3427800," Yeah."
3427800,3428800," Right?"
3428800,3429800," I would consider that to be something."
3429800,3431800," Just some form of like, \"Hey, something weird happened."
3431800,3432800," Are you good?\""
3432800,3434800," Yeah, we couldn't help noticing that there was some weird stuff."
3434800,3435800," Yeah, oh, man."
3435800,3436800," That was another really frustrating one."
3436800,3438800," I don't know 100% what they do, though."
3438800,3443280," As part of the lockdown attempts that I was making, I was trying to change the recovery"
3443280,3448320," phone number on the Linus Tech Tips at gmail.com account because I thought, you know, maybe"
3448320,3451960," that had been compromised, it's sim hijacked or something like that."
3451960,3453800," And it was airing out every time."
3453800,3455800," That's just like, come on."
3455800,3456800," Now's a bad time."
3456800,3461120," And part of the error out was that as I was doing it, it was trying to re-authenticate"
3461120,3462120," me."
3462120,3464800," And I'm like, \"Okay, now you do it.\""
3464800,3466880," But then it was causing it to error out."
3466880,3467880," Come on!"
3467880,3468880," Okay."
3468880,3472680," I was extremely angry and extremely naked."
3472680,3474680," I was as angry as I was naked."
3474680,3475880," So I was too."
3475880,3483600," And sometimes I really laugh at the similarities between Linus and I because we're different"
3483600,3487760," in a bunch of ways, but then certain things are just like, \"Wow, that's really oddly"
3487760,3488760," identical.\""
3488760,3489760," Yeah."
3489760,3491680," Because our response was literally matched."
3491680,3495120," The second I figured out about it, I didn't call you immediately."
3495120,3498800," I don't remember exactly how it went, but I tried to verify because someone informed"
3498800,3500000," me and I was on my phone."
3500000,3501000," Yeah."
3501000,3502360," And I was like, \"Okay, I need to get to my computer.\""
3502360,3503360," I'm tired."
3503360,3506160," I need to get downstairs, get to my computer, make sure this is real."
3506160,3508240," And then I called you afterwards."
3508240,3514160," But I just immediately bounced out of bed, grabbed my clothes from the day before that"
3514160,3515800," was on my way out."
3515800,3519680," So it didn't take me any extra time, did not bother to put them on."
3519680,3522880," I actually ran downstairs, sat at my computer and just dropped the clothes next to me and"
3522880,3528200," started working and didn't recognize until I think it was an hour and a half later."
3528200,3530720," Well, you're like, \"It could be cold when you're juiced up on adrenaline.\""
3530720,3532400," Oh, yeah, no."
3532400,3536760," But my roommate's door to his room is directly behind my desk."
3536760,3538240," Oh, he could have seen some stuff."
3538240,3541080," So he wakes up at 4.30 every day."
3541080,3542080," He's an early bird."
3542080,3543720," He wakes up and gets in the shower."
3543720,3544720," Yeah."
3544720,3545720," And I hear the shower turn on."
3545720,3546720," I'm like, \"Okay.\""
3546720,3547960," Time to put on clothes."
3547960,3549720," But I didn't know you were."
3549720,3553320," I was similarly naked for the first hour and a half of this thing."
3553320,3554320," Hilarious."
3554320,3557160," I find that very funny."
3557160,3559720," But okay, here's my bone to pick with you, Bucko."
3559720,3560720," Oh, why?"
3560720,3561720," What did I do?"
3561720,3562720," This is why we're fighting."
3562720,3563720," Yeah."
3563720,3564720," Yesterday..."
3564720,3565720," This is the first time hearing of us fighting."
3565720,3566720," Is this like a topic in the dock?"
3566720,3567720," I haven't even read the dock."
3567720,3570600," I didn't want to prime you on it because I didn't want to disrupt your day."
3570600,3571600," Oh, okay."
3571600,3572600," And I wanted to..."
3572600,3574360," I wanted to save the juice for Wancho."
3574360,3577600," Is this because I bailed on the call with the YouTube engineer?"
3577600,3578600," Oh, no."
3578600,3582040," Look, I was doing that bad news session with my kids."
3582040,3583040," I needed to go."
3583040,3584040," I sent the message."
3584040,3585320," I said, \"Good dad at whatever point.\""
3585320,3586320," I genuinely thought that."
3586320,3587840," I had it under control."
3587840,3592000," There wasn't actually much that you could really do that was going to be different or"
3592000,3593000," beneficial."
3593000,3594000," Okay, what is he mad about?"
3594000,3595000," See, should I try to guess?"
3595000,3596080," Do you want to try to figure it out?"
3596080,3597080," Okay."
3597080,3598080," Okay."
3598080,3599840," He's mad, but he's not that mad, but he's clearly a little mad."
3599840,3600840," I'm kind of mad, actually."
3600840,3601840," Okay."
3601840,3602840," Hold on."
3602840,3603840," Hold on."
3603840,3604840," Okay."
3604840,3605840," I'm just like more grown up now."
3605840,3606840," Okay."
3606840,3607840," Okay."
3607840,3608840," I didn't even thought about that."
3608840,3609840," Okay."
3609840,3611840," I shouldn't come up with reasons for him to be mad."
3611840,3614840," Now I'm mad about that."
3614840,3615840," Yeah."
3615840,3616840," What the heck?"
3616840,3621640," I'm digging myself a deeper hole here."
3621640,3625840," My stupid phone doesn't even know when I called you, which is great."
3625840,3626840," It's annoying."
3626840,3629440," I know when the teens call started, but that wasn't the first call."
3629440,3630440," All right."
3630440,3631440," Why are you mad?"
3631440,3632440," Why are you mad?"
3632440,3633440," Okay."
3633440,3637560," I'm in pretty early on this whole thing."
3637560,3638560," Yes."
3638560,3641000," I'm not the first person who calls you, but I got to be pretty early on."
3641000,3642000," Yeah."
3642000,3644840," And I push through the whole thing."
3644840,3646560," I like to think I did pretty well."
3646560,3651240," There's definitely some mistakes, but I think they're relatively minor and acceptable considering"
3651240,3652240," how hard I was."
3652240,3653240," Yes."
3653240,3654240," Make it through this whole thing."
3654240,3655240," I'm feeling pretty good."
3655240,3657240," I go to bed feeling like really good."
3657240,3661520," I'm sitting there waiting for the video to go out because I know there's certain limitations"
3661520,3662840," that accounts can have on YouTube."
3662840,3663840," Yeah."
3663840,3666000," And I'm worried this whole time that we're not actually going to be able to upload."
3666000,3667000," Sure."
3667000,3669000," So I'm waiting just in case like I need to dive back in."
3669000,3670520," I see the video go live."
3670520,3671520," I click on it."
3671520,3672520," It starts to play."
3672520,3673920," I close it immediately."
3673920,3674920," Fall asleep."
3674920,3675920," Yeah."
3675920,3679440," I was probably asleep like potentially before the phone was fully laid down."
3679440,3680440," Yeah."
3680440,3681440," I was out."
3681440,3684440," I wake up because my scheduled alarm goes off at nine in the morning."
3684440,3687880," So I only got like seven hours of sleep after that whole thing."
3687880,3691240," I wake up and immediately I'm like, I want to watch the video now."
3691240,3692240," Uh oh."
3692240,3693240," This is going to be."
3693240,3695600," So I watch the video."
3695600,3698000," What do you think in the video might have pissed me off?"
3698000,3702160," The fact that I didn't specifically call you out as being a helper."
3702160,3706160," Oh, because you might notice I had a writer credit on that video."
3706160,3711320," I did not write myself into it at all because I actually didn't really care."
3711320,3712360," Oh, oh, oh, oh."
3712360,3715120," So what do you think in the video might have pissed me off?"
3715120,3716120," Okay."
3716120,3717120," Hold on."
3717120,3718120," Hold on."
3718120,3719120," Let me think."
3719120,3724040," Because I got roasted for this by a bunch of my friends."
3724040,3725040," Okay."
3725040,3726040," Like a lot of them."
3726040,3727040," Okay."
3727040,3728040," Hold on."
3728040,3729040," Hold on."
3729040,3730040," I still don't know."
3730040,3733440," Like I don't think I've actually had certain people in this space just reach out to me and"
3733440,3736880," be like, are you actually idiot before?"
3736880,3737880," Okay."
3737880,3738880," But they did this time."
3738880,3740040," Wait, wait, wait, hold on, hold on, hold on."
3740040,3741040," Okay."
3741040,3747200," Is it that I didn't acknowledge that it wasn't your job yet to the malware warning we got?"
3747200,3748200," Okay."
3748200,3749200," No, okay."
3749200,3750200," You got to tell me."
3750200,3751200," Okay."
3751200,3752200," So, so."
3752200,3754000," I don't even remember what's in that video."
3754000,3758720," I don't even, I don't think I've even talked to AJ about this and AJ knows one of the problems."
3758720,3759720," There's two problems."
3759720,3760720," Half."
3760720,3761720," Half."
3761720,3762720," Half the time."
3762720,3767160," This one is much less of a problem because I know how you meant it."
3767160,3771360," But the way that you said it, no one else interpreted it that way."
3771360,3772560," Half of what time?"
3772560,3774800," You acknowledged me at one point in the video."
3774800,3777200," And again, I didn't necessarily want to acknowledge me."
3777200,3778200," I'm not."
3778200,3781440," But you did acknowledge me at one point in the video to say that I was there for half of"
3781440,3782800," the night."
3782800,3785480," You said that because the night started at three in the morning."
3785480,3786480," Yeah, because started at three thirty in the morning."
3786480,3787920," It started in the middle of the night."
3787920,3792120," How everyone's going to interpret that is I was there for half of the time."
3792120,3793120," No."
3793120,3795920," And then you didn't reference any other part that I was still working on anything like"
3795920,3796920," that."
3796920,3799520," So people were like, oh, he showed up for half of the bad boy, whatever."
3799520,3800520," That's not what that means."
3800520,3802880," I knew you didn't mean it that way."
3802880,3805280," It started at three thirty in the morning."
3805280,3808160," It's like the half way point of the night."
3808160,3810000," I heard it and I was like, darn it."
3810000,3814400," He's doing that thing that he does with react content and the word that I'm not going to"
3814400,3815800," mention and stuff like that."
3815800,3817200," We were up half the night."
3817200,3818960," Yeah, I got working on the thing."
3818960,3822400," So I was like, I was annoyed by that because of the interpretation that I knew the audience"
3822400,3824760," was going to get and how it painted me."
3824760,3827160," That's not fair to him or to me."
3827160,3829160," But I knew that you didn't mean it that way."
3829160,3830160," Okay."
3830160,3831160," What did I mean?"
3831160,3832160," So I was annoyed, but we're still cool."
3832160,3833160," All right."
3833160,3834160," What are we not cool about that?"
3834160,3836400," We're not cool about it."
3836400,3840640," With thirty five to forty thousand people watching."
3840640,3845480," What we're not cool about and I have multiple witnesses for this, including your wife and"
3845480,3846480," my partner."
3846480,3847960," My wife."
3847960,3852280," You were like, I had no idea what the attack vector was."
3852280,3855880," And if I watched Theo Joe's video, maybe I would have known."
3855880,3856880," Yes."
3856880,3861840," I told you immediately what the problem was."
3861840,3864640," What?"
3864640,3867640," So everyone's messaging me be like, dude, how did you not know?"
3867640,3869440," I did know."
3869440,3870640," Okay."
3870640,3876280," So let me explain that because the private conversation that I had with the bond later"
3876280,3882240," and you probably witnessed some of this was very conciliatory."
3882240,3885560," I was pretty rude to her in the heat of the moment."
3885560,3886960," I did witness that."
3886960,3887960," Yeah."
3887960,3892000," What I said to her was like, I have no excuse for this."
3892000,3893840," I'm really sorry."
3893840,3908440," Not only was I was I was I short, but not even in head."
3908440,3915120," Not only was I short, but I was not attentive enough to the instructions that you were giving"
3915120,3916760," me that would have made the situation."
3916760,3919360," I should not only did I identify the result."
3919360,3920440," It's all it's all faster."
3920440,3922760," I knew exactly what department of the company it went to."
3922760,3925600," I also knew exactly how to fix it."
3925600,3929160," And I asked you if you could log me in, I can fix it for you."
3929160,3932200," And you said, no, I'm focused right now, which is fine."
3932200,3933200," Yes."
3933200,3934200," Which is fine."
3934200,3935200," So that's it."
3935200,3936400," Have the video come out."
3936400,3937400," Okay."
3937400,3938400," That is a banger."
3938400,3941600," I for it to be like, there is no way I could have known."
3941600,3944120," I didn't I didn't say there was no way I could have known."
3944120,3945640," I said I didn't know."
3945640,3950920," And to know I would have had to watch this video, which by the way, shadow Theo Joe was"
3950920,3956400," in the script because again, I got a writer credit on this thing that just roasts me,"
3956400,3958560," which is sick."
3958560,3962080," But that video is in the script because it's an amazing it's really good."
3962080,3963360," It's a very good video."
3963360,3967120," And I knew we weren't going to go into as much detail about the attack and how to avoid"
3967120,3968360," and how to identify and stuff."
3968360,3969360," Yes."
3969360,3971400," So I wanted that video to be referenced because it is fantastic."
3971400,3975280," So I'm not I'm not dogging on on Theo just be like super clear."
3975280,3976280," It's a great video."
3976280,3977280," I wanted it in there."
3977280,3980240," So here's that is not the only way that you could have known."
3980240,3984480," So here's the second thing that I said to Yvonne, which she knows because she's been"
3984480,3990680," with me for 18 years or something like that was that, okay, I do not operate well before"
3990680,3992080," about noon."
3992080,3993920," Never mind at three in the morning."
3993920,3994920," Yeah."
3994920,3995920," Yeah."
3995920,3997960," If I'm still up at three in the morning, I'm sharp as a tack."
3997960,3998960," Still fine."
3998960,4006920," But if I am already up at three in the morning, I am I am non functional at my best."
4006920,4016080," I have diagnosed for real ADD at my absolute best focus, not easy for me."
4016080,4022200," It's one of the things that makes me and her an absolutely incredible team because I'm"
4022200,4023600," going every different direction."
4023600,4028800," I got ideas coming into my brain faster than you could shake a stick at."
4028800,4029800," Right."
4029800,4031960," And she is focused and methodical."
4031960,4036160," She's the one who can actually make sure that anything comes of any of it."
4036160,4037160," Isn't she hurt?"
4037160,4038160," Sorry to."
4038160,4039160," Yeah."
4039160,4040800," She's the one that actually got the accounts."
4040800,4041800," Of course."
4041800,4042800," Yeah."
4042800,4043800," I thought so."
4043800,4044800," Of course."
4044800,4048200," Because because she's the one that is, you know, and I don't know, it's weird because"
4048200,4051440," in certain types of crises, I'm the one who's cool and collected."
4051440,4056440," Like we got sideswiped on the freeway a number of years ago and she's just like in a panic"
4056440,4058080," and I'm sitting here going, okay."
4058080,4065700," You know, signal on, pull over, not on the bridge, over there okay, make sure we flag"
4065700,4067520," them down, make sure they're stopping."
4067520,4069360," Do this, do that, get this information."
4069360,4070360," Take these pictures."
4070360,4073060," In certain types of, in a certain type of crisis-"
4073060,4074060," I'm the one who's collecting."
4074060,4075720," So dynamics are often like that, yeah."
4075720,4079880," In other kinds of crises where we're trying to figure out what's going on."
4079880,4083080," My brain's going, it could be this, it could be this, it could be this, it could be this,"
4083080,4086020," and like I'm trying to, I'm trying to execute anything."
4086020,4092080," And I can't do anything with all these ideas coming in and with not one but two people"
4092080,4096760," talking into each of my ears while I am in a brain fog at three in the morning."
4096760,4101720," I can tell you now with 100% honesty that I have no idea that you ever told me that"
4101720,4103400," or ever asked me that."
4103400,4108800," I know what Vond does because later on in the call, she even, she asked me, she's like,"
4108800,4110000," how did you know it was that?"
4110000,4113800," And I had to explain like, ah, there's, there's been like a bunch of videos, a bunch"
4113800,4114800," of articles."
4114800,4117220," I've been going around quite a bit lately, all that kind of stuff."
4117220,4119300," And I even told her today and she was like, what?"
4119300,4120980," How did he not know that?"
4120980,4125220," And I was like, man, did you, did you know that her and I started trying to work around"
4125220,4126220," you?"
4126220,4127220," Nope."
4127220,4130220," Oh, and so we started on a, on a Wancho, not even that long ago."
4130220,4134660," I talked about how like, Von and I used to butt heads all time and now we're super bros."
4134660,4138180," But during this, you were like going nuclear a little bit."
4138180,4140340," So her and I started PMing each other to get work done."
4140340,4141340," Yeah, yeah, that's good."
4141340,4142340," Like on the side."
4142340,4143340," That's fine, which was great."
4143340,4147600," Okay, because it meant that you guys were quiet, which I could actually focus on anything,"
4147600,4149680," which was actually the goal because it was obvious."
4149680,4152960," Like, I've been in that mode too, where you just like need people to not talk to you."
4152960,4153960," Yeah."
4153960,4157080," But if on and I needed to be in the call with you, yes, but us talking to each other was"
4157080,4158280," going to be really disrupting."
4158280,4161440," So like it, it, it, it made sense."
4161440,4165200," So I'm sorry, but I can honestly tell you I had no idea."
4165200,4166200," Damn it."
4166200,4167200," Okay."
4167200,4168760," I said it like a bunch of times, but I understand."
4168760,4169760," I understand."
4169760,4170760," I wasn't hearing any of it."
4170760,4171760," Yeah."
4171760,4173640," I couldn't even figure out."
4173640,4174960," So here's another thing too."
4174960,4177440," We've been undergoing a password migration recently."
4177440,4178440," Yeah."
4178440,4183560," I couldn't even figure out how to get there were accounts that I couldn't get into, not"
4183560,4191320," because any hijacker had them, but because I didn't have the right credentials anymore."
4191320,4197620," And so part of what I was panicked about was you guys were telling me it was something"
4197620,4198620," or something."
4198620,4199620," You guys were telling me things."
4199620,4201420," And I was like, hold on a second."
4201420,4204720," I think they're in another account, but maybe I can lock this one down."
4204720,4205720," Shut the fuck up."
4205720,4206720," I'm trying to."
4206720,4210660," It was a very chaotic call."
4210660,4212820," Okay."
4212820,4214460," So where are we at in the timeline then?"
4214460,4216540," Because I think that's still technically what we're doing."
4216540,4218220," It's chaos in the middle of the night."
4218220,4219220," Okay."
4219220,4220220," Yeah."
4220220,4221220," Yeah."
4221220,4222220," You, I and Ivana are involved."
4222220,4223860," Hey, you and I are naked."
4223860,4227460," For some reason, she still has her clothes on."
4227460,4232060," Hey, we can make it work."
4232060,4234300," Okay."
4234300,4236900," So what time, so we're struggling with accounts."
4236900,4241720," There's still the question because there was, there was, I don't want to go into why this"
4241720,4246980," time, but there was a reason why we were concerned about to a face stuff."
4246980,4247980," Yes."
4247980,4249620," So I fire off to the office."
4249620,4251580," Something to do with something."
4251580,4252580," Yes."
4252580,4256660," And it was also something to do with why I was having trouble figuring something out."
4256660,4257660," Yeah."
4257660,4258660," Yeah."
4258660,4259660," Yeah."
4259660,4260660," I don't even remember what time that is."
4260660,4261660," I'm not even going to bother looking at it."
4261660,4262660," Doesn't matter."
4262660,4267820," But I, I fire to the office and I start, I don't know if you get this type of feeling, but"
4267820,4272580," while I'm driving in there, definitely legally approved speeds on the road."
4272580,4273580," Don't do that."
4273580,4274580," I start getting, yeah, sure."
4274580,4275580," You're going to get a dead."
4275580,4276580," I'll make it."
4276580,4278580," I always try to speed limit."
4278580,4283620," I wonder who I got it from."
4283620,4285860," What's I going to say?"
4285860,4286860," Yeah."
4286860,4291060," While I'm driving there, I had this like wave of, I don't even necessarily want to call"
4291060,4293700," it a motion, but feeling wash over me."
4293700,4294700," Yeah."
4294700,4298100," Where I recognized that like, this is sick."
4298100,4308780," And like, I knew, I knew it was horrible, but I'm flying to the office."
4308780,4312380," There's like cars on the road because people are waking up to go to work."
4312380,4317660," I've been awake for more than a day and I'm like, this is going to be awesome."
4317660,4319860," I don't know necessarily exactly what's going to happen."
4319860,4324460," I run out the door and my girlfriend's awake because like, I'm freaking out so she can't"
4324460,4325460," fall asleep easily."
4325460,4327620," And as I say, bye to her."
4327620,4330900," Run out the door, get to the car, get to the office, all this kind of stuff."
4330900,4335240," Once I figured out the first thing that I was there for, there was now a second thing"
4335240,4336500," that I was there for."
4336500,4338740," And I was like, whatever, I'm just going to buckle in."
4338740,4339780," I'm here all day."
4339780,4344940," So I grab what I need from where I first started, go to where my desk is at, and then realize"
4344940,4350900," like, I have no, I have no food or water or anything."
4350900,4353900," So I start looking around and there's nothing in the office ready to go."
4353900,4358100," So my girlfriend on her way to work a few hours later drops by and brings me this like"
4358100,4359100," care package."
4359100,4360100," Nice."
4360100,4367660," A change of clothes, deodorant, a toothbrush, and an entire set of like food and drinks"
4367660,4372020," and everything I need for the full day, which was sick."
4372020,4374860," That was like, that was a, that was a banger of a move."
4374860,4380580," That's a way to gain a lot of, a lot of brownie points with me."
4380580,4382060," So I was set and ready to go."
4382060,4384780," And then I just, I just cranked it out for the rest of the day."
4384780,4386980," We had to do a lot of stuff."
4386980,4391660," There was a huge amount of coordination that had like six or seven different email threads"
4391660,4397420," that had to bounce back and forth between you and James and me and Google."
4397420,4405820," We had a plan for what video was supposed to go up that day at, let's see, sometime in"
4405820,4410780," the morning, you know, it's good."
4410780,4412060," You should have gotten a writer credit."
4412060,4413500," You did, you did do work on it."
4413500,4420300," I actually was really surprised I got one because Jake did like 85 per 90, 95, I don't"
4420300,4422060," know, some massive percentage more than me."
4422060,4424100," I was mostly just there like validating."
4424100,4425100," Yes."
4425100,4429380," At some point in the morning, I went into content creator brain mode and I sent this"
4429380,4431020," message."
4431020,4434500," We're clearly not uploading framework today."
4434500,4439680," I have to, I have to go in, I had to go in early because we were shooting something at"
4439680,4441620," 10 with a viewer."
4441620,4442740," So that would have been scheduled."
4442740,4446740," But I basically go, we need to be on this as early as possible, but the outline is basically"
4446740,4447740," this."
4447740,4449380," Size is not necessarily an advantage."
4449380,4452980," Saw some speculation that our size, we must have some kind of uber systems or whatever,"
4452980,4455940," and we're better equipped than most small channels are, but the larger you are, the"
4455940,4457060," larger the attack surface."
4457060,4460540," You can use examples like the way that it came out that some large companies were writing"
4460540,4464420," checks to contractors for hundreds of thousands of dollars without realizing that the invoices"
4464420,4465420," were totally bogus."
4465420,4466860," Do you remember that scam?"
4466860,4469740," The more people, the more potential vectors for attack."
4469740,4470900," 2FA."
4470900,4473100," You guys talk about it all the time, don't you use it?"
4473100,4474100," It's not perfect."
4474100,4475100," Discuss problems with 2FA."
4475100,4476260," Factors can be compromised."
4476260,4479660," For convenience, we often have multiple secondary factors which increases the attack surface"
4479660,4480660," again."
4480660,4485060," And importantly, almost every account still has text/email as an automatic account recovery"
4485060,4488460," system of some sort, both of which can be vulnerable."
4488460,4489580," So was it sick?"
4489580,4490580," So what?"
4490580,4491580," It was simjacking again?"
4491580,4492740," How could you be stupid enough to fall for that again?"
4492740,4494180," And how is this even a video?"
4494180,4495860," Actually no, it's not the same as last time."
4495860,4498620," Detailed explanation of session hijacking and how that could be used to gain access to"
4498620,4500620," an account temporarily and even change credentials."
4500620,4501620," We'll need help with this."
4501620,4502620," I have that in bold."
4502620,4506540," Apparently I didn't remember that I did get help with that, so that's cool."
4506540,4509060," Something that wouldn't have been nearly as effective if it wasn't for our content manager"
4509060,4510060," system."
4510060,4511620," Shout out what YouTube did well."
4511620,4516580," Shout out what YouTube could do better with detailed blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
4516580,4520340," It's clear that we have disaster response processes to improve."
4520340,4523580," I realized that for in the morning or whatever, shout out Steve from Gamers Nexus."
4523580,4527540," Here's what's going to happen."
4527540,4531660," I think that was shortly before I put together the kids lunches because Yvonne basically"
4531660,4534980," was like, \"Okay, I'm going through and changing all the accounts,\" which I guess meant she's"
4534980,4537340," working with you to change all the accounts."
4537340,4540140," Which meant that Dan did most of it."
4540140,4547780," Yvonne did all of the ultra high threat recently screwed over account stuff, meaning she did"
4547780,4550420," all the channels and stuff like that."
4550420,4554540," Then Dan power suit one password every 1.2 minutes."
4554540,4558460," I'm going to type and look nowhere else other than my screen for 16 hours."
4558460,4563740," All the remaining accounts, which was fantastic because I planned to help him and then there"
4563740,4566620," was just way too much other stuff to do."
4566620,4570700," I prepared lunches for the kids for school."
4570700,4575140," I think this happened sometime either before or after that."
4575140,4577980," This is like seven something, I guess."
4577980,4580820," Man, so then I came into the office."
4580820,4584540," I was in content mode because- At this point in time, sorry, I need to pull this back slightly"
4584540,4585540," for one second."
4585540,4591140," At this point in time, we have identified, I think it was mentioned earlier, it wasn't"
4591140,4592140," the primary account."
4592140,4596780," It was an account who had access to multiple different channels that we have."
4596780,4600300," At this point in time, we have identified who's account it was."
4600300,4601300," Oh, that was frustrating."
4601300,4603500," We've identified what computer it was."
4603500,4607780," We've identified that person is online communicating with me."
4607780,4609060," They're helping me figure stuff out."
4609060,4614300," Google knew for hours which account it was but never communicated that to us except via"
4614300,4621740," an automated system that thankfully Yvonne happened to get a notification from."
4621740,4623620," They didn't tell us, \"Hey, it's this one."
4623620,4627020," Turn this computer off.\""
4627020,4628020," Anyway."
4628020,4629020," Yeah."
4629020,4630020," Hi."
4630020,4634140," I ran over and unplugged it and it's hiding by my desk now so that people don't plug it"
4634140,4636460," in and stuff."
4636460,4640060," At this point in time, we have a lot of the information."
4640060,4641820," We know the exact attack vector."
4641820,4644180," We know literally the file."
4644180,4647220," We know the name of the file, all this kind of stuff from the antivirus software and all"
4647220,4648740," these different types of things."
4648740,4653660," We are very informed but there's a massive ocean of work to do."
4653660,4656740," Three channels are offline."
4656740,4660260," Damage has been done and we're in recovery mode and all that kind of stuff."
4660260,4661260," We are very well informed."
4661260,4662260," We know what's going on."
4662260,4663260," Yeah."
4663260,4664260," Sorry, keep going."
4664260,4665260," No, no."
4665260,4666260," Okay."
4666260,4671380," Well, I guess the next thing for me is I rolled into office and was not surprised at all that"
4671380,4672380," you were already there."
4672380,4674060," I wasn't sure."
4674060,4675580," Maybe you passed out or whatever."
4675580,4677620," I wouldn't have blamed you."
4677620,4681780," If there's still stuff to do, then it also didn't surprise me."
4681780,4682780," Yeah."
4682780,4685940," Then I was making videos and then right."
4685940,4689700," My focus for the rest of the day was, \"Holy crap."
4689700,4695140," How do we get this video about the hijacking out?\""
4695140,4697580," I'm thinking strategy, right?"
4697580,4706020," That's what I'm good at is, \"Okay, with all these pieces of information, what's the"
4706020,4707580," battle plan?"
4707580,4712980," What pieces can I move around on the board to execute methodically?\""
4712980,4714820," I'm sitting here going, \"Okay."
4714820,4715820," No."
4715820,4716820," Change of plans."
4716820,4720460," No framework laptop video today, even if the channel comes back online."
4720460,4724540," We need to get all the right people connected with all the right other people on YouTube"
4724540,4728740," because I know that I'm going to be basically MIA and not able to respond to them today."
4728740,4731420," So I need to get all those contacts handed off."
4731420,4736940," Then we need to figure out what are we going to do to keep all these spam, scam notifications"
4736940,4740860," that the channel was sending out from affecting us algorithmically."
4740860,4741860," So that was my focus."
4741860,4742860," All right."
4742860,4744740," So I need to get this video shot."
4744740,4748860," And then we need to figure out what are we uploading when and if this channel comes back"
4748860,4754460," online because what it was supposed to be was an update from framework, the laptop company"
4754460,4756500," that I am invested in."
4756500,4763180," That would have been great as a banger of a video, but would it be enough to give us"
4763180,4769780," the algorithmic kick in the ass that we need to overcome whatever, whatever, because I"
4769780,4774660," mean, it's not like I didn't see people saying, \"Yeah, I unsubscribed thinking it was like,"
4774660,4776700," I was accidentally subscribed to Tesla or something."
4776700,4779540," I didn't even realize that it was LTT that I was unsubscribing from."
4779540,4781020," I'm sitting here going, \"Okay."
4781020,4782180," How many of those people are there?"
4782180,4785380," What's the most effective way to reach them and get them back?\""
4785380,4786380," And so I'm going, \"Okay."
4786380,4787380," No."
4787380,4793140," We must come hell or high water, make a video about this hijacking while the momentum"
4793140,4798060," is still on our side on Reddit and on the LTT forum on Twitter and the community where"
4798060,4801900," people are still wanting to know, \"How do I upload my video about this before ****ing"
4801900,4802900," Asmon Gold?\""
4802900,4803900," Right?"
4803900,4807500," I mean, I'm not going to beat Moist critical."
4807500,4808500," Okay?"
4808500,4810500," Yeah, he's going to have it over right away."
4810500,4814740," Yeah, but if I can beat ****ing Asmon Gold to reporting on my own situation, then that's"
4814740,4817140," probably a good thing."
4817140,4818140," Right?"
4818140,4821380," So I'm kind of like, \"Okay."
4821380,4824500," Here's this outline I wrote in the wee hours of the morning."
4824500,4826140," I cannot write this video."
4826140,4828020," I need you guys to go fill in these blanks."
4828020,4829140," I left some blanks."
4829140,4833140," I passed that off to James and Jake, who apparently also shared the load with Luke."
4833140,4835900," I didn't even know, by the way, that you had a writing credit on it until you told me"
4835900,4836900," this now."
4836900,4841460," I don't even necessarily think I should have jaked it massively, massively more than I"
4841460,4842460," did."
4842460,4845860," Then Jake brings me the script once I'm done."
4845860,4849060," And I basically sit there and I full credit to Jake."
4849060,4850780," Everything you did was great."
4850780,4851780," But the problem was that..."
4851780,4854180," I did notice it was a bit different."
4854180,4855420," Yeah."
4855420,4859220," The problem was that I do edit our scripts."
4859220,4862380," And I was not in a state of mind where I was really able to edit."
4862380,4863580," So I sat with him for a little bit."
4863580,4867660," I went through the technical parts, making sure that anything because this session token"
4867660,4872020," thing is something I just learned about, it's not like I didn't know what a session token"
4872020,4875060," was, but just the exact mechanism of the hijacking."
4875060,4876380," I wasn't familiar with it."
4876380,4879460," You need to make sure you get these things right as much as you at least freaking can,"
4879460,4880460," right?"
4880460,4881460," Crisis mode."
4881460,4885300," So I basically went through, okay, so here's these details that I need to go through."
4885300,4888460," Get the f*** out of my office in the nicest possible."
4888460,4891820," I was like, \"Look, I don't think I can review someone else's work right now."
4891820,4896380," I think I'm better off putting in my headphones and just banging this out myself.\""
4896380,4900980," You get to the survival mode function through your brain or still running."
4900980,4903340," So you can still dial in on a single task."
4903340,4906060," But you can't, like the other stuff starts to fade."
4906060,4907060," It starts to fall away."
4907060,4912420," I can't have someone next to me right now, like discussing this with me because normally"
4912420,4916220," that's how we would go through and do script review because that's how we end up with our"
4916220,4920500," best work is me and the writer sitting and collaborating on it."
4920500,4924380," And we did that for a while and I was just like, it's not that your ideas are bad or"
4924380,4926060," that the work you've done is bad or anything."
4926060,4927740," I just can't do this right now."
4927740,4931180," And I need to just focus because this video must come up."
4931180,4934740," Poor Hoffman was here editing until like after midnight, I think."
4934740,4936460," I was going to ask who did that."
4936460,4938460," The Hoffman superstar."
4938460,4943100," Yeah, so there's one step that you don't know about."
4943100,4949340," So that message where you decided, I don't think I necessarily even got it."
4949340,4950340," I don't know."
4950340,4952420," I got a lot of messages."
4952420,4955300," The message where you decided like, \"Okay, no, this isn't Saturday's video anymore."
4955300,4956940," This is now today's video.\""
4956940,4959940," We had to totally change the plan."
4959940,4965420," Because I had stuff like I wanted a thing in there where we showed like someone trying"
4965420,4967740," to get into their apartment building."
4967740,4970540," Oh, like B-roll and like."
4970540,4971540," We had all these different things."
4971540,4976020," Oh, Jake wanted to get the compromised machine and the account opened back up and get the"
4976020,4977940," exact email for screenshots."
4977940,4981820," Oh, yeah, I was like, \"Nah, we got to strike while the iron's hot.\""
4981820,4987980," But what I'm saying is we had one direction and then we had to like change it pretty significantly."
4987980,4993180," So most of my contributions were to the first direction and then Jake had to like redo basically"
4993180,4997420," the whole thing and I had to take off because there's too many other things going on."
4997420,5004700," But yeah, what you were saying about like task delegation and stuff, my biggest goal was"
5004700,5010420," the show's got to go on and by that I mean like the company needs to keep working."
5010420,5014020," So I was like, \"Okay, I'm getting offers for help from everyone on the planet, which"
5014020,5015940," I very much appreciate."
5015940,5016940," Thank you very much."
5016940,5017940," That's very cool.\""
5017940,5024660," But I actually need all of you to keep doing your jobs and I need like this small team"
5024660,5028100," of people which ended up mostly just being the people that I normally work with, which"
5028100,5029100," is great."
5029100,5030100," Yeah."
5030100,5033300," Need to like hammer this as hard as we can to try to solve things without disrupting too"
5033300,5036780," many other people's, you know, flows and whatnot."
5036780,5037780," So that was perfect."
5037780,5040340," That you went into like production mode."
5040340,5042940," That was exactly what I was hoping you would do."
5042940,5049340," If we can have a handle on everything else and you can keep doing that, that's the right"
5049340,5050340," move."
5050340,5051340," That's what we got to do."
5051340,5052340," Yeah, exactly."
5052340,5053340," So like I was totally on board."
5053340,5055340," Hey, we still shot six videos this week, which is LTT Florida."
5055340,5059420," I heard you talking to probably James about that and you were like, \"Hey, that's actually"
5059420,5060420," pretty good.\""
5060420,5062260," It's a pretty big W all things considered."
5062260,5063900," Yeah, it's actually pretty crazy."
5063900,5065380," Oh, I forgot."
5065380,5068140," At some point I went into CEO mode."
5068140,5069140," Oh, right."
5069140,5073180," I remember I was sitting on the set waiting for the shoot with the viewer."
5073180,5077780," I was actually a little bit early to the office because Yvonne did not want to nap for 45"
5077780,5078780," minutes."
5078780,5081500," I really did after dropping the kids off, but before going to work."
5081500,5083220," I don't want to go to it."
5083220,5087580," So I was sitting on set and you know, catching up on, right?"
5087580,5089420," Because I had stuff to do."
5089420,5090300," But then I was like, \"Oh, crap."
5090300,5093260," I should really like send out, you know, something.\""
5093260,5098100," We had already sent a message much earlier in the morning going, \"Hey, there's a situation.\""
5098100,5102340," I went into CEO mode and I basically wrote like a Q&A, a Q&A post."
5102340,5104140," Oh, this was a really good write up."
5104140,5109780," I mean, when I'm not being distracted, like- You can do it."
5109780,5111140," Yeah, I'm in the zone."
5111140,5114380," So I'm just like, \"Hey, all I know from your one on ones that you prefer getting updates"
5114380,5116100," about this sort of thing on WAN show.\""
5116100,5117100," Oh, not really."
5117100,5120660," But not everyone has a float plane account, so it won't be possible to reach you all like"
5120660,5121660," that."
5121660,5125140," I'll settle for a post on Teams and basically went through, \"Okay, what happened?"
5125140,5126300," What's being done to fix it?"
5126300,5127820," What does it mean?"
5127820,5128820," Some good stuff."
5128820,5134420," I should be more updates over the course of the rest of the day, maybe into tomorrow.\""
5134420,5139180," And then I fell asleep in my chair, which obviously James took a picture of."
5139180,5141340," Okay, so I was going to ask, is that that moment?"
5141340,5142340," That is not staged."
5142340,5146220," So wait, the laptop, you lit it."
5146220,5148460," Write that post, enter gone."
5148460,5151980," I was out for probably about half an hour in that chair."
5151980,5152980," That's awesome."
5152980,5154140," Yeah, I mean, it's a framework laptop."
5154140,5155300," So if it falls, who cares?"
5155300,5159140," I'll just fix it."
5159140,5163140," I tried to sleep two times."
5163140,5168420," The first time I think was when I sent..."
5168420,5172220," Was this in?"
5172220,5174060," No."
5174060,5176780," The first time was just in a lull of stuff."
5176780,5182100," There was something that I could do, like, yeah, I didn't get to do my normal job that"
5182100,5183100," day."
5183100,5184100," Yeah."
5184100,5185100," I didn't get to do my job that day."
5185100,5186100," I didn't get to do my job that day."
5186100,5187100," I didn't get to do my job that day."
5187100,5188100," I didn't get to do my job that day."
5188100,5189100," I didn't get to do my job that day."
5189100,5190100," I didn't get to do my job that day."
5190100,5191100," I didn't get to do my job that day."
5191100,5192100," I didn't get to do my job that day."
5192100,5193100," I didn't get to do my job that day."
5193100,5194100," I didn't get to do my job that day."
5194100,5195100," I didn't get to do my job that day."
5195100,5196100," I didn't get to do my job that day."
5196100,5197100," I didn't get to do my job that day."
5197100,5198100," I didn't get to do my job that day."
5198100,5199100," I didn't get to do my job that day."
5199100,5200100," I didn't get to do my job that day."
5200100,5221100," I didn't get to do my job that day."
5221100,5228100," I didn't get to do my job that day."
5228100,5235100," I didn't get to do my job that day."
5235100,5242100," I didn't get to do my job that day."
5242100,5249100," I didn't get to do my job that day."
5249100,5256100," I didn't get to do my job that day."
5256100,5263100," I didn't get to do my job that day."
5263100,5270100," I didn't get to do my job that day."
5270100,5277100," I didn't get to do my job that day."
5277100,5284100," I didn't get to do my job that day."
5284100,5291100," I didn't get to do my job that day."
5291100,5298100," I didn't get to do my job that day."
5298100,5305100," I didn't get to do my job that day."
5305100,5312100," I didn't get to do my job that day."
5312100,5319100," I didn't get to do my job that day."
5319100,5326100," I didn't get to do my job that day."
5326100,5333100," I didn't get to do my job that day."
5333100,5340100," I didn't get to do my job that day."
5340100,5347100," I didn't get to do my job that day."
5347100,5354100," I didn't get to do my job that day."
5354100,5361100," I didn't get to do my job that day."
5361100,5368100," I didn't get to do my job that day."
5368100,5375100," I didn't get to do my job that day."
5375100,5382100," I didn't get to do my job that day."
5382100,5389100," I didn't get to do my job that day."
5389100,5396100," I didn't get to do my job that day."
5396100,5403100," I didn't get to do my job that day."
5403100,5410100," I didn't get to do my job that day."
5410100,5417100," I didn't get to do my job that day."
5417100,5424100," I didn't get to do my job that day."
5424100,5431100," I didn't get to do my job that day."
5431100,5438100," I didn't get to do my job that day."
5438100,5445100," I didn't get to do my job that day."
5445100,5449100," They weren't able to do it themselves for some legal reason."
5449100,5460100," As far as my brain guessing can confirm, I'm assuming it's because if they publish something on your behalf, it's them publishing it."
5460100,5461100," Yes."
5461100,5462100," So there's issues with that."
5462100,5466100," We had to be the ones that actually did it, but they really extremely helpful in walking us through."
5466100,5469100," This is crazy."
5469100,5477100," Because I've been dealing with it and not reading articles about it, the amount of coverage there has been."
5477100,5479100," Oh, wait."
5479100,5481100," What did I just show?"
5481100,5482100," I don't even know."
5482100,5486100," I pressed Linus laptop, but my HDMI is unplugged."
5486100,5490100," I don't know what that was, but hopefully nothing."
5490100,5491100," It was nothing."
5491100,5492100," Good."
5492100,5493100," Cool."
5493100,5494100," Thanks, Dan."
5494100,5495100," Good to know."
5495100,5498100," He'd say that anyway."
5498100,5499100," I'm doing it."
5499100,5501100," I'm plugging it into the door."
5501100,5502100," Well, is it going to work?"
5502100,5503100," Just hold on."
5503100,5504100," Yeah."
5504100,5505100," Wait."
5505100,5506100," All right."
5506100,5507100," Cool."
5507100,5508100," I will be in a second and Dan will fix it."
5508100,5509100," Oh, yeah."
5509100,5510100," But there's tons of it."
5510100,5511100," It's crazy."
5511100,5512100," Okay."
5512100,5519100," So Lou from Unbox Therapy has 17,000 views on a stark warning after hack."
5519100,5521100," I don't even think that's the only clip he did about it."
5521100,5531100," A review tech USA has 73,000 views on a video."
5531100,5533100," Sam time is 18,000."
5533100,5537100," John Hammond, 75,000 mental outlaw, 236,000."
5537100,5538100," Muda Har, Madhar."
5538100,5539100," Oh, sorry."
5539100,5540100," You know what?"
5540100,5542100," Some ordinary gamers, 441,000."
5542100,5543100," Oh, yeah."
5543100,5545100," Here's Lou's other video, 132,000."
5545100,5550100," Chris Titus tech 56 UFD tech, 327,000."
5550100,5551100," Everywhere."
5551100,5554100," Like trying to get more information about what's going on."
5554100,5560100," And like, I'm sitting here going, okay, I guess I probably should have posted some stuff about"
5560100,5561100," it."
5561100,5563100," The one place I posted was on Flowplane."
5563100,5564100," Oh, yeah."
5564100,5567100," And I posted a tech step to, oh, no, I guess I posted on Twitter as well."
5567100,5568100," Just to say, I know."
5568100,5570100," So people would stop messaging."
5570100,5574100," This is what I was going to say though about like the show's got to go on."
5574100,5576100," It's like all the different teams."
5576100,5577100," Like, I don't know."
5577100,5581100," I've been out of Linus Media Group for a while."
5581100,5582100," Yeah."
5582100,5584100," And I've been out of office for a while."
5584100,5585100," Wait, Ludwig has a video?"
5585100,5586100," Yeah."
5586100,5588100," Oh, he didn't put my name in the title."
5588100,5589100," I guess I wasn't."
5589100,5590100," He put your face there."
5590100,5592100," I wasn't keyword worthy enough."
5592100,5594100," 1.1 million views."
5594100,5595100," All right."
5595100,5596100," What was I going to say?"
5596100,5597100," Yeah."
5597100,5601100," So I've been in my little like, you know, developer bubble for a while."
5601100,5602100," Yeah."
5602100,5606100," Coming back in though, watching the machine churn is very interesting."
5606100,5607100," It churns fast now."
5607100,5608100," And like churns fast."
5608100,5612100," The social team is like all over this immediately, right?"
5612100,5614100," That was one of the interesting things to me."
5614100,5618100," It's like, okay, yeah, we got obliterated, but the show's got to go on."
5618100,5620100," So social team is like making memes about it."
5620100,5621100," Yeah."
5621100,5627100," That was a big part of my like message from the CEO was the best FU that we can give to the"
5627100,5630100," hijackers is to not have any interruption to our business."
5630100,5631100," That's cool."
5631100,5634100," And the social team went hard."
5634100,5635100," Oh, yeah."
5635100,5637500," They went like savage in some cases."
5637500,5639460," They went really hard."
5639460,5641540," Some of the memes though are great."
5641540,5645740," And I can only take the tiniest amount of credit for it."
5645740,5651620," The only thing I did is I wrote the caption for the one with me asleep in the chair."
5651620,5656420," I did pretty good there, but I got to give James credit, not even the social team, but"
5656420,5660460," you got to give James credit for being on the ball, seeing me asleep when he was to call"
5660460,5667060," me to set and instead of waking me, snapping a pic, you can tell that boy has gone to some"
5667060,5668060," frat parties."
5668060,5669060," Yeah."
5669060,5672460," Am I allowed to share my laptop screen now?"
5672460,5673460," Okay."
5673460,5674460," Yep."
5674460,5675460," Cool."
5675460,5676460," All right."
5676460,5678780," So man, these guys, these guys were on it."
5678780,5682620," Oh, so and there's so many posts and that's definitely like what we should have done."
5682620,5683620," And these are amazing."
5683620,5688100," Usually being the chair has like almost 64,000 likes when it's you 2.8 million."
5688100,5691460," Yeah, this this this runescape one."
5691460,5692460," So funny."
5692460,5693460," So good."
5693460,5694460," Oh man."
5694460,5695460," Like just shout out."
5695460,5696460," Okay."
5696460,5699380," This one didn't get the most interaction, but I thought it."
5699380,5702620," This is the one that made me laugh the hardest."
5702620,5706580," That was a that was a MAC address to eat."
5706580,5707580," Yeah."
5707580,5713500," Which was like that's that's the time to roast, you know, right?"
5713500,5714820," I look really tall here."
5714820,5716580," I definitely like that."
5716580,5718900," Um, what else we got?"
5718900,5720100," We still have jobs."
5720100,5721100," Great."
5721100,5722860," Today seems like a great day to watch short circuit."
5722860,5723860," That was funny."
5723860,5729140," I don't know if it's still this way, but the forum, um, the forum, there's like, there's"
5729140,5732260," like a sidebar on the forum that links to different videos that we have from different"
5732260,5733260," channels."
5733260,5734260," I did."
5734260,5735260," It was all short circuit."
5735260,5736260," It was all just like, yeah, okay, it's fixed."
5736260,5737260," It's fixed."
5737260,5741980," Um, but I mean when, you know, that's like, it turns into just like the, the Jake's most"
5741980,5745580," recent video from short circuit column, which was just so funny."
5745580,5746580," I don't know."
5746580,5747980," It was, it was even nice."
5747980,5752900," Like my, my group of people was heading the flame the whole time."
5752900,5755980," So every once in a while, when you come up for air and there's just something that you"
5755980,5756980," can laugh at."
5756980,5757980," It's funny."
5757980,5758980," Yeah."
5758980,5759980," It's like, oh, that's nice."
5759980,5760980," And then you can get back to it."
5760980,5761980," Exactly."
5761980,5767780," The float plane team for like almost entirely unrelated reasons, which is unfortunate because"
5767780,5773660," we genuinely are rock solid, the vast, vast, vast majority of the time, but we're trying"
5773660,5776460," to push this like really aggressive."
5776460,5777460," And you know what?"
5777460,5778660," Let me check really quick."
5778660,5783580," I'm going to potentially announce something."
5783580,5786660," I just want to make sure that we're going."
5786660,5789060," Oh boy."
5789060,5790060," We are."
5790060,5792060," Let's send it."
5792060,5796340," We, we for a long time haven't launched a ton feature wise."
5796340,5802300," There's a lot of reasons for that, but massive new thing is on the way and it's on the beta"
5802300,5803300," site."
5803300,5805900," It's beta.floatplane.com."
5805900,5808820," And there's a lot of big changes with it."
5808820,5810940," A big one is creator sub channels."
5810940,5815460," This is like the main, the main thing that we're talking about is creator sub channels."
5815460,5818140," And you can check that out if you were subscribed to Linus Tech Tips."
5818140,5819540," This is still in beta."
5819540,5824500," So not all the other creators or none of the other creators have like set their channels"
5824500,5828980," up for this or gone to all that kind of stuff, but they will be, will be working on it."
5828980,5831740," But you can, you can see all these different."
5831740,5835500," You can see we're still getting our processes figured out in terms of uploading."
5835500,5837660," Mac address accidentally uploaded as Linus Tech Tips."
5837660,5838660," We'll get that fixed."
5838660,5841220," Yeah, there's, there's, you know, there's things going on."
5841220,5843860," Also we're still kind of figuring our stuff out."
5843860,5846260," Sorry, there are still some problems on the beta site."
5846260,5847580," It is a beta site."
5847580,5852740," So, you know, it's kind of, bar for the course, but it's all broken up into these different"
5852740,5853740," sub channels."
5853740,5858180," So we, we got a lot of feedback that people didn't like typing in the word exclusive if"
5858180,5860500," they wanted to search for all the exclusives on the site."
5860500,5864060," So that's kind of where this concept comes from is there's a sub channel for exclusives."
5864060,5865500," So you just click on that."
5865500,5867620," It has its own branding, all that kind of stuff."
5867620,5868620," It's nice."
5868620,5871420," You can now collapse the sidebar, which we got a bunch of feedback for."
5871420,5875860," The player, not the full player update that we were hoping for like a long time ago, but"
5875860,5877340," the player does do more stuff."
5877340,5880740," You can, you can pop it out and then do other things on your computer and have it follow"
5880740,5887780," you around or it will more aggressively attempt to fill the screen, which is also kind of"
5887780,5888780," cool."
5888780,5890060," There's other little updates, stuff like that."
5890060,5891780," So that's, that showed up."
5891780,5894380," There's also tons of other things changing in the back end and the front end and the"
5894380,5896540," app and all this kind of stuff."
5896540,5898740," All of that was happening right now."
5898740,5899740," Yeah."
5899740,5900740," Cool."
5900740,5902900," One of the major things that happened was we launched an app update."
5902900,5905700," I'm pretty sure it was Monday."
5905700,5910500," It finished propagating right around when all of this happened and it had a little problem"
5910500,5914420," in it, which wouldn't have probably been that bad, but you know, because of all the"
5914420,5917780," other events going on, it was like the world's worst possible timing."
5917780,5923420," So AJ and Jonathan and Jaden and Joe and everybody is like trying to put out every"
5923420,5924700," fire on the planet."
5924700,5929340," Jaden's got this like whack-a-mole hammer and just going through batch and every single"
5929340,5933020," bug you can possibly find and everyone else is doing things."
5933020,5937580," It was, there's that whole like misery loves company thing."
5937580,5942020," And I don't necessarily think this was misery because I had a wonderful time, but it's"
5942020,5944980," like dumpster fires like dumpster fires."
5944980,5949420," The plane starts having issues for like realistically the first time in a long time."
5949420,5952060," The server has like an SSD go out."
5952060,5953540," Oh my God."
5953540,5955260," Like that's crazy."
5955260,5959100," All the different things that like this is really like never a problem."
5959100,5961780," And then just all of a sudden it's like boom, boom, boom, boom, boom."
5961780,5963460," And when it rains and pours, right?"
5963460,5965380," Everything possible just going off."
5965380,5969100," It was, it was crazy, but yeah."
5969100,5970820," Did we miss anything?"
5970820,5977260," I mean, we missed one big question that I got from someone, I don't know, like an hour"
5977260,5979060," ago."
5979060,5981980," Who edited naked liners?"
5981980,5983860," Whose job was it to censor?"
5983860,5985020," Well, I guess."
5985020,5986500," And the answer is Dennis."
5986500,5987500," Okay."
5987500,5988500," Yeah."
5988500,5989500," I was going to say traditionally it's Dennis."
5989500,5990500," So did he."
5990500,5991500," Traditionally."
5991500,5995660," Did he, did he, well someone asked me they were like, well, I can't believe someone had"
5995660,5997260," to edit naked liners."
5997260,6002540," And I was like, yeah, it wasn't the first time probably won't be the last."
6002540,6004300," And it's always been Dennis as far as I know."
6004300,6008340," The reason Dennis has ended up with naked footage of me is not because I sent it to him"
6008340,6013020," knowingly, but because Dennis keeps sneaking into my house and then taking security footage"
6013020,6014740," off of my cameras."
6014740,6019100," So occasionally I might be naked in my own damn house."
6019100,6020700," So he's already seen it."
6020700,6026260," So yeah, so realistically, you know, that bandaid's already off."
6026260,6031700," But he did say that he has a technique now and he didn't need to see anything more."
6031700,6035140," And the technique is he blurs the whole screen."
6035140,6036500," Oh, and then like."
6036500,6042540," And then blurs less and less until he gets to, you know, minimal blur edge."
6042540,6043620," Yeah, that makes sense."
6043620,6044620," Yeah."
6044620,6045620," I liked the, the strawberry."
6045620,6046620," That was tasteful."
6046620,6047620," Yeah."
6047620,6048620," Yeah."
6048620,6049620," All right."
6049620,6050620," Yeah."
6050620,6051620," What else?"
6051620,6055340," I think that's, I think that's, I think that's mostly it, but my brain's fried."
6055340,6056820," So might have missed some."
6056820,6064300," I got to say it was, it was really incredible waking up this morning, seeing just everyone"
6064300,6069940," coming and watching the video, people still subscribing to floatplane by the hundreds."
6069940,6070940," Oh, yeah."
6070940,6073020," We're going to pass 40 K like on this stream probably."
6073020,6074020," Shut up."
6074020,6080660," Yeah, we're at 39,932."
6080660,6082860," We have gained 250 float planes."
6082860,6083860," Sitting here."
6083860,6084860," While we've been sitting here."
6084860,6088820," There's over 4,000 people watching live."
6088820,6090900," I heard that number a while ago."
6090900,6094340," So that might even be different at this point, but."
6094340,6095340," That's incredible."
6095340,6096340," You know what?"
6096340,6100940," I probably didn't hurt that I was, that was about two thirds, I think, of the exclusive"
6100940,6102660," content that we have on floatplane."
6102660,6106460," There's, I think it's like almost 300 or it's 250 or something."
6106460,6109700," There's well over 200 exclusive videos on the platform."
6109700,6110980," A lot of it's really good."
6110980,6111980," Yeah."
6111980,6116340," We're at the point now where there's so many floatplane subscribers that we can actually"
6116340,6121740," have a team of people who is dedicated to making videos just for them and creating content"
6121740,6122740," just for them."
6122740,6127460," I actually have some, I had some cool thoughts in my sort of chaos brain mode that I was"
6127460,6129100," in this morning."
6129100,6131740," One of the things that we're going to start doing on floatplane is uploading LMG clips"
6131740,6133900," because we're not going to do it right away."
6133900,6137500," But once we've got it to the point where you can enable and disable notifications per"
6137500,6141460," sub channel, I was, that was why we haven't been doing it because I was worried about"
6141460,6146540," just spamming with this extra, at one point we were uploading like 10 videos a week to"
6146540,6147540," LMG clips."
6147540,6150860," I'm like, I don't want to, I don't, we don't need to overwhelm people."
6150860,6152540," But now if you can turn it off, well, no problem."
6152540,6154900," We'll just start uploading to LMG clips."
6154900,6159940," And also this is hilarious way back in the day, the day, once upon a time, I pressed"
6159940,6160940," Luke."
6160940,6164580," I put a bunch of pressure on him to create a feature for floatplane called text posts"
6164580,6170020," and picture posts, which has gone largely unused at that time."
6170020,6173140," And I was like, hey, we could create a channel for them."
6173140,6175260," And then the social team could post all the memes over there."
6175260,6179660," So everyone on floatplane could have no reason whatsoever to ever leave floatplane."
6179660,6180660," It would be amazing."
6180660,6184420," And they could even post like, if we had like two or three versions of it or, you know,"
6184420,6188340," two or three captions, we could post, you know, some of the other ideas that we have."
6188340,6191860," Yeah, because that same feature allows for multiple pieces of content per post."
6191860,6192860," Yeah."
6192860,6195020," So it could stay in one post, just one notification."
6195020,6196020," That's a good feature."
6196020,6197020," You could see all the different stuff."
6197020,6199020," Don't use it."
6199020,6200020," We did."
6200020,6201660," We did technically your response."
6201660,6203900," I actually thought that was kind of interesting."
6203900,6210020," Your initial response to everything lighting up and you like the first reach out, you mentioned"
6210020,6213180," sorry, it's been a long, been a long bit."
6213180,6215300," Your first reach out was on floatplane, right?"
6215300,6216300," Yes."
6216300,6217300," And then it was just."
6217300,6219460," No, first I tweeted, I know."
6219460,6220460," I know."
6220460,6221460," Okay."
6221460,6224300," And then your first like longer one was on floatplane and it was a text post."
6224300,6228540," And I was like, wow, this is going to be the most like banger text post that's ever posted"
6228540,6229540," on this platform."
6229540,6230540," Yeah."
6230540,6233420," I don't even remember what I said."
6233420,6237380," The beta sites having some issues right now, but you know, it's a beta."
6237380,6241980," So if you're having some problems, just go on to the normal site and it should be okay."
6241980,6242980," Oh, wait."
6242980,6244340," Now I clicked on the stream."
6244340,6245820," I can't even find text."
6245820,6251740," I guarantee you that all my guys are super pissed at me right now."
6251740,6253540," Oh, for sending people to the beta site."
6253540,6258060," Yeah, because they were like emergency putting out fires."
6258060,6263700," He says every time you say beta dot floatplane.com, the CPU spikes."
6263700,6264700," Thanks, Jonathan."
6264700,6267140," Yeah, my bad."
6267140,6268140," I got it."
6268140,6270700," I was all like hyped up on floatplane doing sick."
6270700,6276940," And then I realized I realized we've never loaded it like this or we've never changed"
6276940,6282020," the load on it like this since the roast and especially the roast had preparation involved"
6282020,6283020," in stuff, right?"
6283020,6284700," This was this was out of nowhere."
6284700,6288660," And the oh no, apparently they're totally in."
6288660,6291020," They're like, no, go to beta dot floatplane.com."
6291020,6292020," Okay, sick."
6292020,6293660," Let's go."
6293660,6296140," It's having some issues, but I mean, again, it's a beta."
6296140,6298500," Who cares?"
6298500,6302980," But yeah, a lot of our problems are actually not related to the sudden load from all the"
6302980,6304300," new users."
6304300,6308820," It's this like insanely massive update that we're pushing."
6308820,6312060," And this whole beta site thing, like you'll notice if you log into the main site and you"
6312060,6313700," go to the beta, you don't have to log in again."
6313700,6314700," Yeah, that's cool."
6314700,6315900," It's sharing backend."
6315900,6316900," Right."
6316900,6319140," So a lot of the update was to backend."
6319140,6320140," Right."
6320140,6321420," So there's things that are affecting both of them."
6321420,6322420," Right."
6322420,6327460," Like this is, this is, we're actually, we, we can take this amount of users."
6327460,6328460," Right."
6328460,6332580," It's just actually other unrelated problems that just showed up at the worst possible"
6332580,6333580," time in history."
6333580,6334580," Cool."
6334580,6336020," But I mean, we're working on it."
6336020,6337020," We'll figure it out."
6337020,6339420," They're working on it laterally like right now."
6339420,6340820," So yeah."
6340820,6343420," That's what it is."
6343420,6346460," We should get cake for crossing 40,000."
6346460,6347460," Cake."
6347460,6349460," How do we get cake?"
6349460,6351220," It's, you have a producer."
6351220,6352220," It's 940."
6352220,6353220," I guess we're over."
6353220,6355420," There's a cake in my fridge."
6355420,6356700," Is there any way to obtain it?"
6356700,6358860," Like can you Uber eats from your house?"
6358860,6359860," Oh, like a home."
6359860,6360980," Can you send an Uber driver?"
6360980,6362700," You can do a delivery thing, I think."
6362700,6363700," To your house."
6363700,6364700," Hello."
6364700,6368780," Any Vaughn can put a cake in the car and then can the Uber bring it here?"
6368780,6370140," Is that a thing that can be done?"
6370140,6372660," There's Uber package delivery."
6372660,6375260," It's TNT mango fruit cake."
6375260,6376260," Would you eat cake?"
6376260,6379380," Because I know you're kind of, you know, iffy on the whole calories right now."
6379380,6381900," I was actually complaining to people about this earlier."
6381900,6383420," But have you eaten anything anyway?"
6383420,6385260," I haven't had, I have actually."
6385260,6386960," Oh, okay."
6386960,6390380," I haven't had sugary drinks in like a super, super long time."
6390380,6391380," Ooh."
6391380,6392900," I had two Red Bulls."
6392900,6396140," How was that for you?"
6396140,6398180," I'm like just disappointed?"
6398180,6399180," Mm."
6399180,6401420," Okay, so you're not going to have any cake?"
6401420,6402420," Probably not."
6402420,6403420," You can have cake."
6403420,6407420," No, I'm not going to eat cake in front of you."
6407420,6408980," I genuinely don't mind."
6408980,6409980," You can definitely have."
6409980,6411620," I'll eat the cake when you're not around."
6411620,6412620," I don't know if that's better."
6412620,6413900," Because I'm going to eat cake tonight."
6413900,6414900," No, that's great."
6414900,6416900," I'm going to be sitting naked."
6416900,6418900," Eating cake."
6418900,6419900," Sweet."
6419900,6426300," Dan, you can be there if you want."
6426300,6427300," Hell yeah."
6427300,6430300," Do you guys need food though?"
6430300,6431300," Seriously."
6431300,6435540," What I think we should do is get through some more of our tech topics, get through the sponsors"
6435540,6438260," and the LTT store stuff that we got to talk about."
6438260,6439260," Yeah, that's hilarious."
6439260,6440260," We can."
6440260,6441820," Because Dan's fingers are on fire."
6441820,6442980," Well, no, we actually--"
6442980,6446460," And we haven't even announced the new items on LTT store yet."
6446460,6447620," Oh, boy."
6447620,6449500," Well, yeah."
6449500,6451220," So we've set some records."
6451220,6455700," The merch message server exploded."
6455700,6458860," So Conrad and I have been dealing with that."
6458860,6461500," The backlog was about 200 for a little while there."
6461500,6463020," I would like to apologize to everyone."
6463020,6465660," I have read every single one of your merch messages."
6465660,6471100," The top remaining in the queue is an hour and 10 minutes for them all to be displayed"
6471100,6473100," down the bottom of the screen."
6473100,6476860," There's currently 343 in the queue."
6476860,6481940," We have had over 700 and have been live for just under two hours now."
6481940,6483940," We are not going to get to them all today."
6483940,6486820," Thank you for your support in advance."
6486820,6488820," We'll do what we can."
6488820,6489820," Yeah."
6489820,6493820," It's the shirt which I completely forgot about."
6493820,6494820," So--"
6494820,6495820," OK."
6495820,6499020," Because Conrad made this cool feature in the merch messages dashboard which tracks the"
6499020,6500820," most popular item of the night."
6500820,6502820," And it's the shirt."
6502820,6505100," Right."
6505100,6506580," That makes sense."
6506580,6507580," That makes total sense."
6507580,6508580," I haven't even seen it."
6508580,6509580," Have you seen it yet?"
6509580,6510580," I haven't seen it yet."
6510580,6511580," Would you guys like to see it?"
6511580,6512580," I'd like to see it but we're going to do our sponsors first."
6512580,6513580," Oh, OK."
6513580,6514580," All right."
6514580,6515580," All right."
6515580,6517060," Was Dennis involved?"
6517060,6518780," Dennis is involved."
6518780,6520940," Oh, bloody hell."
6520940,6524860," Do you not feel like I've gone through enough today?"
6524860,6526020," But Dan."
6526020,6534220," Well, I mean, it put me in a tough position too because normally I do these on Thursdays."
6534220,6535220," And I was--"
6535220,6541100," Anytime anyone would ask him to do anything yesterday, I would just be like, no."
6541100,6543980," Yeah, I think Adam came by and was like, how you guys doing?"
6543980,6547500," I went, don't talk to us today."
6547500,6549100," I apologize to him later."
6549100,6551780," Sorry, I was very short."
6551780,6553420," Yeah, so normally I do that on Thursday."
6553420,6555260," And it was getting near the end of the day."
6555260,6558940," And Sarah sends me a message on Teams."
6558940,6559620," Yeah."
6559620,6564220," Hey, Linus and Nick have asked me to do a stream tomorrow at 10."
6564220,6568700," And I think I said, is this a joke wall?"
6568700,6570780," I did not ask for the stream."
6570780,6574380," I think I asked for some kind of commemorative."
6574380,6576460," I was there for the hack shirt."
6576460,6577140," No."
6577140,6580900," No, I'm designing the shirt live on stream."
6580900,6585580," So I'm going to be there for another eight hours at 9 PM."
6585580,6587500," And then I have to be back here for 9."
6587500,6590740," And then we did a five hour stream."
6590740,6592260," So that stream finished--"
6592260,6593540," This all happened."
6593540,6595060," --3 PM today."
6595060,6600780," And then at 3 PM today, I had to do the entire 30 individual video"
6600780,6603580," integrations with like layered things."
6603580,6606380," I had to set up that call you had with those lovely people"
6606380,6612140," from DP review and implement the new like merch things"
6612140,6613980," that Conrad wrote this week."
6613980,6615900," Man, Dan, you must be so tired."
6615900,6617780," I think the kindest thing that I can do"
6617780,6620180," is to make it so we don't have to look at you being so tired"
6620180,6622020," like this."
6622020,6624140," I love working here."
6624140,6625580," Joey, do these integrations?"
6625580,6627060," Our competitors worked really hard on them."
6627060,6628620," Let's make some more money."
6628620,6629380," Let's go."
6629380,6633380," Oh, my goodness."
6633380,6634380," Our face hurts."
6634860,6638380," [LAUGHTER]"
6638380,6640300," This is Wancho Unhinged."
6640300,6647100," You got your script and things."
6647100,6648620," I mean, I don't have anything to do."
6648620,6649540," Oh, it's in the dark."
6649540,6652060," I've even looked at the dark in over an hour."
6652060,6652900," OK, I've got it."
6652900,6653580," I've got it."
6653580,6654900," OK, read the things."
6654900,6655900," I have nothing."
6655900,6659740," Do I start?"
6659740,6660580," I guess."
6660580,6662460," OK, our first sponsor is Goliath."
6663460,6664460," Thanks."
6664460,6665460," OK."
6665460,6667620," Tired of dealing with the hassle of--"
6667620,6669540," the hassle of-- oh, wow, I can't do this."
6669540,6672820," The hassle of Citrix or VMware Horizon issues"
6672820,6674900," look no further than Goliath."
6674900,6677940," They offer a stress-free solution to end user experience"
6677940,6679380," monitoring and troubleshooting."
6679380,6682820," They can help you fix the most complex Citrix or VMware"
6682820,6685380," Horizon user issues in minutes."
6685380,6688660," With Goliath, you can kiss your-- oh, my God."
6688660,6691380," Your IT issues, goodbye."
6691380,6692980," But that's not all."
6692980,6695260," Get a troubleshooting expert out of the box."
6695260,6698660," So even if you're not tech savvy like Dennis, what?"
6698660,6702260," You can still resolve issues without escalating them further."
6702260,6704380," The technology comes with embedded intelligence"
6704380,6707660," and automation so you can be set up and get operating in minutes."

6718980,6722620," And with-- what is that kiss from?"
6722620,6724460," The kiss thing."
6724460,6725300," Seven."
6725300,6726460," What is that even from?"
6726460,6727300," Six."
6727300,6728420," Oh, OK."
6728420,6729140," Oh."
6729140,6730180," Oh, wow."
6730180,6730700," Oh."
6730700,6731140," Wow."
6731140,6732900," Yeah, that's uncomfortable."
6732900,6733620," OK."
6733620,6737100," The show is also brought to you by Ridge."
6737100,6739780," Do you have a big bold problem like this, man?"
6739780,6741140," Oh, my God."
6741140,6742500," Well, you do."
6742500,6746020," You just don't even realize."
6746020,6749140," On the left is your boring and chunky wallet."
6749140,6751180," On the right is the Ridge Wallet."
6751180,6753380," With the Ridge's compact and stylish designs,"
6753380,6756180," you can now walk around and sit in comfort."
6756180,6757860," The Ridge Wallet can hold up to 12 cards,"
6757860,6759740," plus having room for cash."
6759740,6761780," They have over 30 color and style variation,"
6761780,6764140," so you can easily find your perfect match."
6764140,6767660," And its RFID blocking technology can even prevent thieves"
6767660,6769700," from stealing your YouTube-- sorry, excuse me--"
6769700,6771740," your personal information."
6771740,6774020," What am I looking at?"
6774020,6775740," Where is the arm going?"
6775740,6776740," I don't get it."
6776740,6778540," You can test drive it for 45 days."
6778540,6783180," If you don't like it, just send it back for a full refund."
6783180,6786220," Today is the last day of their anniversary sale."
6786220,6791500," Thank you, Ridge, for sponsoring the show today."
6791500,6794900," They say pants-bulge sufferers should head to their website now."
6794900,6795700," There you go."
6795700,6798180," Save your pocket and save your wallet."
6798180,6801340," Finally, the show is brought to you by Squarespace."
6801340,6804860," Lots of things in life are hard."
6804860,6807220," It's just as hard as running your own business."
6807220,6809740," But you know what's not hard?"
6809740,6812180," Making your website with Squarespace."
6812180,6814180," You can grow your business online through their marketing"
6814180,6818060," features, including SEO support, email, campaigns,"
6818060,6819380," and social tools."
6819380,6821140," They have a wide selection of templates"
6821140,6822140," for your online store."
6822140,6824420," And their e-commerce platforms come with everything"
6824420,6826340," you need from merchandising to checkout."
6826340,6829540," If you need help, they offer webinars, guides, and 24/7 support"
6829540,6830460," team."
6830460,6831620," And we like them so much."
6831620,6833180," We use them."
6833180,6836620," We use them for our LTX2023 website, too."
6836620,6839260," So go check it out and get some tickets, by the way."
6839260,6841620," And head to squarespace.com/wann"
6841620,6843380," to get 10% off today."
6843380,6846620," Whew!"
6846620,6847620," OK."
6847620,6848580," Yeah, I did it."
6848580,6849460," How many top-- oh, wow."
6849460,6851820," There's like no topics today, but that probably makes sense."
6851820,6853420," I think we need to-- oh, yeah, it's"
6853420,6854740," going to be a long show anyways."
6854740,6856700," I think we need to look at this shirt, though."
6856700,6857620," OK."
6857620,6859180," I'm just too curious."
6859180,6861300," Are you guys ready to see this shirt?"
6861300,6862500," I kind of have to pee."
6862500,6864580," Is it because I need to see the shirt?"
6864580,6866060," Or OK, all right."
6866060,6867780," We're going to be here all night, so go pee."
6867780,6868140," You know what?"
6868140,6869860," Yeah, yeah, I'm going to do that."
6869860,6871180," Do you want to send me--"
6871180,6873060," is there merch messages that I can answer, Dan?"
6873060,6873980," And while you--"
6873980,6875740," Why don't you talk about the bug that"
6875740,6878300," allows users to un-sensor images?"
6878300,6878820," Sure."
6878820,6879980," Do a tech topic."
6879980,6881180," Not with AI."
6881180,6884300," This isn't like AI magically reconstructing the image"
6884300,6884820," somehow."
6884820,6886300," This is actually terrible."
6886300,6887180," Pencils."
6887180,6887660," Where is it?"
6887660,6888020," Here it is."
6888020,6888460," Yeah."
6888460,6891820," So this was posted by a bunch of places."
6891820,6893420," This was all over the-- the Twitter's."
6893420,6895060," It was apparently posted by 9 to 5."
6895060,6897020," Google was posted by the Verge."
6897020,6900100," Google's March security update fixed a bug"
6900100,6903780," in the Pixel markup tool that allowed partial recovery"
6903780,6906860," of information that had been cropped or censored"
6906860,6908020," from a screenshot."
6908020,6911420," This typically resulted when an image was saved in the tool,"
6911420,6914380," edited, and then the new version was saved in the same file"
6914380,6915860," location as the original."
6915860,6918780," The edited file is typically smaller than the original,"
6918780,6922140," meaning that it wouldn't save over the entirety"
6922140,6923740," of the original information."
6923740,6926660," That excess information was then retained"
6926660,6929700," instead of being deleted from the file location."
6929700,6933660," It's worded."
6933660,6935060," Yeah, sorry."
6935060,6937060," This revelation prompted researchers"
6937060,6938740," to check other similar tools."
6938740,6941300," I'm happy this is in the notes because I wasn't sure"
6941300,6944220," because this was really interesting."
6944220,6948500," Microsoft appears to have made an almost identical mistake,"
6948500,6952540," which the same vulnerability is able to be exploited on it"
6952540,6953460," to be clear."
6953460,6956580," So it's like the same thing in both the Windows 11"
6956580,6960260," Snipping tool and Windows 10 Snipping Sketch."
6960260,6963540," I believe there was also another thing as well."
6963540,6967220," This is definitely still kind of like a evolving topic."
6967220,6969660," So look into the amount of different devices and services"
6969660,6970780," if you're interested."
6970780,6974820," Luckily, many online services reprocess uploaded images"
6974820,6977300," absolutely because they want to save data."
6977300,6979540," Rendering this information unrecoverable,"
6979540,6981220," but not all of them do."
6981220,6985060," Discord, for example, only started reprocessing uploaded images"
6985060,6986980," in January of this year."
6986980,6991180," Images uploaded and sent prior to said patches"
6991180,6994460," may still carry this vulnerability."
6994460,6996020," Pretty crazy."
6996020,6997820," Discussion question, this is a serious problem,"
6997820,7002220," but it appears to happen in extremely specific circumstances."
7002220,7003700," How rich the average person be?"
7003700,7007060," I mean, if you use Snipping tool,"
7007060,7009780," Snipping tool is the most interesting one to me personally"
7009780,7011220," because of how I use devices."
7011220,7014020," I'm not sure if that's the same for how other people use devices,"
7014020,7017060," but how I use devices, Snipping tool,"
7017060,7023660," there's a lot of information that could potentially be there."
7023660,7025980," And how this does recover things."
7025980,7027180," Yeah, maybe you won't see all of it,"
7027180,7030540," but being able to see any amount of it is pretty concerning."
7030540,7033140," I mean, especially because Snipping tool is not,"
7033140,7036380," it's not a tool like, oh man, what's that one that I like"
7036380,7038740," that you can get on 9/8?"
7038740,7041380," I can't remember right now, but there's a screenshot."
7041380,7042380," A screenshot or something?"
7042380,7044100," Yeah, there's screenshotting tools"
7044100,7045820," that are inherently kind of less secure"
7045820,7047980," because by default they upload to image sharing sites"
7047980,7049900," like Imgur or whatever."
7049900,7052260," But Snipping tool, you kind of think of as--"
7052260,7053580," The more secure option."
7053580,7055620," Yeah, everything happening locally on your machine,"
7055620,7058020," and once you've edited it in any way,"
7058020,7060540," and sent it out, that's all they've got, right?"
7060540,7062340," Yeah."
7062340,7063260," Yeah, it's spooky."
7063260,7066420," There's also this whole security concept."
7066420,7067660," I don't remember what it's called."
7067660,7069420," I didn't prep for this."
7069420,7072300," But it's happening right now with certain bits of data"
7072300,7075260," that people think will be able to be cracked into using"
7075260,7076580," quantum computers."
7076580,7078300," It's happening with big governments and stuff"
7078300,7079900," where they're trying to harvest a bunch of stuff"
7079900,7082420," that they can't break into right now."
7082420,7083820," But they're storing it."
7083820,7085340," So they can break into it later."
7085340,7085860," Later."
7085860,7086740," This is a whole concept."
7086740,7089500," I don't remember what it's called, but there's a name for it."
7089500,7093060," And this feels like an almost potentially unintentional"
7093060,7094820," version of that."
7094820,7098460," Because upon hearing of this vulnerability,"
7098460,7101940," bad actors could just go back through conversations"
7101940,7105540," or look at things that were maybe shared with maybe"
7105540,7107980," communities or whatever and try to see me."
7107980,7109580," Oh, maybe I can extract something."
7109580,7111460," All that information's already out there,"
7111460,7114340," it's going to take the same amount of time"
7114340,7115860," for you to go back through everything"
7115860,7118060," you've shared as it is for them to go back."
7118060,7119740," So they might find something before you do."
7119740,7120460," Right."
7120460,7123340," Like, that's the concern to me is this is now"
7123340,7126980," a vulnerability for things that have been sent already."
7126980,7130780," The good news for me anyway is that's not how I use it."
7130780,7134340," So--"
7134340,7137500," I don't really crop images on my phone."
7137500,7140780," My trick is to just make sure that there was nothing bad there"
7140780,7142180," in the first place."
7142180,7143260," So--"
7143260,7143780," Yeah."
7143780,7144260," I mean--"
7144260,7145820," Like, something that I know a bunch of people do."
7145820,7147620," But like, if you need to screenshot a conversation"
7147620,7149860," and send it to someone, but you don't want the previous"
7149860,7152500," messages to come in, just open the keyboard."
7152500,7155020," And it shoves a bunch of the messages up."
7155020,7157180," So it'll get some stuff off screen and then screenshot it"
7157180,7157900," that way."
7157900,7159820," But yeah, I don't know."
7159820,7161420," Oh, holy crap."
7161420,7164020," I didn't even see this."
7164020,7167100," Intel founder Gordon Moore died earlier today"
7167100,7168740," at the age of 94."
7168740,7171180," Whoa."
7171180,7173220," Oh, wow."
7173220,7175420," One of the traders ate the programmers"
7175420,7178500," who left Shockley Semiconductor in 1957"
7178500,7181700," to launch the company that would eventually become Intel."
7181700,7185380," He's also the namesake of Moore's Law, obviously."
7185380,7187180," The rule of thumb that the number of components"
7187180,7189780," in an integrated circuit would double roughly every two years."
7189780,7192740," He only left the company in 1997."
7192740,7195860," Wow, so he was there for 40 years."
7195860,7197140," Absolutely incredible."
7197140,7202220," That's pretty wild."
7202220,7203100," I'm going to get it in."
7203100,7205380," It's going to be fast."
7205380,7207420," Oh, I'm doing it anyways."
7207420,7207980," OK."
7207980,7208420," They're big."
7208420,7209340," It's important."
7209340,7209860," All right."
7209860,7211660," So I'm going to take that along."
7211660,7213460," There's chat GPT updates."
7213460,7214620," OK."
7214620,7216860," OK."
7216860,7217620," Plugins."
7217620,7219340," It's actually huge."
7219340,7220860," Chat GPT is integrated plugins."
7220860,7222260," Have I had time to mess with this?"
7222260,7222760," No."
7222760,7224260," I was kind of dealing with some stuff."
7224260,7224900," OK."
7224900,7226380," So my information on this is not going"
7226380,7228140," to be as high quality as it normally is."
7228140,7229660," I'm just telling you it exists."
7229660,7231660," There's some really crazy things already."
7231660,7234700," The first thing I noticed was immediately on the plugin list."
7234700,7237660," So they were already working on this was Wolfram Alpha."
7237660,7239660," Do you know what Wolfram Alpha is?"
7239660,7243500," It's like you put in crazy complex equations"
7243500,7244940," and it just solves it for you."
7244940,7245980," Oh, OK."
7245980,7248260," You know what's interesting about chat GPT?"
7248260,7250580," It's always sucked at math."
7250580,7252020," No way."
7252020,7254140," They have a plugin for this thing that's"
7254140,7257380," like incredibly amazing at math."
7257380,7258580," So now it can do math."
7258580,7260380," And now you can talk to Wolfram Alpha."
7260380,7263860," I feel like I'm watching the Star Wars SQL Trilogy."
7263860,7264860," They fly now."
7264860,7265360," Yeah."
7265360,7268820," [LAUGHTER]"
7268820,7271220," Except this time, it couldn't already do it."
7271220,7274020," And not everyone knew that, which is crazy."
7274020,7276820," Sorry, I'm still salty about Star Wars."
7276820,7280500," But yeah, so Wolfram Alpha had a problem,"
7280500,7281940," if you want to call it this, where"
7281940,7285260," it doesn't understand like someone talking to it."
7285260,7285740," Right."
7285740,7288020," You have to do math with it."
7288020,7291300," And chat GPT had a problem where it can't really do math"
7291300,7292700," very well."
7292700,7296140," You push those two together, and that's crazy."
7296140,7299500," Because now you can ask in human language, conversational"
7299500,7301180," language, how to solve math problems,"
7301180,7304620," could introduce very, very complex math problems that Wolfram"
7304620,7308140," Alpha can then do for it and respond back"
7308140,7311180," in a conversational way, which is really interesting."
7311180,7315100," Also, it's on the internet now."
7315100,7318460," And it can do some pretty crazy stuff."
7318460,7319780," Because hey, it has plugins."
7319780,7323700," It's connected with Zapier, the automations"
7323700,7326980," and connect different accounts thing."
7326980,7330780," So people have connected like chat GPT to their email"
7330780,7333980," and had it read emails for them and do things with them"
7333980,7338460," and stuff, and download videos and edit them."
7338460,7340780," Don't know how much storage it has."
7340780,7343100," There's some actually really crazy stuff going on."
7343100,7346580," I've had zero time to touch it, zero time."
7346580,7347140," OK."
7347140,7351140," So yeah, it's another one of them weeks."
7351140,7352500," I don't know when this is going to stop."
7352500,7354660," Hey, I've got some big news for you too."
7354660,7356140," Did it just pass 40?"
7356140,7361300," Flowplane now has 40,106 subscribers for LTT."
7361300,7362340," What the heck?"
7362340,7363020," Wild."
7363020,7364940," That's actually insane."
7364940,7367740," There will be cake at some point, OK?"
7367740,7369220," We'll do a 40,000 cake."
7369220,7371140," I think I can-- yeah."
7371140,7374580," Dan, can you email Vance and ask Vance to arrange cake"
7374580,7376140," for next week, please?"
7376140,7377460," The week I'm not here."
7377460,7378860," Oh, not next week then."
7378860,7379460," Later."
7379460,7380420," No, later, later."
7380420,7381820," I'll have it done for Monday."
7381820,7383220," No, no, no, no, no, no."
7383220,7383740," Do it later."
7383740,7384220," Do it later."
7384220,7385220," Do it when you slept."
7385220,7386700," I wish all the Flowplane team was here,"
7386700,7388300," but so many of them are remote."
7388300,7389340," I know."
7389340,7390500," We can get them cake too."
7390500,7391700," Uber eats them cake."
7391700,7392220," Yeah."
7392220,7394460," Yeah, ask if Vance can arrange that."
7394460,7395900," Everyone should get cake."
7395900,7396420," I do have--"
7396420,7398940," Let them eat cake."
7398940,7400740," I do have Colton's credit card."
7400740,7401740," Oh, nice."
7401740,7403300," Put it on Colton's credit card."
7403300,7404780," Oh, I forgot."
7404780,7407820," When we went through the play by play, I was going to say,"
7407820,7410540," I don't want to name who it was, but in this case,"
7410540,7412340," let's just use the name Colton."
7412340,7412820," Yeah."
7412820,7415860," And just like, roast him indirectly, but I forgot."
7415860,7418020," I had some people that were actually"
7418020,7420220," upset with me for outing who it was,"
7420220,7423620," saying that that was a really not cool CEO move."
7423620,7425780," No, no, it was a joke."
7425780,7426380," It was a joke."
7426380,7427380," It wasn't Colton."
7427380,7431900," He actually addresses that in the Flowplane exclusive that"
7431900,7436140," day of staff reacting to hack memes."
7436140,7438180," So Colton's in that one."
7438180,7441660," And to be clear, I want to just do a really quick address"
7441660,7442940," for this."
7442940,7444980," It is not that person's fault."
7444980,7447180," There's a lot of things that--"
7447180,7447700," I don't know."
7447700,7449260," You talked about this in the video."
7449260,7450340," Stuff should roll up."
7450340,7450900," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
7450900,7451380," OK."
7451380,7452500," So I guess that's already covered."
7452500,7453340," That's the way it goes."
7453340,7455260," There's things-- we haven't had enough time."
7455260,7457740," And the infrastructure higher that I want to bring on"
7457740,7458780," isn't here yet."
7458780,7460820," I had interviews this week."
7460820,7463900," I had some earlier this week that went well enough."
7463900,7467300," And then I had some on Thursday and Friday scheduled."
7467300,7468260," Those didn't go as well."
7468260,7469580," Those got canceled."
7469580,7470700," And we moved those to next week."
7470700,7473260," You know what's really funny is Yvonne was also doing"
7473260,7476540," interviews this week for accounting positions."
7476540,7480060," And she fell asleep in one of them, which I think is"
7480060,7481340," hilarious."
7481340,7484380," I know that when she's not rested, she just--"
7484380,7485940," Yeah."
7485940,7486820," It's amazing."
7486820,7489460," It's like a superpower for her because we used to commute"
7489460,7492460," to university together on transit."
7492460,7498100," And she would not only usually be asleep within two stops"
7498100,7500500," on the train, like two."
7500500,7503820," And we got on at King George."
7503820,7505740," So that first one is really short."
7505740,7507780," It's from King George to Central City."
7507780,7508620," Almost immediate."
7508620,7509100," Yeah."
7509100,7509620," Yeah."
7509620,7512100," So she would pass out within two stops."
7512100,7517300," But once we would arrive, she would just wake up"
7517300,7518420," and keep going about it."
7518420,7521740," So she can drift in and out of sleep like a narcoleptic."
7521740,7523340," It's incredible."
7523340,7524780," I think that's the word for it, right?"
7524780,7526220," People who just fall asleep."
7526220,7526900," I think so."
7526900,7527820," I don't know either."
7527820,7528020," Yeah."
7528020,7530100," So anyways, she was telling me she fell asleep in one of her"
7530100,7530460," interviews."
7530460,7531860," And I was like, oh my goodness."
7531860,7534260," Well, did they understand the situation?"
7534260,7535460," Because she was saying, I fell asleep."
7535460,7537340," I want to email them and apologize."
7537340,7539340," And I'm like, well, I mean, did they understand the situation?"
7539340,7540620," And she was like, no, I didn't tell them."
7540620,7541460," And they didn't know."
7541460,7546260," Meanwhile, Luke's going, yeah, I tried to reschedule my"
7546260,7546580," interviews."
7546580,7548700," And they're like, yeah, we know it's all good."
7548700,7550460," Yeah, that was really funny."
7550460,7554060," The difference in these spaces and how people applying for"
7554060,7558620," that kind of a position are just jacked in."
7558620,7561460," They're dialed in to what's going on here."
7561460,7563420," I want to post a clarification because a bunch of people"
7563420,7565740," have been like, I jumped on chat, GPT and I asked it math"
7565740,7566740," stuff and it failed."
7566740,7568380," You have to be on a paid plan."
7568380,7570580," You have to have chat GPT plus because you need to be using"
7570580,7571820," GPT 4."
7571820,7573460," And you have to be in the--"
7573460,7576020," I don't know if this is the part where I don't know enough"
7576020,7576740," that's going on."
7576740,7580580," I know it's a beta, but I don't know if everyone's in or not."
7580580,7584460," And you have to enable the plugin for Wolfram Alpha."
7584460,7586860," It doesn't just do that normally."
7586860,7589820," There's a collection of plugins and you have to"
7589820,7590900," enable the plugin."
7590900,7591660," It's a wait list."
7591660,7592140," OK, yeah."
7592140,7593180," So not everyone can use it."
7593180,7594180," But it's doing these things."
7594180,7594940," You can look it up."
7594940,7596140," I don't have enough information."
7596140,7599380," Go to other more fleshed out resources."
7599380,7603100," Kyle from Creator Warehouse is freaking out in the chat or"
7603100,7604740," sending a message in the chat."
7604740,7608180," You guys forgot to update the Creator Warehouse stuff."
7608180,7609620," So let's go."
7609620,7610180," What creator?"
7610180,7611180," What?"
7611180,7613380," All the merch stuff that we're supposed to talk about this"
7613380,7615460," week that is all over the table in front of us."
7615460,7616340," And the shirt."
7616340,7617020," And the shirt."
7617020,7618020," There's so many things."
7618020,7618940," We didn't do the shirt yet."
7618940,7620060," You guys want to see the shirt?"
7620060,7621980," Yes, I'm going to see the bloody shirt."
7621980,7623180," All right, let's have a look at the bloody shirt."
7623180,7624180," Here we go."
7624180,7624700," Where do I see it?"
7624700,7625460," I am doing this."
7625460,7626300," This is a surprise."
7626300,7630340," All three people doing this show are extremely"
7630340,7631860," sleeved."
7631860,7636300," I had a lunch break today."
7636300,7639620," I worked through my lunch."
7639620,7641220," OK, you're not supposed to do that."
7641220,7641940," Wait, what?"
7641940,7646980," Let me just stop time."
7646980,7648300," All right, anyway, here's the shirt."
7648300,7649140," Are you guys ready?"
7649140,7649620," Wait a sec."
7649620,7650220," Yeah."
7650220,7651700," So wait, this is on the store."
7651700,7652860," Why don't we just look at it on the store?"
7652860,7654580," No, because it made a social talk."
7654580,7655580," OK, OK."
7655580,7656180," No, no, no, no."
7656180,7656660," Look it on."
7656660,7657940," I didn't see it."
7657940,7658300," OK, I'm--"
7658300,7660380," Here's the shirt."
7660380,7661340," Is it going to change colors?"
7661340,7661900," God."
7661900,7662220," Yeah."
7662220,7662980," Oh, perfect."
7662980,7664580," So I was going to say it should be like blue."
7664580,7666580," It's like, oh, that's so cool."
7666580,7669900," And here's a bigger version."
7669900,7670740," That's fantastic."
7670740,7671260," Awesome."
7671260,7674380," I saw a preview of this earlier."
7674380,7674820," So this is--"
7674820,7676340," Oh, there's a floor plate."
7676340,7677140," Heads up for that."
7677140,7678180," Let's go."
7678180,7680460," And if you look on the bottom left,"
7680460,7683900," there's a five-foot one on the talk."
7683900,7685300," I love this tattoo."
7685300,7686620," It's got a two F8 tattoo."
7686620,7687620," Love two F8."
7687620,7688420," Oh, that's fantastic."
7688420,7690020," Little basket of cookies."
7690020,7692900," Is the hat black?"
7692900,7695660," Well, we were considering a strawberry on the hat."
7695660,7696460," Oh, yes."
7696460,7696940," OK."
7696940,7699140," I think float planes idea as well."
7699140,7701500," Yeah, so this was a float-plane exclusive that"
7701500,7704140," was live for five hours straight today."
7704140,7704660," It's a--"
7704660,7706260," It's a basket of cookies."
7706260,7707780," Basket of cookies, yeah."
7707780,7708940," I just put that to the other eye."
7708940,7710500," I was like, if there's mushrooms or like--"
7710500,7712460," Getting cookies."
7712460,7716020," Wow, there's like so many cool elements to this design."
7716020,7717700," I love it."
7717700,7720660," Normally, I at least look at designs"
7720660,7724300," before we put them on sale, being the CEO and approving,"
7724300,7727020," especially if it's going to be poking fun at ourselves."
7727020,7729420," I kind of go, yeah, I'd probably be good if I get a chance"
7729420,7730580," to have a look at this a little bit."
7730580,7734060," But I don't think I would have had a single piece of feedback."
7734060,7734740," Here is."
7734740,7735340," Hold on."
7735340,7736340," That's awesome."
7736340,7736980," Oh, OK."
7736980,7737500," Put it on me."
7737500,7738380," Give me a second here."
7738380,7740780," Whoop."
7740780,7744700," I don't think I can live keep it color, but there you go."
7744700,7745420," Go on, fish."
7745420,7746220," Big on you."
7746220,7747620," There you go."
7747620,7748620," It's fair."
7748620,7750860," Yeah, that's actually-- that's not bad."
7750860,7752020," Here, wait, wait, wait."
7752020,7752900," There we go."
7752900,7753660," That's not bad."
7753660,7754180," There we go."
7754180,7754660," Awesome."
7754660,7755300," There's your shirt."
7755300,7757140," That's what--"
7757140,7758060," Live models."
7758060,7758580," OK."
7758580,7758860," OK."
7758860,7761900," And these are all on the new high quality LTT blanks."
7761900,7765860," The next thing, there are actually a few of these updates."
7765860,7767940," 64 ounce water bottles."
7767940,7769340," The chunguses."
7769340,7771420," Chung-ai?"
7771420,7772380," I like chung-ai."
7772380,7772900," Chung-ai."
7772900,7774940," The chung-ai are back in stock."
7774940,7777540," These things are absolutely enormous."
7777540,7779820," This is Luke's favorite now that he has one."
7779820,7780940," He's literally every day."
7780940,7781460," Yeah."
7781460,7782340," Good stuff."
7782340,7784140," These are back in stock on the site."
7784140,7786100," And I believe every color."
7786100,7788620," Certainly, most of the colors."
7788620,7790140," Oh, there are apparently new colors."
7790140,7791300," Hey, sick."
7791300,7792380," All right, those are back."
7792380,7795980," And we have a new underwear print for men"
7795980,7799860," and new women's underwear."
7799860,7801940," [HUMMING]"
7801940,7803500," Including--"
7803500,7804900," I don't know--"
7804900,7807580," if a thing exists, someone is into it."
7807580,7810580," Including a couples photo shoot that Ivan and I got to do"
7810580,7813060," together, which was actually pretty fun."
7813060,7816180," So the new colorway for the men's underwear--"
7816180,7818020," oh, where the bloody heck is the underwear."
7818020,7823380," This can't be that hard to find, right?"
7823380,7824140," OK, yes."
7824140,7824940," A lot of products now."
7824940,7825820," Hard weight."
7825820,7827180," Are these the old colorways?"
7827180,7832780," So the underwear got split out into more than one listing."
7832780,7833780," Mm."
7833780,7834780," OK."
7834780,7835620," I will--"
7835620,7837580," Conrad's going to feel so vindicated."
7837580,7838420," I will find it."
7838420,7840740," [LAUGHTER]"
7840740,7841700," Underwear three packs."
7841700,7843060," Oh, it's like confetti three pack."
7843060,7843660," Oh, OK."
7843660,7844180," OK."
7844180,7844700," OK."
7844700,7845220," OK."
7845220,7845700," All right, OK."
7845700,7846380," It just shows both."
7846380,7847300," So here it is."
7847300,7851940," And so we launched a new colorway for the men's."
7851940,7853460," And we launched women's underwear"
7853460,7856900," because the whole idea was we could do matching his and hers"
7856900,7860060," underwear."
7860060,7861420," Cool, right?"
7861420,7864060," OK, but I am actually confused."
7864060,7864660," OK."
7864660,7867580," So then there's four pieces for the women."
7867580,7868620," There's the scoop."
7868620,7869140," No, no, OK."
7869140,7872620," But the three pack evans in it."
7872620,7873140," Yeah."
7873140,7874460," But it's just a guy one."
7874460,7875580," Is that right?"
7875580,7876020," Yes."
7876020,7878980," Because she's in it and wearing the same style."
7878980,7880580," But this listing is--"
7880580,7881620," Oh, I see what you mean."
7881620,7883580," It could look like a three pack."
7883580,7884340," OK."
7884340,7886580," We will work on the clarity of that."
7886580,7888860," This is a three pack of men's underwear."
7888860,7892460," And then this is the matching women's sets."
7892460,7898820," So there's the triangle bralette in two different styles."
7898820,7903100," And then there's the boy short, the bikini something."
7903100,7905980," I don't really understand like women's undergarments."
7905980,7909820," But the point is that there's definitely undergarments."
7909820,7913060," And they're definitely matching his and hers."
7913060,7914740," And it was a lot of fun."
7914740,7916940," The second photo on the underwear three pack confetti"
7916940,7919700," prism slash black is hilarious."
7920700,7922700," I just love that."
7922700,7923700," That's so funny."
7923700,7925700," The expressions and everything."
7925700,7926700," It's just-- it's great."
7926700,7928700," We had a lot of fun with this."
7928700,7935700," I love the photo shoots that we do."
7935700,7938700," Because there's so many companies where you go to their brand photos."
7938700,7941700," It's just like, OK, they have that stock photo that they"
7941700,7943700," changed the logo on the shirt of or whatever."
7943700,7945700," And then ours, like, they just--"
7945700,7947700," everybody just like horses around, which is great."
7947700,7948700," I think it's great."
7948700,7950700," Well, you've got to put in the work, man."
7950700,7951700," Yeah."
7951700,7952700," And it's more interesting."
7952700,7955700," And you actually get to see people wearing them and trying them"
7955700,7958700," out instead of just this stock photo, which is clearly"
7958700,7960700," not that exact product."
7960700,7961700," Yeah."
7961700,7962700," Yeah."
7962700,7963700," Yeah, it sucks."
7963700,7964700," Sucks."
7964700,7965700," It's dumb."
7965700,7968700," Especially because it's like, not that much work."
7968700,7969700," Like it is."
7969700,7970700," We have a great team."
7970700,7971700," They do an amazing job."
7971700,7975700," Poor Maria, you know?"
7975700,7978700," We talk about Dantport Dennis having to censor naked Linus."
7978700,7983700," Maria has to hang around with me in my underwear,"
7983700,7985700," like taking pictures of me."
7985700,7989700," And it's like, OK."
7989700,7990700," Yeah."
7990700,7992700," Like, I don't know what to tell you."
7992700,7994700," Technically, it was in the job description."
7994700,7996700," So like, I guess this is what we're doing now."
7996700,7999700," Oh, I feel awkward about it."
7999700,8000700," Yeah."
8000700,8002700," I-- nothing against Maria."
8002700,8006700," I liked doing underwear shoots with Hoffman better just because,"
8006700,8007700," like, you know--"
8007700,8008700," Yeah, for both."
8008700,8009700," For both."
8009700,8010700," For both dudes."
8010700,8011700," We're both dudes."
8011700,8014700," It's like-- this is a very off topic."
8014700,8017700," But doing Jiu Jitsu for the first time is very similar."
8017700,8018700," Yeah."
8018700,8019700," Some of the-- some of the--"
8019700,8020700," Yeah."
8020700,8022700," -- their positions you got to get in sometimes."
8022700,8023700," Right."
8023700,8024700," It's like, this is--"
8024700,8025700," Right."
8025700,8026700," Yeah."
8026700,8027700," A lot of junk rubbing."
8027700,8028700," Yeah."
8028700,8029700," Yeah."
8029700,8030700," But then after you've, you know--"
8030700,8031700," Sure."
8031700,8032700," You're very focused on other things."
8032700,8034700," And it actually genuinely doesn't matter."
8034700,8035700," Yeah."
8035700,8036700," You just-- you just--"
8036700,8037700," do Jiu Jitsu and it's fine."
8037700,8039700," But the very first time, it's like, oh."
8039700,8041700," And credit to Maria, you know, total professional."
8041700,8042700," Very professional."
8042700,8043700," Yeah."
8043700,8044700," Yeah."
8044700,8045700," Total professional."
8045700,8046700," Very cool."
8046700,8047700," Definitely, you know, put me at ease."
8047700,8048700," That's good."
8048700,8049700," Just like, kind of-- it's a funny thing."
8049700,8050700," It's a moment."
8050700,8053700," Even though I wasn't showing any more skin than I would in a bathing suit."
8053700,8054700," It feels way more revealing."
8054700,8055700," Yeah."
8055700,8059700," Just like, undoing my belt in front of an employee."
8059700,8060700," Yeah."
8060700,8061700," That's a moment."
8061700,8062700," You know, right."
8062700,8065700," And like, I didn't, right."
8065700,8066700," Actually, no, I have."
8066700,8067700," Okay."
8067700,8069700," Like in, in, in, create a warehouse, like, merch meetings."
8069700,8070700," Like when I'm, okay."
8070700,8071700," Okay."
8071700,8072700," Okay."
8072700,8075700," A time I had to undo my belt in front of an employee, even though I didn't during the underwear shoot."
8075700,8080700," I changed outside and then I just came into my underwear, which was also walking into a room."
8080700,8082700," And like an employee's arm in my underwear."
8082700,8084700," You do what you can to make it less weird."
8084700,8085700," It's weird."
8085700,8090300," But a time I did have to undo my belt in front of someone was because I was, I was, we were"
8090300,8091860," working on a belt."
8091860,8098540," And so I was with Bridget, Alama Day and Nick, and I'm like, undoing my belt in front of"
8098540,8102300," them so that I can take it off and show them, you know, the issues I was having."
8102300,8103300," It was like a little thick."
8103300,8107300," And I was like, okay, yeah, I can't really thread it through here."
8107300,8111300," And like, it's like, but it's a really, it's not a thing I do."
8111300,8116300," Always only ever do either alone or an extremely selective company."
8116300,8117300," Yes."
8117300,8122860," And doing with other people, no matter how innocent, is just weird because your brain's"
8122860,8124540," like, this is different."
8124540,8125540," Yes."
8125540,8126540," Yeah."
8126540,8131300," Like I shouldn't be doing this because the things that come after this definitely shouldn't"
8131300,8132300," be done."
8132300,8134300," Because when do you take off your belt?"
8134300,8135300," Right."
8135300,8136300," You're going to take off your pants."
8136300,8139300," When you're going to have a shower when you're going to, you know, be banging or whatever,"
8139300,8140300," right?"
8140300,8141300," Like it."
8141300,8142300," But that's."
8142300,8143300," Yeah."
8143300,8144300," Yeah."
8144300,8145300," Anywho."
8145300,8149300," This may be the last win."
8149300,8154300," I am determined to cancel myself, have someone else cancel me."
8154300,8155300," Someone's got to do it."
8155300,8157300," This man must be stopped."
8157300,8161500," That tweet from the social team about like the second time in a month where everyone's"
8161500,8165980," wondering if they're going to still have a job was so funny."
8165980,8167940," Pretty on the nose social team."
8167940,8172300," I was going to say to how do we follow this up?"
8172300,8174180," The dance shows just been on fire."
8174180,8177300," That was another like pretty early reaction that I had when the channel got hacked."
8177300,8179340," I was like, when show's going to be sick."
8179340,8180340," Like there's no way."
8180340,8182060," My show isn't going to be great."
8182060,8184020," It's like, what do we do next week?"
8184020,8186060," We need something crazy to have."
8186060,8187060," No, I really don't."
8187060,8188380," I could actually use a break."
8188380,8189380," How about we just have a."
8189380,8190380," We'll think of something."
8190380,8193180," Can we do the night stream with a light song?"
8193180,8194180," Yeah."
8194180,8195180," And when you're not going to be here."
8195180,8196180," Oh, no."
8196180,8198020," I'm no longer allowed to ever miss a wanch."
8198020,8199020," Yeah."
8199020,8201260," Wait, are you joining the streak?"
8201260,8202580," I am joining the streak."
8202580,8204300," Dan's joining the streak."
8204300,8208860," Officially, it's part of my quarterly goal that there was no wanchows."
8208860,8213420," I got rid of the bugs that were in here for 10 years and now I'm going to die before"
8213420,8215540," there's another issue."
8215540,8216540," No way."
8216540,8218060," So hold on a second."
8218060,8220740," Which one of us is going to break the streak then?"
8220740,8224700," So is there a pool already that I just don't know about?"
8224700,8225740," I don't know of any."
8225740,8233300," I know I have stuff coming up that is going to be I'm going to be out of country on Fridays."
8233300,8236820," But I'm just like, I called in from France."
8236820,8238420," I called in from Greece."
8238420,8239980," I called in from Hawaii."
8239980,8241220," It doesn't mean it has to end."
8241220,8243260," I was talking to some people about this too."
8243260,8245820," I can technically do this job remotely."
8245820,8246820," Remote producing."
8246820,8250620," So you guys could be here and I can do all this remotely."
8250620,8251620," Right?"
8251620,8252620," Yeah."
8252620,8253620," So yeah, there's no."
8253620,8254620," There's no more."
8254620,8256700," There must go on."
8256700,8258220," All right."
8258220,8259220," Okay."
8259220,8260220," Ah, duh."
8260220,8261780," Yes, we're going to do it."
8261780,8262980," You're going to have another thing first."
8262980,8264540," I have another thing first."
8264540,8265540," Okay."
8265540,8272540," This is probably the last call for the CPU in a CPU promotion that we're doing."
8272540,8280900," We've got two pillows on LTT store that are on wild and crazy promo right now."
8280900,8283820," So the team read pillow."
8283820,8289540," This one right here in the 50 by 50 centimeter size has a chance."
8289540,8292180," I believe it's one in 23."
8292180,8294220," A one in 23 chance."
8294220,8295740," Don't quote me on that."
8295740,8298940," We'll have the full details on the product page, maybe."
8298940,8300020," I hope it's on the product page."
8300020,8301020," I will check the product page."
8301020,8302020," Yes."
8302020,8303020," Here it is."
8303020,8305660," One in a three and 25 chance."
8305660,8309020," So whatever that works out to 12 and 100."
8309020,8310020," One in 23."
8310020,8311020," Where did I get that from?"
8311020,8317100," Three out of 25 of the couch ripper pillow in this size, the biggest size of both and the"
8317100,8322500," team read pillow will have a chance of containing an actual CPU."
8322500,8327940," The value of the CPU will be between $161.18 and $698.99."
8327940,8329780," No purchase necessary."
8329780,8331940," All the details are on the product page."
8331940,8337540," But yes, my friends, you can buy a pillow and get an actual CPU in your order."
8337540,8343260," The odds of receiving one are not some infinitely small chance."
8343260,8350260," It is three in 25 to get an actual CPU in your order, not valid in Quebec."
8350260,8354860," That's the only stipulation because they are like super anal about giveaways and stuff"
8354860,8355860," over there."
8355860,8357020," I don't know what their problem is."
8357020,8361580," They just don't want the Quebec Quad to have anything nice."
8361580,8363540," They do have some pretty nice consumer protections over there."
8363540,8364540," I will give them that."
8364540,8367980," They have a bureau that takes care of stuff that the BC government doesn't seem to care"
8367980,8370500," about at all."
8370500,8372340," What else we got?"
8372340,8375140," We are -- oh, yes, this is important."
8375140,8380300," Luke, I need you to play hat roulette with me."
8380300,8381300," Hat roulette."
8381300,8382300," Okay."
8382300,8384380," So I'm going to go like this."
8384380,8390860," I have two seemingly identical hats, identical plain black hats."
8390860,8391860," Okay."
8391860,8396420," Now, tell me which one you want."
8396420,8398380," The left one."
8398380,8400420," My left or your left?"
8400420,8402260," Thank you for that."
8402260,8403260," Okay."
8403260,8404260," All right."
8404260,8406700," We are each going to put on our hats."
8406700,8407700," All right."
8407700,8418380," Dan, can I invite you up here to be our lovely assistant?"
8418380,8421700," The adjustment mechanism is a little bit -- okay, you figured it out really quickly."
8421700,8422700," Fine, cool."
8422700,8423700," Okay."
8423700,8425940," We are both wearing hats."
8425940,8427460," One is waterproof."
8427460,8428460," One is not."
8428460,8429460," Okay."
8429460,8430460," All right."
8430460,8431460," Okay."
8431460,8432460," Okay."
8432460,8433460," No, not fair."
8433460,8434460," Okay."
8434460,8436760," So, okay."
8436760,8442180," I guess what I'll do is I'll kind of go this way so that the excess just kind of pours"
8442180,8443180," on the floor."
8443180,8446460," So I don't have to be wet for the next two hours everywhere except my head."
8446460,8447460," Okay."
8447460,8448460," Hit me."
8448460,8449460," Oh, my God."
8449460,8450460," Yeah."
8450460,8453140," I mean, you got to clean this up."
8453140,8454980," You're going to have to pour some water."
8454980,8456140," No, no, it'll evaporate."
8456140,8457140," It's fine."
8457140,8458140," Okay."
8458140,8459140," All right."
8459140,8460140," Okay."
8460140,8461140," Okay."
8461140,8463900," So that's going to either soak through or yours will."
8463900,8466540," Wait, did you only pour on the brim?"
8466540,8467820," I got some on the top too."
8467820,8468820," Oh, okay."
8468820,8470420," I might have the waterproof one then."
8470420,8472420," Let's see how Luke does."
8472420,8473420," Oh, yeah."
8473420,8474420," Everywhere."
8474420,8475420," Oh, yeah."
8475420,8477420," That one is very different."
8477420,8478420," Oh."
8478420,8480420," Is this the waterproof one?"
8480420,8482300," It looks like it."
8482300,8485020," Hey, hey, you're rubbing the water in here."
8485020,8486020," Oh, no."
8486020,8487020," No, yeah."
8487020,8488020," That one's not."
8488020,8489020," Oh, why?"
8489020,8490020," Oh, it's not."
8490020,8491020," Oh, yeah, definitely not."
8491020,8492020," Okay."
8492020,8493020," That is incredible."
8493020,8494020," Look at that."
8494020,8495020," Whoa."
8495020,8496820," It's beaded up."
8496820,8497820," Okay."
8497820,8501220," I don't know how well they can see that, but it's beaded up on the brim."
8501220,8502220," Here is what we..."
8502220,8503220," No, I'm good."
8503220,8504220," Thanks, Dan."
8504220,8506700," Here is what we need to talk to you guys about."
8506700,8510740," We are working on a new hat offering."
8510740,8513660," Some of this stuff is going to be the same regardless."
8513660,8515260," So no smarty."
8515260,8518660," So there's absolutely no pressure points on your head."
8518660,8521740," Super comfortable inner band material."
8521740,8526300," This adjustment mechanism can be a little tricky to figure out the first time, but"
8526300,8530060," is designed mostly to ensure that there is no pressure point."
8530060,8532740," If you wear it backwards, forwards, whatever."
8532740,8535220," It's a really comfortable hat."
8535220,8538660," What we're trying to figure out is..."
8538660,8541460," Is it worth it to people for it to be water resistant?"
8541460,8542460," Oh, yeah."
8542460,8545460," So do you mind creating a pole in the float plane chat?"
8545460,8547820," I want to give you guys some idea."
8547820,8548820," It's a really..."
8548820,8550820," It's a high-end hat."
8550820,8557140," It's a really nice hat, but it's either going to be a $20 hat, which from my point of"
8557140,8561500," view is already pretty expensive for something that you can get for free at trade shows."
8561500,8566500," But it'll be an LTT hat."
8566500,8568580," It'll probably be around $20."
8568580,8569580," If we do the LTT hat..."
8569580,8570580," It's not..."
8570580,8572380," You were just talking about how it's a nicer hat, though."
8572380,8574220," It's not something you get to trade shows."
8574220,8580340," No, I just mean there's a certain amount that I'm willing to pay for something like a travel"
8580340,8582060," power adapter."
8582060,8587580," If I can get one for free, then it needs to either be an amazing one or it needs to not"
8587580,8589220," cost that much more."
8589220,8590220," I got you."
8590220,8591220," Yeah."
8591220,8594020," So this one is really great, really comfortable."
8594020,8595940," We're going to do a couple different sizes."
8595940,8599740," The one that's kind of small to medium, one that's kind of large to XL, kind of thing"
8599740,8601380," because Nick Light tried this one."
8601380,8603180," It was like, \"Yeah, it's too small.\""
8603180,8604820," It was just too shallow."
8604820,8605820," It looked hilarious."
8605820,8608180," It looked like he was wearing a Yamaka."
8608180,8610540," I didn't realize how big his head was."
8610540,8611540," Yeah."
8611540,8613220," Well, him bald."
8613220,8614540," His head still looks kind of big."
8614540,8616340," Oh, that makes sense."
8616340,8620140," Anyway, Nick Light."
8620140,8625220," That one, because of the cost of that material, because that's not just a spray on treatment"
8625220,8631260," that goes away, because of the cost of that material, it would be closer to $40."
8631260,8634140," So that would be LTT hat pro."
8634140,8640860," So this is LTT hat, which is already a good hat, and that's LTT hat pro, which is functionally"
8640860,8642740," identical to LTT hat."
8642740,8644460," Is it hydrophobic?"
8644460,8645460," Yes."
8645460,8646460," Okay, yeah."
8646460,8650620," But it is water repelling."
8650620,8653340," Yeah."
8653340,8654940," So which one?"
8654940,8659500," Because there's going to be a Nimmer order quantity involved in the fabric order, no"
8659500,8665620," matter what we do, and we don't necessarily want to bring in like 20,000 hats."
8665620,8668380," So we're kind of hoping to settle on one."
8668380,8672260," If you guys can let us know, what do you want to see?"
8672260,8675340," So I'm asking right now, which one do you think we should launch?"
8675340,8677900," And saying $20 hat or $40 hydrophobic hat."
8677900,8678900," Cool."
8678900,8679900," Yeah."
8679900,8680900," Okay."
8680900,8682660," So we'll have a look at what float plane chat wants to our float plane chat wants."
8682660,8687020," I know there was a poll issue earlier, so we'll see if it goes."
8687020,8688380," It looks like it went."
8688380,8689380," It looks like it went."
8689380,8690380," Okay."
8690380,8691780," I'll check in on the results in a little bit."
8691780,8695540," Personally, can I throw my hat in the ring as it were?"
8695540,8697300," You are going to influence the vote, Luke."
8697300,8698700," You can't just influence it right away."
8698700,8699700," Okay."
8699700,8700700," No."
8700700,8701700," Actually, I forbid it."
8701700,8702700," Okay."
8702700,8703700," All right."
8703700,8705180," No, I can't forbid it."
8705180,8706180," I can't do whatever you want to do."
8706180,8707180," Okay."
8707180,8713540," So anyway, with your argument for you can get this trade show."
8713540,8714540," Just watch."
8714540,8717700," We're going to forget for the third week in a row now because I didn't do it."
8717700,8721940," With your argument of like, there's there's there's ways to, you know, get free hats."
8721940,8726940," In my opinion, the like special hydrophobic one makes more sense if you're going to buy"
8726940,8728660," a hat anyways, personally."
8728660,8729660," Okay."
8729660,8730860," The poll is apparently broken."
8730860,8731900," Oh, wait."
8731900,8732900," Some people were able to vote."
8732900,8733900," People are getting votes in."
8733900,8734900," Okay."
8734900,8735900," Wow."
8735900,8741060," The overwhelming majority, I think we've seen enough four to two or four to one."
8741060,8742940," The hydrophobic hat is winning."
8742940,8745140," Don't bother with the $20 hat says the people."
8745140,8747060," Well, I think we've got our answer then."
8747060,8748060," See you later."
8748060,8749060," LTT hat."
8749060,8750060," Hello."
8750060,8751060," LTT hat."
8751060,8752060," Prader."
8752060,8753060," It looks the same."
8753060,8754060," Yeah."
8754060,8755060," It looks."
8755060,8758900," I was really trying to like, I am up to see like, what is he getting at here?"
8758900,8760900," And I was like, I'm pretty sure that same thing."
8760900,8761900," Yeah."
8761900,8762900," Okay."
8762900,8763900," All right."
8763900,8764900," The hydrophobic hat."
8764900,8765900," Cool."
8765900,8766900," Yeah, it's a super cool material."
8766900,8767900," I really like it."
8767900,8769180," It feels like it feels totally normal too."
8769180,8771180," It feels exactly the same as the other one."
8771180,8772300," I can't tell them apart."
8772300,8773300," Yeah."
8773300,8774300," It's interesting."
8774300,8775300," But it's hydrophobic."
8775300,8776300," Yeah."
8776300,8777300," All right."
8777300,8778300," Finally this."
8778300,8781900," Dan, do you mind manning the Luke cam?"
8781900,8782900," This is cool."
8782900,8784420," Do we have any things that fit?"
8784420,8786180," Oh, I have a thing that fits in that."
8786180,8787700," Why are you trying to figure out what it is?"
8787700,8789660," Well, I go get a thing that goes in it."
8789660,8790660," What the bag is?"
8790660,8791660," Yeah."
8791660,8794340," Honestly, I've been trying to figure this out for a while."
8794340,8796100," It has a water bottle."
8796100,8797580," Water bottle."
8797580,8798580," Water bottle."
8798580,8803420," It has a water bottle holder on the side, which is kind of cool because it's like quick"
8803420,8804420," release."
8804420,8805420," You just pull this straight."
8805420,8806620," I've never seen this before."
8806620,8810540," So I'm showing off or I've never been like briefed on this."
8810540,8812620," So I'm just I'm just sending it."
8812620,8813620," So I'm sorry."
8813620,8817420," Whoever designed this, if I say something that's dumb or wrong, but there's like there's these"
8817420,8820820," little elastic things that hold the bottle in place."
8820820,8822820," There's one on the bottom here."
8822820,8824700," You can see right there."
8824700,8826180," Yeah, whenever you're ready."
8826180,8828340," Little bottle there that has a string on the bottom."
8828340,8832140," So you could just move that out of the way and like drop it out."
8832140,8836020," And then there's also this string that goes over the elastic or whatever that goes over"
8836020,8838580," top so you could move that out of the way and then pull it out."
8838580,8843260," I think that's sweet because I like the idea of water bottles that are stored externally"
8843260,8848020," in bags, even though ours, you know, I've never had mine leak, but like it's nice to"
8848020,8850220," have water bottles stored externally regardless."
8850220,8852100," Okay, but what about what is the bag for?"
8852100,8853100," What is it for?"
8853100,8854100," Yeah."
8854100,8856540," To me, I immediately jumped to like switch or steam deck."
8856540,8857540," Okay."
8857540,8858540," But I don't know."
8858540,8860940," Oh, hey, I think I was on it."
8860940,8861940," Okay."
8861940,8866100," So I actually haven't tested any of these devices in it personally."
8866100,8870780," Why don't we start with the steam deck since that's obviously the most popular gaming PC"
8870780,8871780," handheld."
8871780,8875500," Yeah, there you go."
8875500,8876500," Dan."
8876500,8879580," Yeah, Luke, you're kind of holding it where Dan can't see it."
8879580,8880580," Nice."
8880580,8881580," Nice."
8881580,8884780," You do a great job performing at maximum capacity."
8884780,8885780," Done."
8885780,8886780," Okay."
8886780,8891700," So the idea, I'm going to go back to the wide cam for a second here, Dan."
8891700,8894700," I don't know how well they can hear me when I'm far away from my mic."
8894700,8895700," Speak up a little bit more."
8895700,8896700," Speak up a bit more."
8896700,8898260," This is like a gamer satchel pouch?"
8898260,8899260," Yeah."
8899260,8903340," So it's a gamer kind of day pack."
8903340,8905740," It's kind of, I don't know."
8905740,8911900," It's like, it's somewhere, it's kind of like a messenger bag, but you don't have a laptop."
8911900,8914420," When you need to stay hydrated and also play video games."
8914420,8915420," Yeah."
8915420,8916420," Which is great."
8916420,8921100," It's got a little bit of extra space for some other stuff."
8921100,8924300," You could put some SD cards or a few little things."
8924300,8925300," Battery pack."
8925300,8931180," But it mostly is a carrying case for your game console that is intended to be worn as"
8931180,8935180," kind of like a, I think Matthew called it a cross body bag."
8935180,8938260," So it goes kind of like that."
8938260,8939740," Oh, if you go to Luke Cam."
8939740,8940740," Luke Cam."
8940740,8941740," Oh, I see."
8941740,8944740," Oh, I can step over here."
8944740,8945740," Yeah."
8945740,8946740," Okay."
8946740,8947740," We're making it work, guys."
8947740,8951100," So it's intended to be worn kind of like this."
8951100,8955540," And then the idea is that you kind of bring it around, you can get your, your water bottle,"
8955540,8957340," you can get it, whatever."
8957340,8960340," Then you just kind of put it here."
8960340,8961340," This is really cool."
8961340,8964500," Hold on, let me see if I can."
8964500,8973340," Oh, so it slides apart and then just goes together magnetically, but it's super secure."
8973340,8974340," Okay."
8974340,8978700," So you can put it right in because it's a magnet, but then pulling directly against"
8978700,8982220," it, the magnetic force is so strong that you have to slide it."
8982220,8984220," That's really, that's kind of neat."
8984220,8985220," It's not magnetic."
8985220,8986220," Oh, what?"
8986220,8987220," They're super cool."
8987220,8989220," They're from Fidlock."
8989220,8990220," That's neat."
8990220,8992420," I just got friends."
8992420,8993900," Okay."
8993900,8997900," So back to the wide cam then."
8997900,9004340," Basically what we want to know, actually, I think there were, there were notes."
9004340,9006780," We want community feedback."
9006780,9009660," Would you want something that's just?"
9009660,9011660," What was that?"
9011660,9013980," Was that the same deck?"
9013980,9014980," No."
9014980,9016860," That was a 1X player."
9016860,9020220," It's like a really good one."
9020220,9023900," Uh, it ended on carpet, pretty thick carpet."
9023900,9027260," Yeah, and then it also hit the leg of the table, which is made of metal."
9027260,9028260," Face down."
9028260,9029260," It seems okay."
9029260,9035860," Anyway, what would you be more interested in?"
9035860,9039540," Something that's mostly just the size of a steam deck."
9039540,9044940," Something a little bigger that's more like messenger bag, like laptop bag sized, but has"
9044940,9047940," a spot for a steam deck or..."
9047940,9053140," It's hard to get this right because one that's big enough for a steam deck is comically"
9053140,9057700," large for a Nintendo Switch, which has, you know, got an install base many, many times"
9057700,9059140," larger than the steam deck."
9059140,9063420," So we're already looking at it going, would we have to do two of them?"
9063420,9066780," Like in two different sizes, that's extra product development."
9066780,9069180," It's higher minimum order quantities."
9069180,9072620," Is this something that you guys are interested in at all?"
9072620,9073620," Maybe is there a..."
9073620,9074620," I don't know how are you..."
9074620,9075860," I don't really want to do another poll right now."
9075860,9076860," Yeah."
9076860,9077860," How are we planning to take..."
9077860,9084660," I don't know a poll, but how are we planning to take feedback on this?"
9084660,9085940," I don't know what the plan was."
9085940,9086940," Think about it for a week."
9086940,9088580," Yeah, think about it for a week."
9088580,9089740," We'll do a poll next week."
9089740,9093660," And we'll create a forum thread or we'll chat about it next week."
9093660,9095180," I feel like more info..."
9095180,9098500," I think the forum threads are a good idea because I feel like more feedback other than"
9098500,9100580," just a voting poll is actually a pretty good idea."
9100580,9101580," Oh, not a voting poll."
9101580,9102580," Yeah."
9102580,9106100," I want people to tell us what they want because we've been sitting and kind of going back"
9106100,9107100," and forth."
9107100,9108100," We've been able to improve the water bottle holder."
9108100,9110300," We don't want it to be like this."
9110300,9113020," It's not going to be big enough for the 40 ounce."
9113020,9118940," This is not meant for the 21 ounce and similar."
9118940,9120340," It'll be a little bit adjustable."
9120340,9124020," It's not like we're going to make you locked into our stupid water bottle or whatever."
9124020,9125020," And it's not a stupid bottle."
9125020,9126340," It's a good water bottle."
9126340,9128860," But it's stupid to make you locked into just one."
9128860,9129860," But it's not gonna..."
9129860,9131420," I feel like it can be like fabric cupped to the bottom."
9131420,9135140," Yeah, it's just a weight issue because we like the idea of it being quick and easy to"
9135140,9138300," pop off and not wobbling around too much."
9138300,9142500," But we don't like the idea and the big one's just too heavy."
9142500,9145380," It just doesn't make sense for a bag this size."
9145380,9147180," Do you guys want it to accommodate more?"
9147180,9149140," Do you want it to be even slimmer?"
9149140,9152140," Basically to steam deck, nothing else."
9152140,9153140," Yeah."
9153140,9156580," Are you interested?"
9156580,9158100," That's kind of where we're at."
9158100,9159220," Oh no."
9159220,9162300," The merch messages server has crashed."
9162300,9167260," The last 400 are lost forever but we'll be fine going forward, says Conrad."
9167260,9175820," So before I got up to man that camera, we had over 1200."
9175820,9176820," I see."
9176820,9180540," Oh yeah, they're gone."
9180540,9183540," Okay."
9183540,9187260," Silver lining, there are still lots for us to read."
9187260,9188820," But none of the curation."
9188820,9189820," Yeah."
9189820,9193060," Oh no."
9193060,9198220," Oh, I'm so sorry you guys."
9198220,9199700," Yeah."
9199700,9203180," Oh, I'm sorry guys."
9203180,9209500," Well, yeah, we will still try to find some to."
9209500,9210500," I did."
9210500,9211660," I wrote one down."
9211660,9212660," You wrote one down."
9212660,9213660," Okay."
9213660,9214660," That's all I got."
9214660,9215660," That's good."
9215660,9217260," We have one."
9217260,9218260," Okay."
9218260,9221740," Oh, I'm, I don't even really know what to say."
9221740,9225620," That's just, that's really unfortunate and I apologize."
9225620,9226620," Okay."
9226620,9227620," Shoot."
9227620,9234060," Should we do a topic?"
9234060,9235060," Yes."
9235060,9237140," Oh, I'm sorry guys."
9237140,9242340," What's, is there any, man, any way for us to work around anything?"
9242340,9243900," I doubt it, but I'm looking into it."
9243900,9244900," Okay."
9244900,9245900," All right."
9245900,9246900," Okay."
9246900,9249980," Well, we figure out if we can get anything back."
9249980,9250980," Yeah."
9250980,9252740," Everything's just been on fire this week, you guys."
9252740,9259340," We are, if it helps at all, we are trying."
9259340,9263820," Right, Dan, you're just a pout for that."
9263820,9264820," Okay."
9264820,9265820," I'm done."
9265820,9266820," Yeah."
9266820,9267820," Is this your lunch?"
9267820,9270060," No, this is me going to have to come back."
9270060,9271060," Oh, okay."
9271060,9272060," All right."
9272060,9273060," Dan's going to go talk to Conrad."
9273060,9274060," Yeah, do you go to do?"
9274060,9275060," Okay."
9275060,9276060," I guess Luke's helping me host the show still then."
9276060,9277060," Yeah."
9277060,9278060," Yeah."
9278060,9279060," Isn't it great?"
9279060,9281140," You know, on the one hand, you know, you hire a bunch of people and you've got all"
9281140,9285260," this like overhead and stress and you know, you have need an HR team to manage it or"
9285260,9286260," whatever."
9286260,9290020," But on the other hand, you're all, you're all like, okay, something needs to be, okay,"
9290020,9291020," go do it."
9291020,9294260," And then you can do your thing and then we're both doing our things and like it's all happening"
9294260,9295260," in parallons."
9295260,9296260," Yeah."
9296260,9297260," Wow."
9297260,9298500," The parallization is very interesting to witness."
9298500,9299500," Okay."
9299500,9304020," The Swiss Department of Defense cites the WAN show."
9304020,9305780," I feel like I've talked a lot today."
9305780,9306780," Can you walk me through this?"
9306780,9308460," I haven't looked at this yet at all."
9308460,9310060," I haven't read it other than the headline."
9310060,9311060," Yeah."
9311060,9316460," I would, I, I like not externally, but I definitely internally cheered when I saw this."
9316460,9322740," The cybersecurity research arm of the Swiss Department of Defense has released an assessment"
9322740,9328220," of the cyber defense implications of large language models."
9328220,9334140," The main threats outlined include use in spying, influence operations, vulnerabilities, injection,"
9334140,9340980," control hijacking and phishing attacks, which are all, that's an acute good observation."
9340980,9348180," Information leaks both intentional and accidental in part due to deeper web indexing, extracting"
9348180,9350060," sensitive information."
9350060,9355700," Also, I'll add in here, potentially because, you know, if people in the Swiss government"
9355700,9360900," or in Swiss defense start using these systems to aid them in their jobs and then give them"
9360900,9363420," information that they shouldn't, that would be bad."
9363420,9371540," This type of stuff has 100% happened at a huge variety of companies already."
9371540,9374020," Manipulation and dissemination of misinformation."
9374020,9375020," Absolutely."
9375020,9382780," This is already a huge concern for some people and empowering unsophisticated attackers."
9382780,9386940," That's like the coolest, most highbrow way of seeing script kitties ever."
9386940,9388940," I love unsophisticated attackers."
9388940,9390940," They need a monocle."
9390940,9394180," Yeah."
9394180,9401300," In its description of the abilities and limitations of Bing chat and GPT-4, the assessment, the"
9401300,9403820," alarm and the building is going to set itself."
9403820,9405460," Can you undo that?"
9405460,9408180," Oh, that makes sense."
9408180,9409180," I'm on it."
9409180,9410180," I'm on it."
9410180,9411180," Yeah."
9411180,9416180," In its description of the abilities and limitations of Bing chat and GPT-4, the assessment specifically"
9416180,9422580," cites the February 10 episode of The Wanshow titled \"Our Biggest Sponsor Pulled Out,\""
9422580,9427460," where we all lost our minds about Bing for 52 minutes straight."
9427460,9433100," The official text says, \"Based on some public demos, Linus Tech Tips,\" in brackets 2023,"
9433100,9434100," I don't know."
9434100,9442820," In addition to being able to perform search queries, Bing GPT seems to be capable of,"
9442820,9446620," and this is why I was like, \"Okay, this is actually legit.\""
9446620,9451540," Perform image-to-text conversion, image object type, color, logo, nature."
9451540,9454820," Perform basic logic reasoning to split queries."
9454820,9460700," So bags of X type that will fit in trunk of Y car, and then size of bags of X type to"
9460700,9463740," size of car-wise trunk."
9463740,9465420," Perform basic knowledge reasoning."
9465420,9468780," Basically, everything we talked about, I'm not going to go through all of it, but everything"
9468780,9472780," we talked about in that show, including like when we had it look up,"
9472780,9478740," bone mass, and then it figured out that it was actually biomass, and like how it reasoned"
9478740,9479740," and stuff like that."
9479740,9480740," They go through all of it."
9480740,9481740," Very interesting."
9481740,9482980," There's some discussion questions."
9482980,9487540," Is it strange thinking about how far the internet has come in the past 10 to 20 years"
9487540,9493820," that an official government assessment can cite a YouTube video, especially one that"
9493820,9496940," to make it a little bit more at home, that you're in?"
9496940,9505020," Yeah, I mean, it shouldn't surprise me, and yet it always does."
9505020,9511460," I think a perfect example of this is the video that we uploaded challenging YouTube to do"
9511460,9514660," better on HDR."
9514660,9520500," I obviously like it, if someone asked me, I could reason my way through it."
9520500,9525620," Yeah, a lot of people who work through YouTube are probably technophiles."
9525620,9534100," We have 14 million subscribers at the time, which in the English speaking world is a"
9534100,9542020," huge percentage of the people at all, like not insignificant, and of the tech interested"
9542020,9547220," people in the English speaking world is like, I already know that I can't walk around on"
9547220,9550580," a CES show floor without being constantly stopped."
9550580,9558900," And yet I will hear things like, yeah, this video is everywhere, top to bottom, and fires"
9558900,9561300," are being lit, right?"
9561300,9565260," It always surprises me when I hear it, even though cognitively I understand that--"
9565260,9566820," The same thing would happen here."
9566820,9567820," Yeah."
9567820,9568820," Yeah."
9568820,9569820," Exactly."
9569820,9572300," But it's weird to think that it would also happen elsewhere."
9572300,9575540," We think of Google as nameless and faceless."
9575540,9580980," But it is full of people with names and with faces that are looking at us right now."
9580980,9581980," Yeah."
9581980,9582980," But actually, yeah."
9582980,9584980," Yeah, it's weird but interesting."
9584980,9591220," You always do-- like, it's not like celebrities or people in power or people at large companies"
9591220,9595220," or whatever it is, or people in positions of influence at large companies, et cetera,"
9595220,9596220," et cetera, et cetera."
9596220,9599460," It's not like outside of their job they just cease to exist."
9599460,9604540," Like, they use products that maybe you worked on if you're in design or manufacturing or"
9604540,9605540," whatever."
9605540,9606980," They watch things."
9606980,9608820," They play games."
9608820,9614460," You might have played Fortnite at some point with the lead designer for Fortnite."
9614460,9615460," Yeah, you might."
9615460,9620100," You might not have known that it was him or her or whoever, but the screen name is going"
9620100,9622220," to be whatever it is."
9622220,9623220," And you might have played with them."
9623220,9624220," Who knows?"
9624220,9625740," You never know who you're interacting with."
9625740,9626740," You never know who's watching."
9626740,9627740," You don't-- yeah."
9627740,9628740," Interesting."
9628740,9631460," Want to hear something wild?"
9631460,9636460," You already have almost 100 new merge messages."
9636460,9640700," Do we have any news, by the way?"
9640700,9641700," On the spot."
9641700,9643980," Probably not positive news."
9643980,9652100," So it looks like the logs most likely didn't save the curated status, but we're currently"
9652100,9656420," working through pulling the entire order history from this evening."
9656420,9659740," So not good news for you."
9659740,9662900," But let me make a sandwich for you."
9662900,9664140," Jesus."
9664140,9673660," But the good news, bastard, is we can pull the entire order history and then I will go"
9673660,9677100," through and curate the 1500 messages."
9677100,9678100," OK."
9678100,9679100," OK."
9679100,9680100," It's fast."
9680100,9681100," It's all over again."
9681100,9686460," I actually love how the power dynamic has changed on this show from you punching up to"
9686460,9689420," him punching up and up."
9689420,9691300," He's my boss now."
9691300,9693820," It's my terror."
9693820,9695660," You get to have it from both sides."
9695660,9696660," Yeah, it's great."
9696660,9697660," Oh, I'm down."
9697660,9698660," Let's go."
9698660,9700660," He's always down for getting it from-- sorry."
9700660,9701660," I'm a whole circle."
9701660,9704060," Who did we interview earlier?"
9704060,9705060," Sorry."
9705060,9707260," I can't do this anymore."
9707260,9709780," It took him a second, but he came up there."
9709780,9710780," We're all tired."
9710780,9711780," Hold on."
9711780,9712780," I got it."
9712780,9715260," That is really rough news for Dan."
9715260,9718060," But I mean, I felt horrible."
9718060,9719060," Yeah."
9719060,9720300," I lost those."
9720300,9721940," So sure, it's going to be really rough."
9721940,9722900," I'll try to jump in."
9722900,9726420," If we can somehow get those dashboards or the ones that are incoming now, I'll try"
9726420,9727420," to help whatever--"
9727420,9732020," If we can at least find some, you know, to kind of skim through and acknowledge or whatever."
9732020,9733020," It was just--"
9733020,9734820," It was a very bad feeling that we lost those."
9734820,9736380," Scattershot is better than no shot."
9736380,9737380," Yes."
9737380,9738620," Well, it's the feeling of losing data."
9738620,9739620," Yeah."
9739620,9741620," Nobody likes the feeling of losing data."
9741620,9742620," Yes."
9742620,9745020," So even if it was worthless data, when I press delete--"
9745020,9746020," Man."
9746020,9747700," Oh, like anything?"
9747700,9753820," I feel like a shadow of every time I've ever lost something real."
9753820,9755820," I get this anxiety and this stress."
9755820,9760220," And immediately after I have this feeling, like, what if it was something important?"
9760220,9762820," When I permanently delete data, you know?"
9762820,9763820," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
9763820,9764820," Ooh."
9764820,9765820," I just--"
9765820,9768300," I don't like it feels completely unimportant now."
9768300,9770660," What if I'll need it later?"
9770660,9771660," Yeah."
9771660,9772660," Yeah."
9772660,9775500," I'm not so much of a hoarder in regards to stuff."
9775500,9776500," Oh, but I did."
9776500,9777500," A little bit."
9777500,9779860," Some sentimental things, but I was out of that not so much."
9779860,9780700," But data, yeah."
9780700,9785260," It costs so little to keep that it feels stupid to let it go."
9785260,9786260," Yeah."
9786260,9787260," You know?"
9787260,9788260," OK."
9788260,9792820," Well, if you want to take a talking break, maybe I can try to do another topic."
9792820,9795820," If you want to do some incoming messages, and then we can trade off a little bit to try"
9795820,9797260," to save dance and time."
9797260,9798260," I'm going to--"
9798260,9799260," Do you have that data set yet?"
9799260,9800260," Are you chewing through it already?"
9800260,9801260," We're working on that."
9801260,9802340," It's a special thing."
9802340,9804180," Is that something that we have any access to?"
9804180,9805180," I don't believe so."
9805180,9806180," I doubt it."
9806180,9807180," I seriously doubt it."
9807180,9811860," So then game publishers refusing to sell older games."
9811860,9815300," And meanwhile, Valve releases a massive counter strike update."
9815300,9816300," Sort of."
9816300,9817300," The update, yeah, I guess."
9817300,9818300," Sort of."
9818300,9819300," OK."
9819300,9823380," So Nintendo is shutting down the e-shops on the Wii U and the 3DS next week."
9823380,9826820," By the way, did you see the video from the completionist buying everything from them?"
9826820,9827820," That's in here, yeah."
9827820,9828820," Oh, is it?"
9828820,9830020," Oh, no, this is great."
9830020,9831020," OK."
9831020,9834220," As well as sun setting, it's virtual console service."
9834220,9840180," Now, the only legal way to acquire retro Nintendo games will be through the Switch Online Expansion"
9840180,9845180," Pack, which is, you guessed it, a subscription service."
9845180,9847020," 50 bucks a year."
9847020,9851580," You will own nothing and you will like it."
9851580,9856220," Gerard, the completionist then, spent over $22,000."
9856220,9863580," I don't know that I would actually encourage giving Nintendo money in response to their"
9863580,9865660," anti-consumer practices, but OK."
9865660,9868460," I do have a very weird theory on this, by the way."
9868460,9869980," Sorry, I'll finish this off."
9869980,9871300," I know you've talked a lot."
9871300,9878220," $22,000 buying nearly 866 Wii U games and 1357 3DS games."
9878220,9880660," Nearly 1.5 terabytes worth."
9880660,9884220," That was, by the way, the most polite way anyone's ever told me to shut up."
9884220,9889460," Dude, a limitation's of the e-shop where only one game can be purchased at a time."
9889460,9893620," This project took 328 days to complete."
9893620,9897420," Gerard and his team will be donating the games to the video game history."
9897420,9898420," OK, cool."
9898420,9900380," Video Game History Foundation for Preservation."
9900380,9905740," What I was going to say is, I guess not now, but I bet you those systems would be worth"
9905740,9910500," a lot later on to collect your people."
9910500,9916660," But donating it to Video Game History Foundation is like way cooler of a move."
9916660,9918820," So I respect that a ton."
9918820,9923980," I didn't even think about that as like a path, probably because I'm extremely tired."
9923980,9926460," But that's super, super cool."
9926460,9928260," Big respect for that."
9928260,9930700," And just a very interesting project in general."
9930700,9934180," Ryu Kress says Microsoft driven FUD."
9934180,9937020," They do the same thing in the press, help them not get hate."
9937020,9938300," Game Pass, hello?"
9938300,9939300," It's not the same thing."
9939300,9940940," You can buy those games."
9940940,9944540," However, let's move into our next topic."
9944540,9950700," Meanwhile, EA is delisting, Battlefield 1943, and both bad companies from Digital Storefronts"
9950700,9954980," in advance of their online services shutting down in December."
9954980,9958180," Current owners will still be able to play the single player campaigns following the server"
9958180,9961780," closure, but this is something Luke and I have been talking about for years at this"
9961780,9962780," point."
9962780,9969740," The multiplayer experiences of these games, which by the way is the game, are gone."
9969740,9972860," And I'm actually pretty sure people still play those."
9972860,9974580," Well, yeah, I wouldn't they?"
9974580,9975580," The Battlefield games."
9975580,9981140," And like Battlefield kind of got a lot worse over time."
9981140,9984500," So like bad company had a lot of destruction elements and stuff that was actually like"
9984500,9985940," really cool."
9985940,9988020," So I know people were still really into bad company."
9988020,9989020," This sucks."
9989020,9995860," I mean, if there was a single gamer in government, like you got to feel like they would kind"
9995860,9998300," of go, hey, this is a big problem."
9998300,10004220," We need to actually make it illegal to sell this thing to someone based on a box, right?"
10004220,10006740," Like these are old enough games that they had boxes."
10006740,10007740," All right."
10007740,10012340," So there's this thing on the box that says multiplayer up to whatever players you can't"
10012340,10016340," why are we allowed to sell someone this this even a license to this thing?"
10016340,10017980," I know they're not selling them the software."
10017980,10019340," They're selling them a license to it."
10019340,10027060," But that license has an agreed upon experience."
10027060,10029460," And then it just goes away later."
10029460,10030660," That was not the deal."
10030660,10035780," Yeah, I think having some type of minimum agreement for how long it has to be accessible"
10035780,10037420," to bear minimum."
10037420,10039340," I don't think it necessarily has to be forever."
10039340,10041180," I think that's a lot to ask from companies."
10041180,10046460," No, but what it has to be is there has to be a sunset procedure."
10046460,10047460," Yes."
10047460,10048460," So that's okay."
10048460,10054100," Once that time period ends, you should have if you don't want to maintain it, it should"
10054100,10056900," now be maintainable by someone else."
10056900,10058260," And you can set terms."
10058260,10062460," And we've talked about this before where like you have to purchase a copy of the game"
10062460,10064620," to be able to play it on the newly maintained system."
10064620,10067300," The newly maintained system cannot be monetized."
10067300,10068300," Things like that."
10068300,10073220," I don't don't care, but it should be possible for historical reasons for people to be able"
10073220,10074220," to set it up."
10074220,10077660," What has happened with subcom Supreme Commander so cool."
10077660,10082660," You've commented on this a bunch of times on the show is like perfect in my opinion."
10082660,10088780," The community have set up a genuinely amazing community server community, actually just"
10088780,10091220," genuinely community around it."
10091220,10094900," There's like events that they have, there's custom maps, there's mods, there's like everything"
10094900,10095900," you can imagine."
10095900,10096980," They have a custom launcher."
10096980,10099620," It requires you to have purchased a real right."
10099620,10101500," The rights holders still get paid."
10101500,10102500," Yeah."
10102500,10104340," Like it's it's it's win win win."
10104340,10107860," They're really great for everyone."
10107860,10113460," And then that game gets to survive because sure, you know what, it might be 10 years"
10113460,10115340," down the road down the road."
10115340,10117380," There might not be that many players anymore."
10117380,10120900," It might be far from profitable for you to maintain this thing."
10120900,10123500," And it's like, you know what, it's really time to sunset this."
10123500,10125500," It takes a lot of our dev time, whatever we live."
10125500,10126500," Yeah, fine."
10126500,10127500," Sure."
10127500,10128780," But you have to hand it off."
10128780,10133380," A small distraction in float plane chat says we need more government line of Sebastian."
10133380,10136900," No, what we need is the government to actually do its job."
10136900,10146660," Its job is supposed to be acting as a a protector for its citizens in a sense, right?"
10146660,10152380," Like if if someone breaks into your house and steals your stuff, the government is supposed"
10152380,10154820," to do something about it, right?"
10154820,10158540," You're not supposed to just round up a posse and just what like go wandering the streets"
10158540,10162380," looking for the guy."
10162380,10167380," What we need is for someone to step in and say, no, you may not actually sell something"
10167380,10174020," based on some representation of it and then change it after the fact."
10174020,10178380," I would like to think that people could deal with this themselves by not supporting companies"
10178380,10181580," who are going to behave in this way, but clearly that ship has sailed."
10181580,10182580," Yeah."
10182580,10185980," People are going to keep buying games from EA."
10185980,10187780," Yeah."
10187780,10196500," So, regulation is a good thing because otherwise it's anarchy."
10196500,10204780," There's like things you can use when manufacturing products that will like actually end us all."
10204780,10206180," Yeah."
10206180,10210300," And we need someone to prevent people from doing it because otherwise they've shown time and"
10210300,10211540," time again that they will."
10211540,10212540," Yeah."
10212540,10215620," The giant holes that were forming in the ozone and stuff, which like government came in and"
10215620,10221900," fixed it, are either of us the biggest fans of like over regulation?"
10221900,10222900," No."
10222900,10223900," No."
10223900,10226900," Are either of us the biggest fans of like over governance, all these other types of things?"
10226900,10227900," No."
10227900,10229580," But certain regulations should be in place."
10229580,10231540," A bunch of people are attacking me and be like, stop him."
10231540,10232540," This is hot take territory."
10232540,10233540," I'm like, I agree."
10233540,10234780," What do you want me to do?"
10234780,10236780," No, it's not."
10236780,10239380," It is a good thing that is bestest isn't everywhere."
10239380,10240900," Yeah, that's great."
10240900,10244620," And that sure as heck wasn't private companies dealing with it."
10244620,10246180," No."
10246180,10250660," And you might say, hey, no, they totally did because it was a liability concern."
10250660,10256780," Well, guess who creates the framework of laws that give companies liability?"
10256780,10261060," Like we actually do need some of it need it a little bit."
10261060,10266900," Otherwise, it's just it's it's it's open season for the people with money and power at the"
10266900,10268020," top."
10268020,10273620," And yes, I'm quite wealthy before you have to say it."
10273620,10275020," But I'm not at the top."
10275020,10280100," I am a lot closer to you, the viewer than I am to a billionaire."
10280100,10281100," A lot closer."
10281100,10283380," Yeah, there's actually like a huge difference."
10283380,10290220," Like the kind of the kind of influence that people can wield is unfathomable to me, even"
10290220,10294380," with my small army of team members here, right?"
10294380,10301380," Like it's I'm not I don't get too far into, you know, conspiracy theories or whatever."
10301380,10306060," But there's real stuff that is not conspiracy theory that has actually happened that just"
10306060,10307220," blows my mind."
10307220,10312500," I go, OK, so I'm sorry, like this this person or this cabal of people got together and did"
10312500,10313500," what?"
10313500,10314500," Yeah."
10314500,10315500," Yeah."
10315500,10318300," Okay, I have updates."
10318300,10319300," Yeah."
10319300,10321180," Yeah, hit me."
10321180,10327220," I now have a spreadsheet of unsorted merge messages, including a lot of garbage data that"
10327220,10329300," is two thousand and seven lines along."
10329300,10330860," Yeah, because it's just like the order."
10330860,10334740," I'm going to go parse this and I will have some merge message for you."
10334740,10340420," I believe Conrad is now working through the hundred and seventy that have come in since"
10340420,10342460," this has happened."
10342460,10347060," You should try to see if there's some unique identifier so you can get some of that garbage"
10347060,10348620," data out of there."
10348620,10354100," I am happy to try to shift to old school stuff and start managing incomeings or read."
10354100,10355100," I don't care which one."
10355100,10357460," Yeah, why don't we have three curated ones."
10357460,10358460," Oh, good."
10358460,10360820," Do you want me to read you one before I disappear?"
10360820,10361820," I don't think so."
10361820,10362820," Yeah, you better go."
10362820,10364500," Can we borrow that hat?"
10364500,10366420," Luke's going to do a little bit of curation."
10366420,10372860," Well I talk about that Raja Kaduri is leaving Intel to form a new company focused on developing"
10372860,10377260," generative AI tools for digital movie and game designers."
10377260,10382340," Currently similar tools are developed primarily within video chips in mind, but Kaduri wants"
10382340,10385980," to create tools that are compatible with any processor."
10385980,10391140," Intel has not yet appointed another permanent head for their arc division to replace Kaduri."
10391140,10395700," The discussion question here is what does this mean for Intel and specifically the arc"
10395700,10399020," division and competition among low-end graphics cards."
10399020,10406060," I would like to think that kind of like the Radeon Technologies Group at AMD, this is not"
10406060,10410460," the end at all for Intel's arc graphics division."
10410460,10420580," It's very obvious that Raja has his fingerprints all over arc and that a lot of the groundwork"
10420580,10426860," has already been laid, not just for arc alchemists but also for battle mage and celestial."
10426860,10431540," What I'm hoping is that the team that he and the other members of the team, the other"
10431540,10435980," members of management they're built are going to take that foundation and run with it."
10435980,10442340," I actually have a lot of hope based on the development we've seen already with arc alchemists"
10442340,10447380," that Intel is going to be a legitimate player in the next year or two or three."
10447380,10453380," But yeah, I wish him all the best on his new endeavor and good luck, Godspeed."
10453380,10457260," And with that out of the way, that was really the last major topic."
10457260,10462060," So why don't we start doing some merch messages?"
10462060,10464060," Don't we read you?"
10464060,10465060," Sure."
10465060,10466900," Or do you want to just read yourself out of curated?"
10466900,10468700," I don't know."
10468700,10470660," I'm not sure what's faster."
10470660,10472700," There's so many."
10472700,10474940," Oh, man."
10474940,10475940," My laptop."
10475940,10477980," Oh, wow."
10477980,10481980," The page is heavy."
10481980,10486780," This has never been a problem before."
10486780,10491300," Like I can barely interact with this page without it being leggy."
10491300,10496780," I never thought I would say this, but you guys might be buying too much stuff from LTTstore.com."
10496780,10499940," I mean, don't stop or anything."
10499940,10506580," We lost a day of AdSense that I'm not going to say it's a bad thing and we launched a lot"
10506580,10507580," of really cool products."
10507580,10509540," The whole point, so I just helped a lot with that."
10509540,10510540," Thank you very much."
10510540,10513420," Yeah, but like what the heck?"
10513420,10515540," It's taking me forever to even scroll through the incoming."
10515540,10517380," Okay, I guess I'll do curated."
10517380,10523780," William T says, \"Some of the private videos that were listed as part of the channel recovery,"
10523780,10526980," there was a period of maybe like three or four hours.\""
10526980,10528820," I don't know exactly how long it was."
10528820,10533700," Where every video that was previously private on the channel was public for a bit."
10533700,10536260," And William says, \"Some of them were pretty cool."
10536260,10540060," As an American, I appreciated the Las Vegas range footage."
10540060,10546940," I used to use the LTT channel as just, well, my personal channel because it was."
10546940,10550180," I didn't have a whole team of people that helped do managers or anything like that."
10550180,10553540," So I would just upload random videos to it."
10553540,10556380," That one in particular, I think, was a trip with OCZ."
10556380,10558700," No, this is predates here."
10558700,10559700," I'm pretty sure."
10559700,10561100," I don't know exactly which one it was."
10561100,10562260," I know we've gone."
10562260,10564300," Yeah, I don't think we had a video of it."
10564300,10565940," Remember when it was four."
10565940,10566940," Oh, wait."
10566940,10571220," Yeah, if it was the Las Vegas range, it was probably my trip there with OCZ."
10571220,10575220," And it was just to, I think it was probably unlisted before and I just had uploaded it"
10575220,10578420," to share it with them so that they could check it out."
10578420,10579980," But the channel was chock full."
10579980,10585140," There was FS700 footage with my infant son, just like, you know, playing like airplane"
10585140,10589220," game with them because I had just bought the camera and preparation for launching the channel"
10589220,10596900," and was playing with it at home, not knowing how to use it because Ed hadn't shown me yet."
10596900,10599900," It was kind of fun for me going back and looking through some of it."
10599900,10607180," There was some stuff that I had not uploaded for privacy reasons, but the main one that"
10607180,10614500," was actually problematic was a detailed room by room tour of my house."
10614500,10618820," Like you could build a Counter Strike map with it, you know, like that detailed."
10618820,10619820," Because you're old."
10619820,10620820," But it's my old house."
10620820,10621820," Okay, there you go."
10621820,10622820," Whatever."
10622820,10625020," Yeah, so nothing too catastrophic."
10625020,10629900," A lot of non brand approved versions of videos."
10629900,10634540," There was this really funny thing that we had in our Dyson Vacuum, you know, the really"
10634540,10640620," controversial one, our Dyson Vacuum video where we had, we took like a picture of James"
10640620,10644940," Dyson and we had him like doing the South Park Canadian talking thing where his head's"
10644940,10647740," just split into like Saddam Hussein."
10647740,10649740," And we had him say, \"Blow down up.\""
10649740,10653580," And it was talking about how he canceled"
10653580,10656420," all of their development for corded vacuums,"
10656420,10659860," and they didn't like him going like that."
10659860,10661100," So we had to do a different version,"
10661100,10662780," but that was live for a little bit."
10662780,10665380," Some people thought it was pretty funny."
10665380,10669340," So yeah, a lot of non-brand approved things went up."
10669340,10673100," All right, anyway, it seems to be gone now."
10673100,10675400," Let's go ahead and archive that"
10675400,10676780," and I'll move on to the next one."
10676780,10680980," Samuel, how many messages before we break the message queue?"
10680980,10683460," If we break the queue, will you give us more details"
10683460,10686380," on the magnet wire management?"
10686380,10687980," The only details I can really share"
10687980,10690540," are that we are working with an overseas mold supplier"
10690540,10692820," on this one because doing the molds"
10692820,10696500," with the same supplier that we worked with here in Delta"
10696500,10700060," as a for the screwdriver would have been a few things."
10700060,10702320," It would have been unnecessarily expensive."
10702320,10703660," It would have taken a long time"
10703660,10705440," 'cause they're extremely backlogged"
10705440,10710440," and it would have been needlessly good."
10710440,10714460," The molds for these do need to be precise in certain ways."
10714460,10717420," So the bottom, the way that the magnet retention is handled"
10717420,10721460," is really cool and does need to be pretty precise,"
10721460,10724380," but the rest of it, it's a plastic arch."
10724380,10726140," It holds down cables."
10726140,10728220," It's not something that you have in your hand."
10728220,10731140," For some people hours of the day, right?"
10731140,10733540," Like it doesn't have to be perfect."
10733540,10735180," It just needs to be pretty darn good."
10735180,10737840," And we are happy with the current molds that we have."
10737840,10739320," So we are moving into production"
10739320,10740720," and we're hoping to launch them,"
10740720,10742640," I think sometime this year."
10742640,10744280," But if it doesn't happen, well, hey,"
10744280,10746080," would anyone really be surprised?"
10746080,10748120," We're gonna have, I think it's four different sizes"
10748120,10750480," of just arches, like the ones that I'm holding."
10750480,10752080," I think, I'm assuming that's why you asked about it"
10752080,10754320," because I was fidgeting with them earlier."
10754320,10755720," And then we're gonna have one that's designed"
10755720,10757920," to hold a cable tie so it could hold any size"
10757920,10761360," of cable bundle as long as you don't over power the magnets."
10761360,10762440," Pretty excited about it."
10762440,10764200," And we're gonna have a whole series of content"
10764200,10767020," where we cable manage the worst setups"
10767020,10770920," using our cable ties and hopefully our cables at some point."
10770920,10773460," We have a really promising new cable supplier that I'm--"
10773460,10774780," - Oh. - Yeah."
10774780,10776860," The team is really excited about."
10776860,10777980," - That's cool."
10777980,10780000," - We've made some tough decisions."
10780000,10784960," We are not going to be supporting USB 20 gigabit, I believe."
10784960,10788400," And the reason for that is that basically"
10788400,10793400," no manufactured cable today properly meets the full spec."
10794240,10798400," It'll function, but in terms of the recommendations"
10798400,10801920," from USB-IF or whatever the USB form,"
10801920,10804120," whatever the USB group is,"
10804120,10806520," the actual recommended size of the I"
10806520,10808240," for proper signal integrity,"
10808240,10812080," as far as we can tell no cable properly meets"
10812080,10815880," the recommendations and our standard is going to be that"
10815880,10818880," if we can't do it right, we're simply not going to make it."
10820880,10824280," That may change because Kyle pushed back pretty hard"
10824280,10828960," saying we can make it work very consistently."
10828960,10831880," It's just not, it doesn't have the recommended I size."
10831880,10836880," So that is the amount of space between like the rising"
10836880,10840480," and falling signal or whatever, the zero and the one,"
10840480,10841320," essentially."
10841320,10844240," You want that to be a big enough gap that a zero"
10844240,10845960," can never be confused for a one."
10845960,10848840," So Kyle is pushing back saying like,"
10848840,10850680," it's a big I, it's fine."
10850680,10853280," But that's not really my vibe."
10853280,10855320," So we'll have to kind of, well, we'll fight it out."
10855320,10856160," We'll fight it out."
10856160,10861160," But we just want our cables to be completely trusted."
10861160,10865320," Zero question, it'll do what it says it's going to do."
10865320,10867440," And we're just going to rate them by gigabits per second"
10867440,10872120," in watts rather than gen whatever, whatever nonsense."
10872120,10877440," - What would be kind of cool is if you do the rating that way,"
10877440,10879960," you could also have like an info tab that is like,"
10879960,10881960," just as things that should be capable of then."
10881960,10882800," - Yes."
10882800,10883640," - That makes sense."
10883640,10884640," That'd be sweet."
10884640,10887800," - Chet asks, will the hydrophobicness ever wear off the hats?"
10887800,10888640," I don't know."
10888640,10892280," Stay tuned for the more information that presumably"
10892280,10894600," I will be bringing to you later."
10894600,10895800," It's not a treatment to the fabric."
10895800,10897200," It's a special fabric though."
10897200,10901440," Okay, I thought I replied to that one."
10901440,10903760," I wonder if this is like kind of broken too."
10903760,10905360," Matthew says, hey Linus and Luke."
10905360,10909240," I guess you're, are you available to?"
10909240,10910160," - Yeah, yeah."
10910160,10911160," - I love the content."
10911160,10913280," Have been watching since around 2012."
10913280,10917360," I've been tinkering with making an RC Hot Wheels car."
10917360,10921960," Okay, that would be sick."
10921960,10924920," Is there any chance we'll see more RC content?"
10924920,10928240," Man, RC is tough."
10928240,10931800," I feel like the closest RC has gotten to overlapping"
10931800,10934640," with our content is drones."
10934640,10936560," And there's such cools heck in the space,"
10936560,10940240," whether it's first person view goggles or just like"
10940240,10943800," men to cameras that they're packing on to drones these days."
10943800,10947400," Like how lightweight drones have gotten to deal with"
10947400,10949960," the regulations around people flying them."
10949960,10953760," But it just doesn't perform well on the main channel."
10953760,10958760," And right now, drones are a like a distant,"
10958760,10963200," a distant twinkle in not even my eye."
10963200,10966680," You know, someone else's eye here in terms of a vertical"
10966680,10969120," that we would create a channel that focuses on"
10969120,10969960," or something like that."
10969960,10972160," Like there's just so many more low hanging fruits"
10972160,10973760," that are more in our wheelhouse."
10973760,10977120," So I would see RC as even farther away than that."
10977120,10979160," But I love it."
10979160,10980720," I think it's super cool."
10980720,10982920," I just don't see how we could build a business case"
10982920,10986080," around making more content for RC."
10986080,10989560," I have toyed around with the idea of sticking"
10989560,10994320," the Creator Warehouse team on just like a tiny little RC car"
10994320,10996800," or boat or mouse just because those are things"
10996800,10999440," that are available like to play with cats or like for kids"
10999440,11001120," to play with in the bathtub or whatever."
11001120,11003080," But they all suck."
11003080,11004960," I would want like a good one."
11004960,11007360," Like a little RC mouse toy for cats."
11007360,11010520," It's like a hundred dollars because it's packed full of"
11010520,11014720," like the best motors and you know,"
11014720,11018000," the best radio equipment and it's super durable."
11018000,11020680," It has like an interchangeable top so that when the cat"
11020680,11024120," wears it out or whatever, you can just put on a new one."
11024120,11026760," Like that kind of thing would be awesome."
11026760,11028360," - Sorry, I'm gonna just--"
11028360,11030040," - Good servos show this one."
11030040,11033920," But Trevor W. said print idea for the next batch of underwear."
11033920,11036560," Nude colored with a strawberry on the front"
11036560,11039280," and a crack on the backside."
11039280,11046360," - It would actually be so funny."
11046360,11047840," I think by the time they could get them out,"
11047840,11049440," the meme might be a little dead."
11049440,11050280," - Yeah."
11050280,11051520," - So I don't know if we should like actually do it"
11051520,11052520," but it's funny."
11052520,11055480," - It might be worth doing a printable underwear though."
11055480,11057320," Like underwear blanks."
11057320,11059240," And Steph even occurred to me."
11059240,11062440," And then we could do meme underwear designs and stuff."
11062440,11063280," - Yeah."
11063280,11064120," - Hmm, interesting."
11064120,11066240," Why did I, I have a spout lid."
11066240,11067440," Why did I take the whole thing off?"
11067440,11069280," I'm just, I'm not functioning Luke."
11069280,11070360," I'm not functioning."
11070360,11072560," - I'm with you."
11072560,11075160," - Strawberry underwear."
11075160,11077240," Ah, okay, anywho."
11077240,11078720," Andrew C."
11078720,11080200," I'm watching about an hour behind"
11080200,11081560," so you could have already addressed this."
11081560,11085040," Are there any local concerns after the hacking"
11085040,11087800," on a hardware level like with Goat?"
11087800,11088640," - Yes."
11088640,11090480," So I created this almost for myself."
11090480,11091320," - Yes."
11091320,11093720," - I immediately seized the computer,"
11093720,11095960," disconnected from network, all that kind of stuff."
11095960,11098520," I have it stashed away."
11098520,11103000," Any storage, the motherboard, all that stuff is"
11103000,11104480," gonna be disappeared."
11105320,11106320," (laughs)"
11106320,11110080," But like the CPU, the RAM, the RAM's probably fine."
11110080,11110920," All I could do it a little bit more,"
11110920,11112000," but RAM's probably fine."
11112000,11115200," The CPU, the RAM, the graphics card,"
11115200,11116000," which I'm pretty sure it has."
11116000,11116840," I haven't looked inside it."
11116840,11118760," Like there's the case power supply."
11118760,11120600," Lots of things in there will be recoverable,"
11120600,11122960," but anything that could be compromised"
11122960,11124320," is just going to be destroyed."
11124320,11127200," Is what it is?"
11127200,11128040," - Yeah."
11128040,11129320," - Destroyed."
11129320,11131320," Yeah, what are you destroying?"
11131320,11132720," - A motherboard."
11132720,11134320," - What I'm assuming is an SSD."
11134320,11136720," And then that's probably it."
11136720,11139440," They're compromised."
11139440,11140880," - You have to destroy the motherboard?"
11140880,11141720," That's like--"
11141720,11142560," - Bioscope infected."
11142560,11143920," - Expensive motherboard."
11143920,11145040," - Bioscope infected."
11145040,11148600," I haven't looked enough into what you can do about that."
11148600,11150320," I'm not 100% sure."
11150320,11152040," Just, I haven't looked into it at all."
11152040,11152880," - Damn."
11152880,11153720," - And not 100% sure."
11153720,11154560," - Damn."
11154560,11155400," - No, no, no, let them keep working."
11155400,11156240," Let them keep working."
11156240,11157680," - Can you solder a new BIOS chip?"
11157680,11159640," - Yeah, if you can do that, if you can flash it"
11159640,11162600," and it like genuinely 100% resolves it, whatever,"
11162600,11163600," then we can keep it."
11163600,11165040," Like I still have the whole thing."
11165040,11166200," I haven't done any of this."
11166200,11167040," - Okay."
11167040,11167880," - But at some point in time,"
11167880,11171440," we're going to have to deal with those things."
11171440,11173720," We're definitely not retaining the SSD."
11173720,11174960," That's gone."
11174960,11177280," The motherboard is maybe a keep,"
11177280,11180560," but the SSD is definitely gone."
11180560,11181960," - I hate destroying hardware."
11181960,11182800," - I agree."
11182800,11183920," - It always, it hurts me."
11183920,11184740," - Oh yeah."
11184740,11187800," But like, yeah."
11187800,11189720," There are concerns about the hardware."
11191160,11193000," I just haven't even like,"
11193000,11194840," the only thing I did was I unplugged the computer"
11194840,11196600," and I took it with me so that other people"
11196600,11197840," wouldn't plug it back in."
11197840,11199080," And it's just like a,"
11199080,11201440," now that it's offline, it's not high priority."
11201440,11202360," So I'll deal with it later."
11202360,11205760," But I am aware that the computer is a concern."
11205760,11208520," - Okay."
11208520,11210800," I started doing merge messages."
11210800,11216560," - Oh man, we are,"
11217840,11221440," I feel like how our customer support team must have felt"
11221440,11223800," when we were so far behind as a screwdriver"
11223800,11224640," and backpack launches."
11224640,11226640," - Conrad's even helping us in the dashboard."
11226640,11227560," He's in the dashboard as well."
11227560,11228800," We're playing the messages and stuff."
11228800,11230520," And I think, I don't know this"
11230520,11233200," 'cause I've just barely been communicating with the team."
11233200,11236120," I think, I think because if we keep the load down"
11236120,11237720," a little bit, maybe it survives."
11237720,11239960," (laughing)"
11239960,11243440," We're just trying to answer them quickly"
11243440,11245200," to get things like out of the system."
11245200,11248240," Daniel G, this one must have been curated by Dan"
11248240,11251440," because he is constantly hounding me about this."
11251440,11253440," Have you ever done a behind the scenes for the WAN show"
11253440,11254280," and going over there?"
11254280,11255120," - Oh no, that was me."
11255120,11256680," - Oh okay, yeah."
11256680,11259760," Dan has answered this one, I think more than once,"
11259760,11260800," that he wants to do it."
11260800,11263360," And I keep saying I don't think it's an LTT video."
11263360,11264360," You know what?"
11264360,11266440," I, is Dan in your shot?"
11266440,11267360," I don't know."
11267360,11268200," - I'm not sure."
11268200,11269040," - Oh okay."
11269040,11271000," Well, you guys can remind him next show"
11271000,11273000," 'cause he's not at the chair right now."
11273000,11275760," Yes, it's green lit as a float plane exclusive."
11275760,11279320," He can do a little tour of his battle station back there."
11279320,11281320," And maybe he can explain in more detail"
11281320,11284200," how he plans to do that job remotely."
11284200,11287600," 'Cause there's sliders and there's dials"
11287600,11289240," and there's key pads."
11289240,11293020," I don't really understand how he's gonna be doing that."
11293020,11296800," Oh, this is a fun one."
11296800,11299760," Chris C says, \"I know you mentioned"
11299760,11302080," \"about trying to find a way to raise capital."
11302080,11304440," \"Have you ever thought about doing something like Hacksmith"
11304440,11308400," \"where they sell memorabilia from the video creation process?\""
11308400,11310520," Oh okay, I thought I was gonna have more"
11310520,11313360," to contribute to this than I ended up having."
11313360,11318400," I actually suggested to James back when he was approaching"
11318400,11323400," 10 million subscribers that he do like a memorabilia slash,"
11323400,11329320," like he make part of the event talking about"
11329320,11330960," some of the early days of Hacksmith"
11330960,11334280," and how he was funding it by going to the dollar store"
11334280,11337080," and buying little tiny cutting boards"
11337080,11342080," and laser engraving them with like cool graphics and slogans."
11342080,11345040," He still had some of them kicking around"
11345040,11346400," and I asked for one 'cause I was like,"
11346400,11349320," \"This is such a cool little piece of Hacksmith history.\""
11349320,11352760," 'Cause he could sell them for like 20, 30 bucks on Etsy."
11352760,11354640," And it was like a game of thrones,"
11354640,11357480," like dragon looking thing and said dinner is coming"
11357480,11360040," on this like cute little cutting board."
11360040,11363000," And I was like, \"Man, you should tell that story"
11363000,11368000," \"about the early days and you should do like a drop"
11368000,11371000," \"of little cutting boards 'cause there was still time.\""
11371000,11373160," I think he was at like nine million something."
11373160,11374800," I don't think he ended up doing it"
11374800,11376960," but that's what I thought you were asking about"
11376960,11380720," like doing kind of commemorative stuff like that."
11380720,11382560," But no, I think they actually do sell"
11382560,11383840," some of the stuff they create."
11383840,11385560," And I think that's what you're talking about."
11385560,11389440," We've done some blind auctions at LTX"
11390280,11392280," for like BC Children's Hospital."
11392280,11395960," And I think we've worked with extra life on"
11395960,11398480," functioning off like, 'cause I'm like,"
11398480,11400160," we did the bomb piece for example."
11400160,11402120," Yeah, there was a couple of other things as well."
11402120,11404840," We have some stuff that we have queued up for LTX this year"
11404840,11408480," but we've never, aside from garage sales"
11408480,11411760," where we were just selling stuff to get rid of it,"
11411760,11414960," to get it out of our hair that we had used in videos"
11414960,11418120," but we weren't really emphasizing that."
11418120,11420560," I don't think we've ever really done it, no."
11420560,11425480," Kyle asks, \"Will you implement where you can only log"
11425480,11427440," into accounts from the company network,"
11427440,11429720," add workplace plug-in scanning employee inboxes"
11429720,11433160," for phishing emails and malicious attachments, et cetera?\""
11433160,11437240," I think that's a better question for our new CTO,"
11437240,11438520," Mr. Luc LaFreniere."
11438520,11441720," Yeah, a lot of this stuff, like pretty much everything"
11441720,11446720," you said and more has been road mapped."
11446720,11449320," And road mapped, we're dealing with--"
11449320,11451760," A lot of it was road mapped already just as part of"
11451760,11454400," onboarding and figuring out where the heck things were at"
11454400,11456280," but it takes time."
11456280,11457680," It takes a lot of time."
11457680,11461120," And we're dealing with this migration off of LastPass"
11461120,11462960," for relatively obvious reasons"
11462960,11464440," if you've been paying attention to the space"
11464440,11465760," at all for a while now."
11465760,11470760," And that was like many thousands of passwords, many."
11473440,11476720," And that was what a lot of people immediately freaked out"
11476720,11480840," and were worried about caused the recent break-in"
11480840,11482480," but it was actually completely unrelated."
11482480,11483680," I had nothing to do with that."
11483680,11485360," So that was our focus first was like,"
11485360,11487320," \"Hey, there is this massive breach at LastPass."
11487320,11489880," We should figure this out immediately.\""
11489880,11493840," So we aren't even technically 100% done that."
11493840,11496680," There's still a lot of growing pains"
11496680,11497840," to do with that migration."
11497840,11501080," And then this happened, but yeah, like these are all things"
11501080,11502520," we thought of."
11502520,11506680," One of the small unfortunate artifacts of this situation"
11506680,11509400," was the antivirus solution that we have"
11509400,11513600," actually did flag it but it wasn't set"
11513600,11517120," to as aggressive of a level as it could have been"
11517120,11518880," because we didn't previously,"
11518880,11520840," even now, I mean the team hasn't grown yet."
11520840,11523920," I'm still working on hiring an infrastructure person."
11523920,11528520," We didn't have the bandwidth to not as an internet bandwidth"
11528520,11532880," and as in like time to be able to address"
11532880,11536160," the level of false positives that would have been coming through"
11536160,11539640," because it was a lot of false positives, which is like fine."
11539640,11541280," It's a more aggressive level."
11541280,11544600," But that level would have stopped this"
11544600,11545800," because it did detect it."
11545800,11548000," The antivirus solution, we have detected it,"
11548000,11551560," but it was like, this doesn't match a signature"
11551560,11553240," for something that we've seen before,"
11553240,11556760," but this thing is sketchy and it looks very similar"
11556760,11561440," and it sent a warning to the user"
11561440,11564080," and it sent a warning through email,"
11564080,11566320," but systems were just, everything's kind of"
11566320,11570760," in a weird limbo place right now, so it slipped through."
11570760,11574440," - Can I just say shout out Conrad and the floatplane team"
11574440,11577240," for only losing messages sometimes?"
11577240,11580960," Going over to my screen here."
11580960,11585000," You know how I said this was fixed now, it seemed?"
11585000,11586360," It's not."
11586360,11590240," Here's a 100 Euro Super Chat"
11590240,11592680," that is not in the archive."
11592680,11596600," So when this expires from here, it will be gone."
11596600,11600640," Also, I doubt that this is the number of Super Chats today"
11600640,11602760," because it's been quite a long stream."
11602760,11605160," It's still fucking broken."
11605160,11606720," - This is the only time ever."
11606720,11609680," It's been a perfect track record up until this point."
11609680,11610520," - What?"
11610520,11611360," - For merch from the whole."
11611360,11612360," - Oh, I thought you meant for Super Chats."
11612360,11613200," - Oh, sorry, not for that."
11613200,11615160," - 'Cause I was gonna say that's what you're talking about."
11615160,11617080," That's why we developed merch messages"
11617080,11619160," 'cause Super Chats were broken."
11619160,11622200," I've had people accuse me of making that up"
11622200,11624080," or something, I don't know."
11624080,11625280," Anyway, thanks Megalleg."
11625280,11628840," No, no, it's actually broken."
11628840,11631200," I don't know how it's even possible."
11631200,11634080," So yeah, all right, one time,"
11634080,11635560," merch message just falls apart."
11635560,11639040," We're sorry, but dang it,"
11639040,11640720," I'm giving the team a pass on this one"
11640720,11643120," 'cause it's more reliable than Google's product."
11643120,11644920," - And Dan's resolving it right now."
11644920,11646080," We didn't lose the data."
11646080,11648480," It just became a lot more complicated"
11648480,11651560," and difficult and tedious to parse through."
11651560,11653960," And we're already back online in the normal way,"
11653960,11654800," so that's working."
11654800,11656120," So yeah, I don't know."
11656120,11657560," Things are gonna go wrong."
11657560,11659280," That's another thing that like,"
11659280,11660120," if I remember correctly,"
11660120,11661440," you did address well in your video,"
11661440,11663960," but like with the hack that happened to us,"
11663960,11665440," like things are gonna go wrong."
11665440,11668160," We 100% could have had better stuff in place."
11668160,11670360," - On average, I get hacked once every five years."
11670360,11672600," - So bad."
11672600,11674840," We'll make that better."
11674840,11676440," We'll make that better."
11676440,11679760," We, I've even like talked to Wendell about it already."
11679760,11681840," And he shared the same opinion."
11681840,11684720," Like it's, you can do as much as you want policy-wise."
11684720,11686760," We can do as much as we want education-wise."
11686760,11688160," And we should and we will."
11688160,11690640," And that was another thing that was road-mapped already,"
11690640,11692000," but like we just haven't been able to get to it."
11692000,11692920," - But we're not gonna claim"
11692920,11695440," that anything is ever unexplitable."
11695440,11697640," - No, yeah, there will always be holes."
11697640,11699480," And there's the whole Swiss cheese approach thing"
11699480,11700880," that we mentioned when we were talking"
11700880,11702200," about Goats video on Tarkov,"
11702200,11703160," we're like with security."
11703160,11705280," We wanna just have a lot of layers"
11705280,11707200," because each layer is gonna have some amount of holes."
11707200,11708440," So you try to have as many as you can,"
11708440,11709880," that hopefully something can't get through."
11709880,11713440," But something could get through at pretty much any time."
11713440,11716920," But we need to be, man, what did he call it?"
11716920,11718720," It's a phrase I've heard it a bunch of times before,"
11718720,11720560," but my brain is not working."
11720560,11722000," - We need to be hard."
11722000,11723680," - Effectively that, yeah."
11723680,11725000," - Yeah."
11725000,11725840," - Hardened."
11725840,11726680," - What is it called?"
11726680,11727680," It's like not--"
11727680,11729400," - Well, I have that little thing I need to talk"
11729400,11732280," to some of our float plane team about here real quick."
11732280,11734600," First of all, Conrad says lose messages."
11734600,11735760," What are you talking about?"
11735760,11737320," - Anti-fragile."
11737320,11739360," - We've got them back, sort of."
11739360,11740200," - Yeah, sort of."
11740200,11741360," - You're right, Conrad."
11741360,11743000," - That I should have been more fair to you."
11743000,11744480," Also, Jaden, two things."
11744480,11746440," Number one, why are you still working?"
11746440,11750760," And number two, what is this feature you're testing?"
11750760,11751600," - What is it?"
11751600,11755600," - Hold on a second, let me just bring this up."
11755600,11757320," - My eyes are bad, I can see that."
11757320,11759160," - Okay."
11759160,11761000," What is this--"
11761000,11762240," - And moderation bias."
11762240,11764720," - Hey, moderation bot, whenever I open the live page,"
11764720,11766640," the app crashes, moderation bot."
11766640,11769160," Hi, Jaden, there is currently an update available"
11769160,11770920," that fixes the live stream crashing issue."
11770920,11773200," Please try to update to the latest version."
11773200,11776560," Are you not only, are you experimenting with features"
11776560,11781560," live in the chat while we are in a crisis here, Jaden?"
11781560,11783120," Also, go to bed."
11783120,11784960," - It's late."
11784960,11788440," - Defense and death."
11788440,11790720," No, anti-fragile, anti-fragile."
11790720,11792840," I always like to term anti-fragile"
11792840,11795760," and Wendell mentioned it when he was talking to me about--"
11795760,11799240," - The whole world could stand to be a little more anti-fragile."
11799240,11800080," - Yeah."
11800080,11801280," - But that's a whole separate conversation."
11801280,11804400," - Yeah, so like, that's something that needs to happen"
11804400,11805800," is not the user's fault."
11805800,11807360," - AJ and Jonathan piping up."
11807360,11808200," - We're still working too."
11808200,11809960," Kate, no, for real, go guys."
11809960,11810800," - Those boys are--"
11810800,11817480," - The official response is something"
11817480,11818320," whatever he's gonna say."
11818320,11819760," - Please log your hours correctly."
11819760,11821880," - Yeah, there you go."
11821880,11823680," I messaged AJ earlier."
11823680,11826440," - You're supposed to prove OT."
11826440,11827800," - Oh, well, you got 'em."
11827800,11835080," I did message AJ earlier 'cause I didn't,"
11835080,11837920," at that point in time, it was only contractors"
11837920,11839360," and AJ working."
11839360,11842920," And contractors, I don't think I actually even can"
11842920,11845200," let alone have to, and I knew AJ was working,"
11845200,11847760," so I told him, like, make sure you claim your OT."
11847760,11849320," Blah, blah, blah, blah."
11849320,11852040," Now there's other people, including Dan and Conrad,"
11852040,11853720," that are working, so yeah."
11853720,11857360," Sounds good."
11857360,11859040," - Just everyone log your hours correctly."
11859040,11861040," That's all I have to say about that."
11861040,11864400," You know, HR and accounting, know all the details"
11864400,11866400," of how you're supposed to be logging your hours."
11866400,11869720," - I massively enjoy working with people"
11869720,11871880," who will rise to the challenge and get stuff done."
11871880,11873880," You should also be paid for it, so yeah."
11873880,11877440," - Okay."
11877440,11878920," - Well, Dan came back with a laptop."
11878920,11880520," - How did you do that that fast?"
11880520,11883240," - He read them, apparently."
11883240,11884160," Okay."
11884160,11888080," - He put the hydrophobic hat on,"
11888080,11890920," and somehow that just dialed them in."
11890920,11891760," - Okay."
11891760,11892600," - Wow."
11892600,11893440," - We are not gonna be able to get through"
11893440,11894520," all of these regardless, Dan."
11894520,11896840," And I don't want you to feel like it was wasted effort,"
11896840,11899360," you know, finding the ones."
11899360,11901920," But we will not address them all."
11901920,11903960," I don't think it's possible."
11903960,11907800," Since the problem, we've had 270."
11907800,11908640," - Well, okay."
11908640,11910960," Yeah."
11910960,11914400," - He doesn't have to address, he can't address any of those"
11914400,11918120," in a show on screen or text replies data."
11918120,11920480," But he can curate ones out of there,"
11920480,11922040," and we can keep working on this."
11922040,11923560," If you wanna keep going through curated,"
11923560,11924760," I'll keep doing what I was doing."
11924760,11925680," - Oh my goodness."
11925680,11928040," - These are done and have been curated."
11928040,11930200," - Okay, do you wanna hit us with some urge messages then?"
11930200,11931040," - Yeah, sure."
11931040,11931880," - Let's do it."
11931880,11934520," - Unfortunately, I can't see the name."
11934520,11935360," - Sure."
11935360,11936200," - You can just get your message."
11936200,11937040," - All right."
11937040,11940400," Okay, first one is what training will you be implementing"
11940400,11942380," to prevent further intrusion?"
11942380,11945520," - Oh yeah, so we sort of talked about this earlier."
11945520,11949280," There will be training/education stuff that is coming in,"
11949280,11953840," but our main goal is to make our systems and our approaches"
11953840,11955480," and our processes and stuff like that"
11955480,11957360," as anti-fragile as possible."
11957360,11959560," 'Cause you can do as much training as you want,"
11959560,11962520," but it's not gonna completely solve the problem."
11962520,11963760," - I definitely want the thing"
11963760,11965480," where we try to fish our own employees"
11965480,11967480," and then anyone who clicks on something."
11967480,11968320," - Yeah, it's totally a goal."
11968320,11969480," - Yeah, okay, cool."
11969480,11973280," - Yeah, I've had a bunch of people reach out being like,"
11973280,11975080," \"Oh, I can do pen testing on your organization.\""
11975080,11977480," It's like, great."
11977480,11979280," We might be interested in that at some point."
11979280,11980600," We're definitely gonna do our own version of that."
11980600,11982880," - We have some very low hanging fruit to pick first."
11982880,11984320," - But we know what we need to work on"
11984320,11985320," for the next little bit."
11985320,11986240," - Yeah, okay, for sure."
11986240,11987560," - Cool, yeah."
11987560,11990600," - Okay, next up, \"Look, we haven't had a meet the team"
11990600,11992920," \"from you yet, so what is something you hate"
11992920,11996200," \"for no good reason other than you just hate it?\""
11996200,11998840," Don't say lie to me."
11998840,12000160," - Do you ever meet the team?"
12000160,12002040," Like, do hosts normally have a meet the team?"
12002040,12002880," - Yeah, I'm changing."
12002880,12004800," - I feel like people have met me a lot."
12004800,12006800," - Yeah, yeah, we've done hosts before."
12006800,12009840," - Okay, what do I hate for no good reason?"
12009840,12011340," - Hate for no good reason."
12011340,12015480," - I feel like I have reasons for things that I hate."
12015480,12017000," Maybe they're not good ones,"
12017000,12018080," but I feel like I have them."
12018080,12019320," - I hate dead things."
12019320,12021120," - Dead things."
12021120,12022680," - Yeah, I just have like necrophobia."
12022680,12023520," - Oh, okay."
12023520,12024360," - Yeah, anything dead."
12024360,12026800," I'm more afraid of a dead spider than a live one."
12026800,12028520," Like I just, I don't like it."
12028520,12029360," - Interesting."
12029360,12030920," - Yeah, I don't feel like I have--"
12030920,12032560," - Whenever I watch scenes in movies,"
12032560,12034800," where like, you know, Iron Man dies or whatever,"
12034800,12036760," and then like, when a pultraol leans down"
12036760,12039440," and kisses him, spoiler alert, Iron Man dies."
12039440,12043460," (laughing)"
12043460,12045960," Okay, it's late."
12046960,12048720," Okay, we are supposed to spoiler alert things,"
12048720,12051440," but also if you don't know that, it's fine."
12051440,12052280," It's fine."
12052280,12053120," - You probably weren't gonna watch the scenes."
12053120,12055200," - So he's like dead, and she like leans in"
12055200,12056760," and you know, like kisses him one last time,"
12056760,12060480," and I'm just like, like I can feel my bile rising."
12060480,12062680," Like, it's one of those things I've like,"
12062680,12065400," I've thought about, you know, 'cause like, I don't know."
12065400,12068960," Maybe this isn't normal, but like,"
12068960,12071080," I'll have like, nightmares sometimes"
12071080,12072960," that like, you Von dies in your sleep,"
12072960,12075040," and like, I wake up next to her,"
12075040,12077640," and like, the only thing I can think of is like,"
12077640,12081360," oh, it's like, getting away as fast as pot,"
12081360,12084560," like I wouldn't be like, like clutching and sobbing,"
12084560,12085400," I don't think."
12085400,12086240," - That's interesting."
12086240,12087560," - I've never gone through it, but I do not."
12087560,12088560," - I mentioned dead things."
12088560,12089960," - Earlier in the show about how we have tons"
12089960,12092200," of like, freakishly similar things,"
12092200,12093200," that's not one of them."
12093200,12094160," - Okay, yeah."
12094160,12095200," - So you're into dead things, so."
12095200,12096880," - I'm not into it, but like,"
12096880,12099040," I was there when my grandfather passed away."
12099040,12099880," - Right, okay."
12099880,12101480," - And he was freakishly strong,"
12101480,12103400," I don't know how much I told you about this,"
12103400,12106360," but the nurses were very impressed"
12106360,12108960," because we found, he couldn't talk near the end,"
12108960,12111960," but he found a way to communicate through"
12111960,12113920," just like, strengthening things."
12113920,12115840," So you like, hold his hands,"
12115840,12119520," and he would like, move you in a certain way for yes,"
12119520,12121360," and he'd move you in a certain way for no."
12121360,12122200," - Right."
12122200,12125360," - And he was really strong, so he could like,"
12125360,12127560," actually give you like, quite a push."
12127560,12129440," So there's one time I made some comment about,"
12129440,12131320," and he could see, so I made some comment"
12131320,12132600," about how I needed a haircut,"
12132600,12134840," and he just like, almost tossed me."
12134840,12135680," (laughing)"
12135680,12136920," Which was hilarious, but like,"
12136920,12139640," I was holding his hand."
12139640,12140520," - Right."
12140520,12144440," - And I was okay, like obviously I was sad,"
12144440,12147880," but like, I didn't get any visceral reaction."
12147880,12149960," - Think of it, with my OPPA,"
12149960,12153200," I was, with my OPPA, I was there too,"
12153200,12156160," and in the like, the very like moment,"
12156160,12157720," you know, yeah, I was okay,"
12157720,12162200," but I didn't wanna go near him after, for sure."
12162200,12166600," I helped the more guy carry him out."
12166600,12169080," I was a proud moment for me to be honest."
12169080,12169920," - Okay."
12169920,12173640," - It felt, I don't know if this is gonna be interpreted"
12173640,12176000," the right way, but it felt good."
12176000,12177400," I was happy to do it."
12177400,12180000," I felt like I was doing my grandpa a favor."
12180000,12180840," - Some poor guys."
12180840,12182880," - The more guy was like, I can do it myself more or less,"
12182880,12184320," but I was like, it feels right."
12184320,12185240," - Yeah, to help."
12185240,12186160," - I don't know, whatever."
12186160,12187000," - I don't think I could've done it again."
12187000,12188480," - Things get weird with you, man."
12188480,12189600," - I don't, yeah."
12189600,12192400," - I didn't expect, yeah, like I'm not saying anything"
12192400,12196400," about that, it just felt appropriate for me to do that."
12196400,12197240," I don't know why."
12197240,12199040," - I wasn't needed, maybe I'd have felt differently"
12199040,12199880," if I'd--"
12199880,12201520," - I also wasn't needed in that moment."
12201520,12204040," That dude had a hand on it, but--"
12204040,12204880," - Oh, okay."
12204880,12206400," - He had like a whole method for everything and stuff."
12206400,12209440," He was on it, but I just felt like I should help."
12209440,12210280," - Okay."
12210280,12211120," - I don't know."
12211120,12213120," Anyways, on to more positive topics."
12213120,12214240," - Yeah, sure, we could do that."
12214240,12216840," - Oh, I did answer the question."
12216840,12217680," I don't know."
12219040,12220320," I feel like things that I hate,"
12220320,12221640," I usually have a reason for it."
12221640,12223200," Can you think of anything?"
12223200,12224480," - That I hate for, well, that means the dead things."
12224480,12225320," - No, for me."
12225320,12226160," - Oh, for you."
12226160,12228040," Oh, something you hate for no reason."
12228040,12231320," I don't know if you hate much."
12231320,12232400," - I don't think so."
12232400,12233240," - Ah."
12233240,12239640," - I can think of some things that I'm against,"
12239640,12241560," but I can't think of for no reason."
12241560,12244680," I don't think I'm just like,"
12244680,12247460," irrationally against anything too much."
12248560,12251080," - Yeah, I can't think of anything off the top of my head."
12251080,12251920," - Yeah."
12251920,12252720," - All right, moving on."
12252720,12253840," Sorry."
12253840,12256160," - Well, you'll probably like this one then."
12256160,12257800," High Linus, High Luke."
12257800,12260400," Greetings from a new float plane subscriber."
12260400,12261240," - Hey."
12261240,12262080," - Questions from Luke."
12262080,12262920," - This view."
12262920,12263760," - Questions for Luke."
12263760,12266200," How challenging was it to scale up float plane"
12266200,12269320," given the sudden influx of so many new subscribers?"
12269320,12275120," - That again, that part's actually not that big of a deal."
12275120,12279960," The infrastructure slash DevOps team is really good,"
12279960,12281120," has been doing a great job."
12281120,12284400," The problems that we've been having,"
12284400,12286840," the things that people have been seeing going on"
12286840,12291840," are more related to somewhat problematic recent updates"
12291840,12294800," that we've had, which is fairly normal,"
12294800,12298880," and just extremely unfortunate timing."
12298880,12302800," So, yeah, I don't know."
12304600,12305680," It is what it is."
12305680,12310040," We knew this stuff might happen,"
12310040,12312880," but that's just kind of part of doing this."
12312880,12313720," I don't know."
12313720,12316040," We're not an absolutely insanely enormous team."
12316040,12318480," We gotta do it again."
12318480,12320120," So, things did happen."
12320120,12322200," They just unfortunately happened right now."
12322200,12323480," But we'll recover."
12323480,12325200," We've already recovered a ton."
12325200,12326880," Like, they're literally working on it right now."
12326880,12328360," There have been significant improvements"
12328360,12330200," that have happened during the show."
12330200,12333120," A video was launched during this show."
12333120,12334120," Do you know about that?"
12334120,12334960," Yes."
12334960,12337160," There was a MAC address published during the show."
12337160,12339120," I mean, I did kind of ask you about that."
12339120,12340400," Like, are you letting people know"
12340400,12341960," that there's a problem with notifications?"
12341960,12343320," And you're like, nope."
12343320,12344720," I was like, okay."
12344720,12346760," Well, like, how are we gonna..."
12346760,12348600," I mean, you could have posted in general in teams."
12348600,12349520," No, I know."
12349520,12351040," But like, what's gonna..."
12351040,12353760," We're just gonna queue up like an insane amount later."
12353760,12355560," They're not gonna get things at the same time as YouTube."
12355560,12356640," That makes them unhappy."
12356640,12359920," That makes the float plane people very unhappy."
12359920,12360920," We know that."
12360920,12363440," We don't do it on purpose."
12363440,12365240," Yeah, it's usually like, you know..."
12365240,12368080," Like, this Wanchow archive will be later."
12368080,12369440," Oh, yeah."
12369440,12371200," It just takes a long time to process"
12371200,12374760," because we don't have hundreds of millions of dollars"
12374760,12375880," of servers, yeah."
12375880,12377040," Doing ourselves."
12377040,12377880," So it takes a minute."
12377880,12379720," And then that problem exacerbates"
12379720,12382520," as the Wanchow just keeps getting longer and longer."
12382520,12385680," So, yeah, this one is."
12385680,12386520," Oops."
12386520,12388080," I accidentally just clicked show on one"
12388080,12390240," that I intended to reply to."
12390240,12392240," If there was a sport that I could pick up today"
12392240,12397040," as an adult, a team sport, it would be a roller hockey."
12397040,12399800," I think I would get absolutely annihilated"
12399800,12403960," because I'm not very big, but I just love rollerblading"
12403960,12406440," and I've always loved hockey even though I suck."
12406440,12409920," But this was aspirational, okay?"
12409920,12413520," It wasn't what sport are you going to start playing tomorrow?"
12413520,12414360," So that's what I chose."
12414360,12415200," Yeah."
12415200,12417360," Okay, up next."
12417360,12418200," How many?"
12418200,12419040," How many sport for me?"
12419040,12420640," Yeah, a team sport, a new team sport"
12420640,12421600," that you could pick up today."
12421600,12422600," What would you choose?"
12422600,12427400," Mm."
12427400,12430040," A problem with this is a lot of the things"
12430040,12433120," that I would want to do would be very body breaking."
12433120,12435360," And I already have enough of those problems."
12435360,12436200," So,"
12436200,12444280," define pickup."
12444280,12445760," What level of good are we?"
12445760,12448800," You're just going to have to choose this."
12448800,12451040," They're obviously not going to be able to respond."
12451040,12452600," What level of good are we?"
12452600,12454960," Yeah, like by pickup,"
12454960,12457240," do they mean like, can I like play to competitive level?"
12457240,12458400," I would think so, yeah."
12458400,12459880," Okay, so probably badminton."
12459880,12460960," Really? Oh, okay."
12460960,12463480," Because I have people that I would want to play with"
12463480,12464320," at that point."
12464320,12465360," It's fun. Yeah."
12465360,12466360," It's really fun."
12466360,12467360," I enjoy it."
12467360,12469120," And there's people that I would want to play with"
12469120,12472000," which adds a social aspect to it, which is very cool."
12472000,12474320," There's a lot of other sports that I could put in there."
12474320,12477200," The social side is what incentivizes me to do it at all."
12477200,12478960," That's what helps me stay in shape."
12478960,12482000," It's like, if I don't go, I'm letting down my friends"
12482000,12485120," because I'm not paying my portion of the rental fee tonight"
12485120,12486720," and everyone has to pay more."
12486720,12490640," So even if I like, kind of don't feel like it, I go."
12490640,12494400," Which, and because I know everyone and I want to beat them,"
12494400,12495600," I go hard."
12495600,12499600," And so it's just a really different level from just like,"
12499600,12502640," trying to motivate myself to just like do pushups or something."
12502640,12503760," Yeah. Yeah."
12503760,12505520," If I didn't have social connections,"
12505520,12508480," which would benefit badminton, I'd probably say,"
12508480,12512160," actually either roller hockey or--"
12512160,12513440," Rollerball. I like that too."
12513440,12514880," Or--"
12514880,12515920," It was called ski ball."
12515920,12517200," And it's not really a team sport."
12517200,12521280," The funny part is, ball had nothing to do with what I was"
12521280,12522000," even going to say."
12522000,12523360," That just came out of nowhere."
12523360,12524960," Because I wasn't going to say ball hockey."
12524960,12525360," Curling."
12525360,12526880," I was going to say ice hockey."
12526880,12527840," Oh, OK."
12527840,12529360," Curling, I--"
12529360,12531840," It doesn't count as pick up because--"
12531840,12532320," Yeah."
12532320,12533600," I play once a year."
12533600,12536960," My dad's also like, my dad's going to either--"
12536960,12538880," I don't remember if his provincials or nationals,"
12538880,12540160," but he's going to one of them."
12540160,12542000," They have custom jackets on."
12542000,12544400," And everything he has his name on a custom jacket,"
12544400,12546320," he's sponsored by some company."
12546320,12548160," He's crazy. He's really good."
12548160,12550800," It's actually like nuts."
12550800,12553600," We often like--"
12553600,12555600," So we play in this thing called the novice bonds--"
12555600,12556160," Bondspeal."
12556160,12557920," For curling is effectively tournament."
12557920,12561200," And we play in the novice bondsfield because my brother,"
12561200,12563200," my uncle, and I don't actually play."
12563200,12565600," We just play once a year at this novice tournament."
12565600,12566720," And then my dad plays."
12566720,12569440," But my dad leads our team."
12569440,12572640," And how it's set up is there's a certain amount of years"
12572640,12575200," combined across all the members of your team."
12575200,12580240," How many years have they played curling?"
12580240,12582240," How many years have they curled?"
12582240,12583280," Yeah, that's a way to say it."
12583280,12589600," So I think they started adding years to myself,"
12589600,12591600," my brother, and my uncle because they're like,"
12591600,12593040," eventually you guys have to stop doing this"
12593040,12594080," because we win all the time."
12594080,12596080," [LAUGHTER]"
12596080,12600000," The amount of years that they've started making us take on,"
12600000,12604480," despite us never actually playing for any amount of years."
12604480,12607280," And then with the years that my dad is just naturally gaining,"
12607280,12609200," we're going to be pushed out of that tournament eventually,"
12609200,12610000," which kind of sucks."
12610000,12614560," But we just win all the time and we relatively often win"
12614560,12617200," because my dad is the last person to curl."
12617200,12619600," And he'll just like, sink one."
12619600,12620960," And it'll be brutal."
12620960,12623120," Like they're going to score like six points."
12623120,12626000," And then on the last throw that we have ever,"
12626000,12628320," it'll just be like, \"Mooooop!\""
12628320,12628720," We win."
12628720,12629280," [LAUGHTER]"
12629280,12631280," It's just so hard taking us."
12631280,12633920," It's crazy."
12633920,12636480," Oh man, there was one year where"
12636480,12640000," there's three different ways that you can receive money."
12640000,12643120," There's how you place in the tournament."
12643120,12644800," So if you win, you make some money."
12644800,12649680," There's something called the Blind Calcutta,"
12649680,12650640," I believe is what it's called."
12650640,12652480," I don't know what that necessarily means."
12652480,12655680," But if you enter the Blind Calcutta, you pay into it"
12655680,12658160," and then you get a random team assigned to you."
12658160,12660240," And if that team wins, you make money."
12660240,12663200," And then there's a thing called Cool Shots,"
12663200,12666720," which is like shuffleboard, but they're curling rocks."
12666720,12669200," And it's your curling."
12669200,12670960," It's just like on a board."
12670960,12674240," And one year, we got ourselves in the Blind Calcutta."
12674240,12676720," We won the tournament."
12676720,12679120," So we won the Blind Calcutta, we won the tournament,"
12679120,12680560," and we won Cool Shots."
12680560,12682080," We won everything."
12682080,12685120," Yeah, I'd be a little resentful if I was,"
12685120,12688320," you know, someone else who thought I was pretty hot"
12688320,12689600," in curling and like,"
12689600,12693040," just this like family team comes in."
12693040,12695840," I'd be like, they probably practice like every night together."
12695840,12698720," The funniest part is we like don't have their own curling rink."
12698720,12701280," We don't even like show up the night before or the day before"
12701280,12703120," to like do a couple slides or anything."
12703120,12706400," Our first slide of every tournament is like an actual tournament slide."
12706400,12707520," Like it's just stupid."
12707520,12708880," Show off."
12709920,12710960," It's so funny."
12710960,12712800," Anyways, we're all like very competitive,"
12712800,12714560," so we're super into this whole thing."
12714560,12714960," It's great."
12714960,12718000," Anyways, more merch messages."
12718000,12718960," All right."
12718960,12722160," How many shirts do we have to buy to get more Dan Butt streams?"
12722160,12723600," I loved it today."
12723600,12725280," Oh, Dan Butt."
12725280,12727120," That's not how I interpreted that."
12727120,12730480," See if you said Besser Butt or Dan Sarah,"
12730480,12732320," I might have known what you were talking about,"
12732320,12734960," but Dan Butt is an entirely different thing."
12734960,12737120," I was wondering if you like picked something up"
12737120,12739680," in the back of the stream or something and flashed them but."
12739680,12740480," Yeah."
12740480,12744080," I popped in a few times to calm anxieties."
12744080,12745920," Yeah, I've seen a few people asking for that."
12745920,12749360," I mean, my feedback is like, oh, guys, everyone here is cool."
12749360,12752400," But we can't have everyone on camera constantly"
12752400,12754000," because we actually have stuff to do."
12754000,12755120," We got stuff to do, yeah."
12755120,12760240," So I mean, the idea of Sarah doing design streams like that"
12760240,12760880," is not a new one."
12760880,12763680," She's done them before and we'd love to do them,"
12763680,12766640," but it can't be all the time because it's not as,"
12766640,12768880," you know, productive for her and it means people can't come in"
12768880,12771120," and talk to her about confidential stuff and whatever else."
12771120,12773280," So it's not something we can do all the time,"
12773280,12776720," but I don't see it as being an impossibility."
12776720,12780960," Okay, next up, Linus."
12780960,12783680," Did you experience any residual anxiety"
12783680,12785600," reviewing your security footage?"
12785600,12788080," Also, would you say that the anxiety you were experiencing"
12788080,12791440," during the hacking affected your ability to handle the situation?"
12791440,12796000," Oh, I mean, yeah, definitely affected my ability"
12796000,12797360," to handle the situation."
12797360,12799280," Not as much as being sleep deprived"
12799280,12801360," and just generally being a bit of a scatterbrain though."
12801360,12804240," The sleep deprivation was the thing."
12804240,12806000," I think I was actually an advantage"
12806000,12807760," because I hadn't fully fallen asleep yet."
12807760,12808080," Right."
12808080,12810000," I was in bed, but I hadn't fully fallen asleep."
12810000,12810640," Oh, I was full around."
12810640,12814640," So my brain was fully, I was up and ready, basically."
12814640,12817360," I was like mildly tired because I hadn't slept yet, but that's all."
12817360,12820240," Okay, up next."
12820240,12823600," What do you weigh heavier for LTT outage?"
12823600,12826480," Wannick data loss or LTT being hacked?"
12826480,12832080," The data loss was more anxiety inducing for me."
12832080,12833440," Actually, no, hold on."
12833440,12835520," Well, that's only partially true."
12835520,12839920," If you ask LTT being hijacked,"
12839920,12842800," well, there were three separate incidents of that."
12842800,12847680," And the first one was devastating because in the first one,"
12847680,12852560," it wasn't common and there was no resources available."
12852560,12853200," Yeah."
12853200,12855120," I had never been through it before."
12855120,12857440," I thought everything was gone forever."
12857440,12863200," I was inconsolable."
12863200,12868960," The second and third times, I've known that there's"
12868960,12870560," probably some recourse."
12870560,12874400," Probably we have way better contacts at Google, YouTube now."
12874400,12877440," Like it's a different beast now."
12877440,12881920," I mean, we were talking earlier about how it happens regularly at this point,"
12881920,12886240," which isn't a good thing, but it is a reassuring thing, I guess."
12886240,12891440," So that's not even close to the second most anxious I ever was,"
12891440,12894480," which is when we had that major data loss on the Wannick server."
12894480,12897120," That raid failure."
12897120,12900400," Okay, next up."
12900400,12903360," Subscribe to floatplane in January."
12903360,12905840," And today's seal, the long-term customer."
12905840,12909040," Sorry, we all hugged floatplane too hard this evening."
12909920,12915040," Has the latest uptick in sub changed plans for future infrastructure expansions?"
12915040,12917280," Infrastructure expansion."
12917280,12919600," I just replied to the wrong merge message."
12919600,12925440," Whoever I replied, \"Lol, no\" to, the merge message that that was supposed to be was,"
12925440,12930080," \"Do you have any plans to do a review of the EK water block for Intel Arc graphics cards?\""
12930080,12931840," Oh, I replied to that too, that's why."
12931840,12933680," Ah, I see."
12933680,12937040," Yeah, we're having some too many cooks problems."
12937040,12939200," Actually, there's only 12 incoming merge messages."
12939200,12942480," We should probably relax and get that down to one person."
12942480,12942720," Okay."
12942720,12947600," What's the question I'm supposed to be answering right now, Dan?"
12947600,12950720," Are you going to make the servers bigger?"
12950720,12952720," Oh, infrastructure response."
12952720,12954880," Are there any new plans?"
12954880,12956000," As far as I know, no."
12956000,12959920," Again, like, it's obviously, there is some of that."
12959920,12965920," Mostly what it is, is there are issues that were uncovered with some of our recent updates,"
12965920,12972000," and they were made much more obvious by the increase in users."
12972000,12976720," Like, one of the issues right now that we are dealing with, maybe have dealt with,"
12976720,12979200," it was, I don't know, 100% know what's going on."
12979200,12982400," I've been trying to pay attention, but there's been changes during the show,"
12982400,12983840," so they might have already solved this."
12983840,12988320," But there was an issue with notifications where it would like crush the service when a notification went out."
12988320,12992640," It only crushed the service for line of sex,"
12992640,12994960," because we have so many people that the notifications go to."
12995920,13001840," Is our notification service like, do we need to scale up servers to handle that?"
13001840,13002880," No, there was a bug."
13002880,13006400," We can handle this much traffic."
13006400,13009840," Can we dynamically scale up infrastructure at this point?"
13009840,13011120," Some things, yes, some things, no."
13011120,13014400," But like, it actually should be fine."
13014400,13016880," We should be able to absorb this, for sure."
13016880,13021280," It's just certain bugs have been exaggerated due to the increase of users,"
13021280,13022960," which have made things a little bit worse."
13022960,13025600," But that is going to be resolved through fixing bugs,"
13025600,13028480," which is something you just always need to do."
13028480,13031840," So it's fairly normal operations, just again, unfortunate timing."
13031840,13036320," Folpling is legitimately, genuinely quite solid."
13036320,13037600," So it is what it is."
13037600,13039520," We will move on, we will be okay."
13039520,13042400," Okay, last one I've got my list here."
13042400,13044640," I've seen a shorter version of this screwdriver."
13044640,13048480," Any estimated time of arrival on what will be this year,"
13048480,13051200," or is it still unknown when it will be released?"
13052400,13053760," When's the stubby coming line?"
13053760,13055920," Nice stubby's here right now."
13055920,13056160," Sorry."
13056160,13059600," We are aiming for mid this year."
13059600,13063200," In our perfect magical world,"
13063200,13067360," Nick and Kyle are probably going to kill me for saying this."
13067360,13071760," In our perfect magical world, you will be able to buy one at LTX."
13071760,13073760," Oh, well, okay."
13073760,13075200," Yeah, don't, yeah."
13075200,13076640," Don't say that on stream."
13076640,13078160," I'm not committing to that though."
13078160,13080480," And they are especially-"
13080480,13081920," I'm hyperventilating for Kyle, right?"
13081920,13083920," Yeah, they are especially not committing to that."
13083920,13086560," We would love to hit-"
13086560,13088400," Oh, Kyle says soon in the chat there."
13088400,13089440," That's the official answer."
13089440,13090560," Cool, perfect, good."
13090560,13090960," Yes."
13090960,13092480," No, Kyle was still watching."
13092480,13096320," Everyone is okay."
13096320,13100720," This next MERS message is MERS message is from Kyle."
13100720,13102800," Oh, different Kyle."
13102800,13103120," Okay."
13103120,13106960," Will you implement where you can only log into accounts"
13106960,13110400," from the company network and workplace plug-in scanning employee?"
13110400,13111360," We already talked about this."
13111360,13112320," This is slightly different."
13112320,13113120," Oh, somebody didn't work."
13113120,13114960," Oh, we talked about something similar."
13114960,13115520," We can move on."
13115520,13116560," Yeah, it's effectively the same."
13116560,13117680," We've got a lot of stuff to get through."
13117680,13118880," If it's similar, we're going."
13118880,13119120," Yeah."
13119120,13119600," We're pushing."
13119600,13120560," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
13120560,13123280," Alberto, can you guys get Dan a picture in picture window"
13123280,13125040," and a decent background instead of a door?"
13125040,13128560," I think it suits me, don't you?"
13128560,13129360," Are you reading-"
13129360,13132160," I'm on your curated messages now."
13132160,13133200," MERS message."
13133200,13134320," Wait, you're done, your sheet?"
13134320,13134480," Yes."
13134480,13136800," Oh, well, that's fantastic."
13136800,13138800," Did you want more?"
13138800,13139760," I can shoot again."
13139760,13142080," It's kind of sad because I felt like-"
13142080,13143120," Here, hold on, I'll put you back up here."
13143120,13147600," I felt like we were heading towards uncharted territory."
13147600,13150800," I don't think the WAN show has ever made its way to Saturday before."
13150800,13153840," What time is it?"
13153840,13154160," Oh, I-"
13154160,13155200," Don't look at the time."
13155200,13156000," Is that a new goal?"
13156000,13156880," We're going to go to Saturday."
13156880,13157440," Well, I-"
13157440,13158160," We're going to Saturday."
13158160,13159280," I'm not saying it's a goal."
13159280,13162080," I'm just saying that if there were more merch messages curated,"
13162080,13163120," then it might happen."
13163120,13163760," Are you-"
13163760,13165040," You read all of them?"
13165040,13167920," Were you a little too aggressive with the curation filtering?"
13167920,13168720," I'm not sure."
13168720,13174720," A lot of them were responses to merch or stuff that you had already talked about."
13174720,13179120," A lot of people were curious who edited Linus' junk out of the video."
13179120,13186960," A massive outcry were people wishing us the best through this."
13186960,13188400," Thank you."
13188400,13189360," Support and love and-"
13189360,13189520," It's a very cool-"
13189520,13190640," And a very much-"
13190640,13192240," Most of the Linus' junk."
13192240,13196160," Sorry, I ruined a good moment."
13196160,13196720," You really did."
13196720,13198080," You're a junk."
13198080,13199680," Just made a bunch of money."
13199680,13203600," Hey, it ain't the first time."
13203600,13205680," Walk."
13205680,13208400," Yeah, no."
13208400,13210160," So a lot of support."
13210160,13210560," Oh, man."
13210560,13213200," A lot of support, which is really nice."
13213200,13214960," I can have another fine-tooth comb,"
13214960,13217920," but I think when we had that lost,"
13217920,13219600," I think I had about six to 10,"
13219600,13222560," infuriated, and like another six to 10."
13223280,13228000," Because I wasn't able to like do them because I had 100 in the queue,"
13228000,13229840," and I wasn't able to show them,"
13229840,13233200," and the back lock was 400, and everything just fell apart."
13233200,13236480," Am I going to get a decent background?"
13236480,13239200," No."
13239200,13246320," Well, there's a door there!"
13246320,13249440," It's an emergency exit, so we can't have a flight."
13249440,13251120," You can't walk the fire exit."
13251120,13251600," Yeah."
13251600,13252240," Yeah, literally."
13252240,13253200," Dan, do you want to--"
13253200,13253200," Oh, yeah."
13253200,13256800," Oh, wait. We can't see it because it's like a reflective sticker."
13256800,13260160," Can you grab your camera and get a little closer to it or something?"
13260160,13261520," Make it so we can read it."
13261520,13261920," That totally spot."
13261920,13263040," Put a little shade over it."
13263040,13264480," That's a fire door."
13264480,13265440," It's a fire door."
13265440,13268160," Like, we can't really change anything about it."
13268160,13269120," Is that up?"
13269120,13269600," Thanks, Dan."
13269600,13270400," That's helping a lot."
13270400,13270800," It's going to work."
13270800,13271760," It's like straight off."
13271760,13272240," Yeah, you know what?"
13272240,13272640," Forget it."
13272640,13273440," You've got to move the camera."
13273440,13274000," No, you're done."
13274000,13274480," You're done."
13274480,13275520," Opportunity loss."
13275520,13276080," No, no."
13276080,13278400," Fire door."
13278400,13279440," Keep closed."
13279440,13279920," Yeah."
13279920,13280000," Yeah."
13280000,13280480," Thank you."
13280480,13281600," Thank you for reading that for us."
13281600,13283680," I mean, that is kind of his job is to read things for us."
13283680,13284000," Yeah."
13284000,13285120," So good job."
13285120,13286080," Good job as well."
13286080,13288720," I'm putting this on your quarterly review."
13288720,13289920," Sometimes he changes."
13289920,13290880," Read good too."
13290880,13293200," And do others to talk."
13293200,13294160," Grammar good."
13294160,13294720," Excellent."
13294720,13296560," He also needs to type good."
13296560,13297680," Yeah, type good is good."
13297680,13298160," Yeah."
13298160,13298320," Yeah."
13298320,13299120," I can't spell though."
13299120,13300720," That's OK."
13300720,13302400," I don't think it matters."
13302400,13303600," That makes the passwords better."
13303600,13303920," All right."
13303920,13304640," Here's one another."
13304640,13308640," [LAUGHTER]"
13308640,13323840," Have you ever locked yourself out of an account that you just created or like a Windows install"
13323840,13328560," you just created by typing a password exactly the same way twice?"
13328560,13328560," Yeah."
13328560,13329120," Yeah."
13329120,13329600," Yeah."
13329600,13330720," I've definitely done that."
13330720,13332880," It's such a frustrating experience."
13332880,13337280," And then you sit there and you kind of go, maybe if I could type with the same way a third time,"
13337280,13338640," I could get an internship."
13338640,13341760," Yep."
13341760,13342640," That's totally a thing."
13342640,13343040," Oh, no."
13343040,13344080," OK."
13344080,13344560," OK."
13344560,13345600," Next up is from Matthew."
13345600,13351280," Luke, what's your opinion on kids using chat GPT in school for classes like English?"
13351280,13356800," I know I've used it to only help with research and outlining, but other kids use it to write"
13356800,13358000," full essays."
13358000,13358880," It's a weird one."
13358880,13361920," I thought this would be for maybe both of us instead of just me."
13361920,13363360," Because you actually have children."
13363360,13369120," I mostly subscribe to the calculator argument."
13369120,13373840," What I mean by the calculator argument is when we were in school."
13373840,13374080," Yeah."
13374080,13375600," I'm sure you had the same conversations."
13375600,13376640," Calculator's a way."
13376640,13380240," A lot of the teachers would make you put your calculators away because and the argument would"
13380240,13382800," be like, oh, you won't have one on you all the time."
13382800,13386400," Oh, how did that work out?"
13386400,13389440," So now with chat GPT, it's like, well, OK."
13390240,13395120," These types of tools are very obviously going to stay around."
13395120,13401440," However, is there something to be said for having life skills like being able like,"
13401440,13410720," I can drive my car without navigation, but I have heard from young people and people who"
13410720,13417440," know young people that they actually key in even places they go regularly every time they go."
13417440,13419040," I do sometimes just for traffic data."
13419040,13421360," And do not know how to get there without it."
13421360,13429840," So when your internet is out, is it useful to just have some basics?"
13429840,13430240," Yeah."
13430240,13434320," Well, like, I think one of the big directions that things are going in."
13434320,13439440," And I'm just like choosing to see this more optimistically."
13439440,13441840," But I think one of the big directions that people are going in is like"
13441840,13445680," a partnership thing, right?"
13446720,13448640," Microsoft's calling it co-pilot."
13448640,13448880," Yeah."
13448880,13450880," Like the idea is that you're working on things together."
13450880,13452480," You are a cyborg."
13452480,13456320," And like a lot of the demos by Microsoft, and I actually respected this a lot,"
13456320,13462640," is they were just constantly showing people getting outputs from whatever co-pilot thing it was in,"
13462640,13463920," Excel, Word, whatever."
13463920,13466480," And then it was immediately showing people editing them."
13466480,13470400," One of the biggest points in the video, they get it to write out a thing in Word."
13470400,13475200," And then it shows the person select a big chunk of it and just click delete and get rid of it."
13475200,13478160," And it makes a point of being like, look, they just changed it."
13478160,13480960," Because they're pushing like you need to edit these things."
13480960,13482800," You need to work with it and stuff like that."
13482800,13489360," So potentially using, even just having a section of your class, part of your course,"
13489360,13492720," being like, okay, we're going to intentionally use these new tools."
13492720,13495760," But you have to have someone on ownership over its output."
13495760,13496960," You need to edit it."
13496960,13498480," You need to improve it."
13498480,13500880," You need to guide it, those different types of things."
13501520,13505840," You have to be a part of this process because if you're not, then you're bringing no value."
13505840,13508240," Which is dangerous."
13508240,13508720," Yeah."
13508720,13514480," So learn how to, yes, you still need to learn the base skill."
13514480,13517680," But then if kids are using it, are they learning the base skill?"
13517680,13520480," Yeah, it's a complicated question."
13520480,13522320," That's why I said part of the class though."
13522320,13529200," Like you could having the challenge being original creation versus"
13530000,13534400," edited or guided creation is interesting to me, having both of them."
13534400,13541120," Like learning how in a calculator filled world, knowing how to do mental math is still beneficial."
13541120,13541920," Oh, for sure."
13541920,13545440," And knowing how to see a result that comes out of a calculator and go,"
13545440,13546320," ooh, that's wrong."
13546320,13547840," Yeah, where did I screw up the formula?"
13547840,13548320," It's good."
13548320,13548400," Yeah."
13548400,13551840," And like, yeah, maybe if it's within a very small margin, you might not notice."
13551840,13556320," But knowing some mental math, knowing how to estimate answers is going to lead you to"
13556320,13560960," realize, oh, I forgot a bracket or something weird happened in my input."
13560960,13564480," I didn't press plus one of those times."
13564480,13566560," I was trying to plus 20 things together."
13566560,13570080," So one number was one really long number and it gave me totally the wrong result."
13570080,13573680," Like being able to figure that out is really beneficial."
13573680,13576960," So somehow finding a way to teach that would be good."
13576960,13578320," I don't know."
13578320,13578960," It's really calm."
13578960,13580640," I need to try to use these tools more."
13580640,13583840," Like something that could have been pretty interesting would be to,"
13584640,13589280," you know, I could even do it because we often save versioned scripts."
13589280,13594880," So if I took the version that Jake brought me, which had all my notes and then all his sort of"
13594880,13599760," expansion on the notes that I had left and I just plunked that into chat GPT,"
13599760,13604960," like, hey, can you clean this up and turn it into a 15 minute video script?"
13604960,13607120," Definitely get four if you're going to do that."
13607120,13608160," Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure."
13608160,13610400," But I would like to see how close it gets, you know?"
13610400,13610640," Yeah."
13610640,13612320," Yeah."
13612320,13612640," Maybe."
13612640,13613920," Oh, you know what would be kind of cool?"
13614640,13624080," This would be a fun float plane exclusive doing a like a pre script review, like a notes from notes."
13624080,13624320," Okay."
13624320,13630000," I go into a script review or I script a video based on notes or something like that."
13630000,13632160," And then I feed it into GPT for."
13632160,13633040," And you host both of them."
13633040,13636640," I host both of them and see if people could guess which one was which."
13636640,13642000," I think they'll be able to get it just because I think the way that you write for yourself is"
13642000,13644320," going to be unique, but it'll still be very interesting."
13644320,13647360," But I could also tell it I wanted in the style of Linus Tech Tips."
13647360,13651680," And it's going to have an enormous body of data."
13651680,13653760," I mean, would it even I don't even know if it could sit through it."
13653760,13656560," It has a little bit of a signature in my opinion."
13656560,13658160," Okay."
13658160,13664000," But and like there's that's part of, you know, those tools that try to detect AI written things."
13664000,13666240," They're trying to."
13666240,13666800," Yeah, right."
13666800,13667200," Yeah."
13667200,13670480," So I still think it's super interesting, but yeah."
13671200,13671680," Yeah."
13671680,13673360," I know you do."
13673360,13675200," Here's a merge message that I curated."
13675200,13681600," Every week there's more to talk about with chat GPT and other machine learning and AI stuff."
13681600,13685600," I'd love to see a regular podcast with Luke and maybe guests talking about this rather"
13685600,13687200," than having Linus keep cutting it off."
13687200,13689520," I don't know how many podcasts we need."
13689520,13694960," I also think some of the cutting off, I think has maybe been a little too aggressive,"
13694960,13697360," but I think some of the cutting off has also been good."
13697360,13700880," Like, I don't want this show to become the AI podcast."
13700880,13701200," Yes."
13701200,13702480," That's why."
13702480,13704080," And I don't want us to talk about everything."
13704080,13708800," The reason why I pushed it last week was just those were actually insane massive,"
13708800,13710800," yes, huge moves."
13710800,13714880," And then this week, my, I wish I had more information on it because it might have been"
13714880,13718160," an interesting topic, but I haven't used any of the plugins."
13718160,13722000," And I've literally just seen like article headlines."
13722000,13723200," I've had no time."
13723200,13723840," The big thing."
13723840,13728560," It's been like, I'm just full transparency going to the washroom, flipping through Google News."
13728560,13729760," That's like all I have."
13729760,13731920," I'm really interested in it too, actually."
13731920,13737840," But what I'm doing is I'm monitoring the audience and I'm being a voice for the people who are"
13737840,13742880," maybe not as interested and feel like we should probably move on and talk about something else."
13742880,13744160," That's just fair and fine."
13744160,13750640," I'm trying to help guide the show more than I am trying to shut him up about AI because"
13750640,13752320," we talk about it on our personal time."
13752320,13752640," Yeah."
13752640,13754640," We don't even only talk about it on this show."
13754640,13755600," That's true."
13755600,13758560," And I don't tell him to stop talking about it when we're chatting about it."
13758560,13759040," Yeah."
13759040,13759360," Yeah."
13759360,13760640," So like I get it."
13760640,13761200," It's fine."
13761200,13761200," Yeah."
13761200,13762160," I don't."
13762160,13767120," There's so many little things happening in the space too where like if none of the big things"
13767120,13770480," were happening, maybe those things would be worth talking about all the time."
13770480,13770720," Yeah."
13770720,13773840," But because they're like, it's constant."
13773840,13780000," Man, the plug-in of Wolfram Alpha into chat GPT is like, holy cow, that's actually crazy."
13780000,13783840," Because one of its biggest flaws for a long time has been mathematical things."
13783840,13793280," So solving that is like, and solving that in just like, oh, we're done is crazy."
13793280,13795840," Like the the the jumps have just been wild."
13795840,13800480," So when there's these been these huge things like literally to be able to report on all the"
13800480,13805600," stuff happening in the AI space, you would need a channel releasing videos every single day."
13805600,13807840," And I know that because there are some already."
13808720,13814320," Like it's actually just just wild, really, really wild."
13814320,13815200," So I don't know."
13815200,13821920," I appreciate the the comments that I've seen a bunch of people cheering me on in that regard."
13821920,13822480," And I like that."
13822480,13823920," I don't know the answer to this."
13823920,13829280," Ryan says, as an OG float plane sub, I would be happy to upgrade past my."
13829280,13830080," You keep your status."
13830080,13832320," I think I know where the question is going."
13832320,13833040," Oh, okay."
13833040,13835120," So you keep your OG like tag."
13835120,13838240," We're an OG subscriber and we're not going to take that away."
13838240,13843040," Oh, now if they upgrade, can they later go, you know what?"
13843040,13844960," I really can't afford like $10 for 4K."
13844960,13848080," Oh, so you can always go back to three."
13848080,13849920," We're not we're not trying to like."
13849920,13851200," Yeah."
13851200,13854320," I mean, is that something you and I have talked about or?"
13854320,13855040," I'm pretty sure."
13855040,13855520," Yeah."
13855520,13855680," Yeah."
13855680,13856000," Sure."
13856000,13856160," Okay."
13856160,13858080," So with your OG, your OG forever."
13858080,13860960," Someone mentioned something in in."
13860960,13864400," Maybe this should be offline."
13865280,13866080," I don't know."
13866080,13868000," It's like at this point, right?"
13868000,13874160," Somebody mentioned something in float plane today saying that if OG members on the OG tier"
13874160,13876960," upgrade, maybe they should get like an emote."
13876960,13881440," Oh, and I thought it would be really funny if we had like a float plane,"
13881440,13883440," blue money bag emote."
13883440,13889520," So what we're just going, we're going full like gacha."
13889520,13890560," We're going full like."
13890560,13892160," I don't think it should be much."
13892160,13893760," I don't know if we should do it at all."
13893760,13895760," We've got money bag emotes."
13895760,13897200," I don't know if we should do it at all."
13897200,13900080," And if we do it, it shouldn't be like much."
13900080,13901760," It shouldn't be that different."
13901760,13903280," I'm down for one emote."
13903280,13904400," That's what like and I don't."
13904400,13905040," Yeah, sure."
13905040,13905600," Why not?"
13905600,13908960," Well, we'll see if people are strong objectors."
13908960,13909920," We'll we'll hear that."
13909920,13911360," We're both tired right now, but like."
13911360,13917680," It was hilarious how many people thought we were serious about paywalling dark mode on the"
13917680,13921280," site behind like an even higher $25 a month."
13921280,13922560," Yeah, that was we were joking."
13922560,13923600," We were joking."
13923600,13926560," The reason why we were laughing about it was because it was funny."
13926560,13928320," Not because we're maniacs."
13928320,13928800," Yeah."
13928800,13930880," Like evil evil people."
13930880,13933360," Making money is good."
13933360,13935040," That means we can expand teams."
13935040,13935680," We can grow."
13935680,13936720," We can do cool things."
13936720,13938240," We can build a better service."
13938240,13943520," But we don't need to be like just f***holes about it."
13943520,13946800," Like we'd have to do two shooting things."
13946800,13950160," We have a design for dark mode and it looks sick."
13951040,13953760," We are not in a state to release at this second."
13953760,13958080," There's also a bunch of just like browser plugins that can bring dark mode to flow"
13958080,13960560," plane for you very effectively and very easily."
13960560,13961840," So there's that option as well."
13961840,13964160," We'll get to it when we get to it."
13964160,13966160," When we do get to it, everyone will have it."
13966160,13971600," Speaking of evil though, we do have some NFT plans that we're going to be coming out with"
13971600,13972640," in the near future."
13972640,13974880," And I think you guys are going to be really excited about them."
13975840,13982560," Some people have expressed concern about the creation of NFTs,"
13982560,13986320," but then I was talking to you and you said there might be some way that's more like"
13986320,13987680," eco-friendly to make them now."
13987680,13991040," Yeah, my understanding is there's a non-power sucky way to do it."
13991040,13996960," We'll like make just for the people that are inevitably just freaked out when they heard that."
13996960,14002880," We'll make sure that if we're going to do it, it's in like a it's fine kind of way."
14002880,14005360," And we want to be extremely clear."
14006000,14008080," That we're doing it for a joke."
14008080,14010720," Oh, hold on a second."
14010720,14014160," We will take that conversation offline."
14014160,14018320," Oh, you want to make actual NFTs for like actual reasons?"
14018320,14019360," Well, hold on, hold on, hold on."
14019360,14020560," Can I just hold on?"
14020560,14021440," I know what you're going to type."
14021440,14024720," Oh boy."
14024720,14028160," Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on."
14028160,14032160," I think I'm a AJ just sent me a message."
14032720,14038080," This is moving way too fast."
14038080,14042800," OpenAI has just announced a new set of plugins for uploading and processing video clips."
14042800,14050240," Just like that, they made many systems as a service, absolutely crazy processing."
14050240,14051840," They'll be able to like edit them and stuff."
14051840,14053040," It's actually going to be nuts."
14053040,14056640," No, I know."
14056640,14060000," I'm trying to like make it less clear what we're doing."
14060000,14060720," Oh, I see."
14062160,14062720," Okay."
14062720,14063200," All right."
14063200,14063680," Okay."
14063680,14068800," So we're usually just just actually like extremely good at that."
14068800,14070640," Yeah, we'll we're both just really tired."
14070640,14074240," We'll it'll actually be like fine and cool."
14074240,14075360," It'll be interesting."
14075360,14076160," Yeah, like it."
14076160,14077920," Yeah, you will like it."
14077920,14078160," Yeah."
14078160,14078640," Yeah."
14078640,14080160," Yeah, like it's actually fine."
14080160,14081680," I know that might seem far."
14081680,14082080," Okay."
14082080,14084880," I thought I thought I totally misunderstood you."
14084880,14085120," Okay."
14085120,14089600," Okay."
14089600,14094000," Whale coin."
14094000,14095520," Yes."
14095520,14103280," I don't even want to joke about this stuff."
14103280,14104640," Because people are going to think it's serious."
14104640,14106400," We could make a thing called like a float buck."
14106400,14107920," A float buck."
14107920,14110240," And it's tethered to one US dollar."
14110240,14117760," If you upgrade past the OG tier, you like get the difference in float bucks every month."
14117760,14120720," But then you can use float bucks on literally nothing."
14120720,14124320," You just invented cryptocurrency."
14124320,14125280," And they're not tradable."
14125280,14126240," Oh my god."
14126240,14127760," They're not even tradable."
14127760,14129120," You just have them."
14129120,14130800," It's just a number that goes up for no reason."
14130800,14132640," You just have the biggest dragon horn."
14132640,14138320," So it's like a voluntary extra amount you can pay on top of your subscription."
14138320,14140960," And it just is a number next to your username."
14140960,14141840," Okay."
14141840,14144000," You literally just buy E-Pene."
14144880,14149840," It's entertaining to think about these like horrible evil systems."
14149840,14151200," It doesn't mean we're going to do it."
14151200,14153200," That one's actually a pretty good idea."
14153200,14154000," Oh, it's funny."
14154000,14155360," It's hilarious."
14155360,14159120," So you just it's like it's like post count on a forum."
14159120,14161760," It means absolutely nothing."
14161760,14163840," You have no actual credibility."
14163840,14164960," No indication of quality."
14164960,14165200," Yeah."
14165200,14168720," All you've demonstrated is that you post a lot."
14168720,14174000," All you've demonstrated is that you dump money into a furnace a lot."
14174000,14175360," It reminds me of the like."
14175360,14176800," Which like thank you."
14176800,14180080," The furnace the furnace is what drives this engine."
14180080,14181680," We're grateful for it."
14181680,14186480," But that number does not mean that like you're smart or capable."
14186480,14188880," Call the system number go up or something."
14188880,14190560," It's a system number go up."
14190560,14193600," Oh man."
14193600,14194640," Float Plains freaking out."
14194640,14195840," They want large E-Pene."
14195840,14198160," Luke they want it."
14198160,14199760," Give it to them."
14199760,14201040," Why?"
14201040,14203840," Because then you could have even more developers."
14203840,14205360," And even more time zones."
14205360,14207280," Developers developers developers."
14207280,14209440," Oh man."
14209440,14214080," Blackar asks Linus in your early years."
14214080,14215920," Didn't you spend a lot of time helping people on forums?"
14215920,14217040," Yeah for sure."
14217040,14220000," But my post count wasn't what made me credible."
14220000,14220400," Yeah."
14220400,14222800," Even if you had a ton of posts which I'm sure he did."
14222800,14225360," That's not the thing itself that made him credible."
14225360,14225840," That one thing."
14225840,14229280," NCIX forum actually had a particularly toxic way"
14229280,14230480," of handling post count."
14231360,14237040," On the side they had two leaderboards for all time post count."
14237040,14240160," And monthly post count."
14240160,14241120," Oh."
14241120,14245840," Yeah so there was nothing for quality."
14245840,14246720," That's a way to."
14246720,14247920," There was no upvote system."
14247920,14248960," Generate garbage."
14248960,14251440," Because people will fight for that."
14251440,14254720," And they'll fight for that by being like nice post."
14254720,14256160," Like that's it."
14256160,14257920," That was a very active forum."
14260160,14263200," I was often on the leaderboard and without doing that."
14263200,14265280," I spent a lot of time on forums."
14265280,14268080," Yeah I totally probably did have a lot of posts."
14268080,14270160," I've always been a lurker for that kind of stuff."
14270160,14270400," Yeah."
14270400,14273120," No I was big into like NCIX forum."
14273120,14275360," All right hit us."
14275360,14277360," All right this next one's from Mitchell."
14277360,14278800," Linus and Dan not Luke."
14278800,14282640," Have you ever seen the new Sonos era speakers?"
14282640,14284400," And do you think they will find their way"
14284400,14286080," into your current arc setup?"
14286080,14287680," All right I understand why he said not Luke now."
14287680,14288000," Nice."
14288000,14288640," Good looking out."
14289440,14290320," I'm on his one."
14290320,14293840," Arc setup?"
14293840,14296240," Oh oh oh oh arc sound bar."
14296240,14297520," Sorry I was thinking Intel arc."
14297520,14299280," Sonos."
14299280,14300960," Everything's called arc these days."
14300960,14303600," Are these the ones that have Bluetooth or something like that?"
14303600,14304720," What are these?"
14304720,14305360," Hold on a second."
14305360,14305760," Let me just."
14305760,14307040," That's a lot of money."
14307040,14307680," Have a quick."
14307680,14309280," Oh okay I'm sorry I'm gonna."
14309280,14311040," Yeah we were both working on it."
14311040,14315760," With next level audio that hits from every direction."
14315760,14317920," Wow that is quite the."
14317920,14318960," Wow."
14319520,14324160," Wow Dan that is quite the claim don't you think it hits from every direction."
14324160,14324880," Audio files."
14324880,14326960," You know what connected to your."
14326960,14328720," What even is this thing I don't understand."
14328720,14329760," What am I even looking at?"
14329760,14330800," It's a circle."
14330800,14331600," Hit for."
14331600,14332720," Are these two of them?"
14332720,14335520," Make the whole room the sweet spot."
14335520,14336880," That's not how that works."
14336880,14339840," Oh my goodness it's got a lot of drivers in it."
14339840,14345440," The central center tweeter fills the room with dazzling vocals."
14345440,14346320," That's how that works."
14347680,14349040," Surround sound so."
14349040,14349360," Sound wave."
14349360,14350000," Surreal."
14350000,14351840," I mean yeah probably not."
14351840,14355440," I have no intention of going surround in my arcs."
14355440,14357760," Oops sorry but hold on."
14357760,14360400," I have no intention of going surround in my arc setup."
14360400,14362080," Do you also have an arc sound bar?"
14362080,14364720," I can't remember which one I stole."
14364720,14367280," I think it's the LG one that I did the short circuit."
14367280,14371440," Oh okay yeah so let's just say as part of a you know whatever sound bar setup."
14372400,14378000," My home theater with what is it?"
14378000,14386880," 7.4.2 atmos in it is literally 20 paces from where my arc sound bar is."
14386880,14393920," If I'm in it for the cinematic experience I will go into the home theater"
14393920,14398960," and like my kids friends who are hanging out in the rec room do not need that."
14398960,14399360," So no."
14399360,14401120," That's where I'm at."
14401120,14401920," How about you Dan?"
14401920,14403520," Do you have surrounds on your sound bar?"
14403520,14405440," Yeah they're all garbage."
14405440,14410640," I wouldn't buy this because isn't Sonos the company that like moonlight's their old products"
14410640,14413200," and then you can't use them anymore because they're all like app connected."
14413200,14418960," Okay so they did have to sunset I think is the word you were looking for but it's okay it's very late."
14418960,14427520," They did have a controversy around that but they in my opinion did pretty right by the community"
14427520,14434560," in the end they had they just have two separate versions of the app S1 and S2 and the legacy"
14434560,14438560," products only work on S1 and they're not getting any new features or new updates or anything but"
14438560,14446240," they work as they did which is as it should be and they went pretty reasonably into the back"
14446240,14456560," catalog of products and built-in support in S2 and yeah I actually am fairly happy with their"
14456560,14457280," approach to that."
14457280,14461360," I don't know."
14461360,14465760," All right next what else we got here this is from Alexander."
14465760,14472880," Would the there would the there be a chance to see another launch of the Noctua XLTT edition"
14472880,14479680," fans or future coolers where the next generation of ND sorry NHG 15 comes out."
14479680,14480720," He's falling apart at the scene."
14480720,14482080," Really they're car-prehinged."
14482080,14482960," You're doing great Dan."
14484640,14490000," I don't see why not I could see future Noctua XLTT collabs but we don't have anything in the"
14490000,14491280," works right now I can tell you that much."
14491280,14492960," This is from Adam."
14492960,14498240," Hi Linus and Luke what if any would be the certification in hardware or software you wish"
14498240,14501120," you would have gotten earlier in your career."
14501120,14508560," I wish I had done um oh man what's that like Microsoft networking something one."
14508560,14511920," Oh yeah okay yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I don't remember what it's called but I wish I'd"
14511920,14515680," done that I wish I'd had a much much better understanding of networking going into this."
14515680,14521360," Yeah some networking stuff would be interesting I don't care about any of the"
14521360,14525920," certs in particular personally like I'm not like oh I wish I had a shirt."
14525920,14531600," I was gonna say when you were talking I was gonna say like please don't say CompTIA+"
14531600,14538080," we've had a we've had a video like in the back pocket for years it's been an idea for me to take"
14538080,14542800," the CompTIA+ yeah and like see if I see if I can even pass it."
14542800,14543920," You destroy it for sure."
14543920,14544640," I don't know."
14544640,14547200," Um you just have to remember a lot of very old things."
14547200,14555200," I remember like when I hadn't seen uh like IDE drive in like five to eight years I looked at"
14555200,14559920," some like current generation CompTIA documentation they're talking about IDE drive so I was like"
14559920,14561200," really?"
14561200,14566640," In fairness a lot of repairs are gonna be for all that time I was in repairs."
14566640,14567840," Like okay that's fair."
14567840,14574880," Yeah I don't know um yeah I don't care about the individual certs."
14574880,14580480," Knowing more through doing certs about I'm gonna steal your answer but networking would have been nice."
14580480,14582720," Um but yeah that's about it."
14582720,14585440," Okay uh this is from Dustin."
14585440,14590480," Linus and look if you could each make one product for the LTT store even if it would never sell what"
14590480,14597040," would it be. Oh uh the the cat teaser the like highest quality cat teaser of all time."
14597040,14603680," Give me a second."
14603680,14605040," Oh how about a CPU chiller?"
14605040,14605760," I'm computing."
14605760,14610480," Oh yeah I guess any kind it's pretty a car."
14610480,14619600," I don't know um I do really like our like high end products that is something that I'm into."
14620560,14623120," The screwdriver in particular is pretty sweet."
14623120,14625520," A case."
14625520,14626720," Really?"
14626720,14628400," It'd be kind of sick."
14628400,14628800," Okay."
14628800,14630560," I have pretty strong feelings about cases."
14630560,14636240," Someone asked me recently about one of my computer builds and I don't have as many photos"
14636240,14641680," like you do but for an actually pretty long time at this point I've got YouTube videos"
14641680,14646320," so I looked it up because I was like maybe there was a video on that and there was and in that"
14646320,14649920," video I'm talking about I'm using the case that I'm currently and I'm not necessarily because"
14649920,14654000," I'm super happy about it but because there aren't any that I'm that into right now."
14654000,14656080," So you'd want to do a that a Luke case."
14656080,14659360," Yeah I am pretty into the fractal North case."
14659360,14660880," It's really cool."
14660880,14663680," So it wouldn't be the coal bar then."
14663680,14669120," I mean come on it's the obvious joke I had to make it."
14669120,14670800," Yeah that's fair that's fair."
14670800,14676240," But no yeah there's there's probably a few tools that I'd be into but I think having a"
14676240,14679920," case designed by our team would be like really cool."
14679920,14682160," Okay."
14682160,14682960," I'd be pretty into that."
14682960,14685200," Okay."
14685200,14686960," Next up is from Cornelius."
14686960,14688320," This one looks like about me."
14688320,14691440," Yo Dan I'm someone who's getting into making."
14691440,14692320," That's cute."
14692320,14694960," Making mixing and mastering music."
14694960,14695840," What a coincidence."
14695840,14698640," Who would have curated this merch message about you?"
14698640,14700720," It wasn't me I was outside."
14703200,14709600," Single core processing speed definitely the way that DSP processing works is you can't really"
14709600,14711600," split and multi-process cores."
14711600,14716800," You can do it in some instances with VSTs and other things like that but the final audio"
14716800,14721600," chain needs to be single threaded otherwise it can't keep the samples in lockstep."
14721600,14727920," Another thing is really really good USB driving chips if you're using outboard gear."
14727920,14729920," You're going to matty PCI card it doesn't matter."
14729920,14733360," So single core speed is your big thing."
14733360,14737280," Don't be like me and buy a thread ripper because you think you're smart and then"
14737280,14742080," 48 cores ain't good enough to make music because the castle eating is too high."
14742080,14742400," Whoops."
14742400,14744720," Also have a thing to put up on screen right now."
14744720,14749040," I was going to say should we end at 11.59 just to troll them."
14749040,14752320," You have 50 seconds to make that call."
14752320,14753440," No let's go."
14753440,14754560," No we got to finish."
14754560,14754960," All right."
14754960,14757840," Next this is from Trevor."
14758400,14762160," Luke is this the same Trevor W that I see like everywhere."
14762160,14768560," Do you place multiple orders per week or they're just a bunch of Trevor W all lower case users."
14768560,14774320," I don't know because I'm starting to if I start to recognize you in the merge message queue."
14774320,14776800," You got a problem."
14776800,14779440," I hope Trevor W is coming to LTX."
14779440,14782160," I hope Trevor W introduces themselves as Trevor W."
14782160,14785200," I'll see you there in 20 seconds."
14787520,14788240," Do we wait?"
14788240,14788720," What do we do?"
14788720,14789600," Do you want me to end the stream?"
14789600,14790960," No we're doing it."
14790960,14791600," We're doing it."
14791600,14792080," 10 seconds."
14792080,14794160," I mean no no we're continuing to finish."
14794160,14795360," We have to celebrate."
14795360,14797280," Oh I see."
14797280,14797680," All right."
14797680,14798640," Sure."
14798640,14800640," We're both like we got to keep doing it."
14800640,14805840," 4, 3, 2, 1, Happy New Land Shoulder."
14805840,14808560," We did it."
14808560,14809840," Saturday Land Shoulder."
14809840,14810960," We posed for a thumbnail."
14810960,14811440," Midstream."
14811440,14814560," I'm tired."
14814560,14815680," Okay."
14816880,14818560," Luke, Linus, and Dan."
14818560,14823840," What does your go-to fast food or quick take out for when you're too busy to eat at home?"
14823840,14828560," Luke might have to answer as he would have before he was chicken and rice look."
14828560,14831360," Oh I've got chicken and rice luke for hot man."
14831360,14832080," My whole leg."
14832080,14836640," You adopted the chicken and rice."
14836640,14838960," I was born and I can't do bane but you get it."
14841280,14844480," Oh by once. Oh my twice. Oh my chicken."
14844480,14845120," Not rice."
14845120,14845760," Not with rice."
14845760,14847920," Sorry."
14847920,14848400," Sorry."
14848400,14851520," What's your go-to fast food or quick take out?"
14851520,14851760," Oh."
14851760,14854480," And W."
14854480,14856480," Chipotle or equivalent."
14856480,14860800," There's like mucho burrito locally that's kind of like chipotle but cheaper."
14860800,14863360," I've been enjoying chipotle because when you get a bowl"
14863360,14869280," like the like emergency meal that we had last night was chipotle."
14869280,14869520," Yeah."
14869520,14874240," Because when you get a bowl you can actually configure it in a pretty decently healthy way"
14874240,14874880," in my opinion."
14874880,14876960," It doesn't feel too bad."
14876960,14877200," Yeah."
14877200,14884080," Because whenever you're doing if you're succumbing to fast food it's usually like a least worst."
14884080,14885040," Yeah."
14885040,14886080," In my opinion."
14886080,14887440," If you're paying attention to that at all."
14887440,14888640," Yeah."
14888640,14889200," Yeah."
14889200,14890080," In that case."
14890080,14890400," Whatever."
14890400,14895920," Well okay to be clear if I feel like physically ill after then that's bad like I won't get McDonald's."
14895920,14896640," Yeah I can't."
14896640,14897200," I have."
14897200,14897600," Okay."
14897600,14897840," Yeah."
14897840,14899120," I know not everyone is this way."
14899120,14900240," I get that from McDonald's."
14900240,14900320," Yeah."
14900320,14901920," I feel horrible."
14901920,14905360," Well you know what it is is it's when you haven't eaten there in a while."
14905360,14905760," Yeah."
14905760,14908240," If I eat there regularly it's fine."
14908240,14909680," Like I have no problem with it."
14909680,14913440," Like I used to be that was my go to was like the McDouble and a junior chicken."
14913440,14916960," Because it was like less than four dollars for two burgers."
14916960,14917440," Yeah."
14917440,14920960," And like you never get the fries never buy the drink because that's where all the margin is."
14920960,14923920," You just get the two and you could you could ask."
14923920,14927600," I don't know if you can do it anymore but it used to be that you could add tomato"
14927600,14929520," and it actually didn't cost any extra."
14929520,14933040," Or it was like 15 cents or something like that like it was trivial."
14933040,14933120," Yeah."
14933120,14939440," So you could add stuff to them and the policy was that it was it was considered customizing"
14939440,14943840," it as opposed to something that you could pay extra for because it was off menu."
14943840,14946960," And so it was easier for them to manage it by just putting it on for you."
14946960,14951120," So I would add tomato to the junior chicken and then what would add to the Mcdell."
14951120,14955600," I can't remember but I would like add stuff and they were like pretty okay."
14955600,14958000," And when I was doing it regularly it didn't bother me."
14958000,14962640," But then I went like a few months without eating McDonald's and I went back and I just like had"
14962640,14963200," my go to it."
14963200,14965120," I just it wasn't because I'd made a conscious decision."
14965120,14969440," I just didn't and I went back and I had my go to and I was like I cannot finish this."
14969440,14969840," Oh yeah."
14969840,14972320," I cannot finish either of these let alone both of them."
14972320,14978320," I mostly feel it afterwards but yeah if I'm not caring at all it's usually Wendy's."
14978320,14979680," Oh."
14979680,14981120," But I honestly think yeah okay."
14981120,14983760," Our fast food up here is trash."
14983760,14984080," What?"
14984080,14985040," And Ellie's good."
14985040,14985280," No."
14986240,14986560," No."
14986560,14988880," Those are those are fighting words."
14988880,14989520," Yeah."
14989520,14990880," What's wrong with the team burger?"
14990880,14994160," Have you spent time in America?"
14994160,14995200," What?"
14995200,14997600," Well no American A&W is disgusting."
14997600,14999760," It's a completely different restaurant."
14999760,15000240," So no I'm not I'm not a restaurant."
15000240,15000560," Oh."
15000560,15003520," Like when I was when I was down in Arizona visiting my grandpa."
15003520,15004560," Oh sure."
15004560,15007920," The place we were staying at had no way to cook so we're eating out all the time."
15007920,15008320," Got it."
15008320,15010880," And there was a lot of work to do."
15010880,15011120," Sure."
15011120,15013680," So I wasn't a lot of time to like sit down in restaurants."
15013680,15017120," So we were getting drive through quite frequently."
15017120,15020240," And we were getting a lot of in and out specifically."
15020240,15020480," Okay."
15020480,15022800," Damn."
15022800,15027280," And I'll see Americans clown on In and out be like In and out trash."
15027280,15029600," This other insert name is so much better."
15029600,15030720," And it's like yeah okay."
15030720,15031680," But compared to our stuff."
15031680,15032080," No."
15032080,15035360," Isn't In and out the one we went to at CES that one year right after we landed?"
15035360,15038000," I think In and out's the one that I don't even like."
15038000,15038880," Oh I don't know."
15038880,15039280," I don't know."
15039280,15040160," Oh okay."
15040160,15040400," Okay."
15040400,15041520," Tell you what tell you what."
15041520,15041840," Okay."
15041840,15046560," I might be biased as well because when you walk by the windows In and out."
15046560,15049200," You can they have whole potatoes and they chop them for the fries."
15049200,15050720," And they have like five guys to set too."
15050720,15051520," Whole tomatoes and stuff."
15051520,15054080," So like I think my brain is like this is better."
15054080,15056080," Maybe."
15056080,15056640," I don't know."
15056640,15058080," I'm just saying that could be an influence."
15058080,15061920," I have to try In and out again because I think that there's one that's like"
15061920,15063760," known for being really amazing."
15063760,15066320," And I went there and I was like this is this is really not that great."
15066320,15067600," So the one with the animal style."
15067600,15068880," Like five guys is really good."
15069680,15070160," That one."
15070160,15072240," I had five guys once and it was good."
15072240,15075920," Like Vera's is good but I don't even consider five guys Vera's like in a note."
15075920,15078080," In a note if it's the place that I thought I went."
15078080,15079520," Like took a long time."
15079520,15081680," Like it wasn't that fast."
15081680,15083680," I went through drive through every time when I was on the agenda."
15083680,15083680," Okay."
15083680,15084560," So it was quick."
15084560,15089360," Well I'm gonna say yeah maybe sometime when you're going to the states."
15089360,15089600," Yeah."
15089600,15091200," Like have A&W on your."
15091200,15091760," Oh no."
15091760,15092640," Before you go to the."
15092640,15093120," Oh sure."
15093120,15093440," Get on the plane."
15093440,15093760," Oh okay."
15093760,15094080," I know."
15094080,15094960," Nice different American."
15094960,15095120," Yeah."
15095120,15095440," No no no."
15095440,15095920," It's disgusting."
15095920,15098080," Have A&W here and then like when you land."
15098080,15098400," Sure."
15098400,15099200," Go in and out."
15099200,15099840," All right."
15099840,15100640," They're like close to each other."
15100640,15101200," All right."
15101200,15104000," Okay more."
15104000,15105600," AJ."
15105600,15106320," Always more."
15106320,15110000," You guys often joke about Colton being fired."
15110000,15110320," Yeah."
15110320,15114880," And I know that started when he got LTT to copyright strikes in a row."
15114880,15115200," Yeah."
15115200,15117200," Can you say what actually got those videos?"
15117200,15117200," Oh."
15117200,15117760," Striked."
15117760,15118880," Oh I replied to this."
15118880,15120160," I didn't."
15120160,15120720," Colton did."
15120720,15121200," Curate this."
15121200,15122240," Yeah he he he."
15122240,15122640," He strike."
15122640,15129040," He literally pressed the button to to claim like a copyright takedown against our own"
15129040,15129440," channel."
15129440,15129680," Yeah."
15129680,15132800," That's nice."
15132800,15137200," When we say he copyright strike the channel we there's no extra steps."
15137200,15137600," There's just."
15137600,15140240," Do do do do do do strike."
15140240,15148480," How many OG tier subscribers are still on floor plane and how do you think you can"
15148480,15151680," incentivize them to move on to a profitable plan?"
15151680,15152960," I curated this one."
15152960,15153600," Come on."
15153600,15154080," Let's go."
15154080,15155040," How do I incentivize?"
15155040,15155760," Yeah."
15155760,15157680," We just make the plans sick."
15158240,15159840," There's a lot of OG subscribers still."
15159840,15164560," I don't know off the top of my head but the the idea is we just have to make it worth"
15164560,15170000," upgrading and one of the ways that we shot ourselves in the foot is the video and audio"
15170000,15172400," quality on the OG tier is like pretty darn good."
15172400,15173840," So."
15173840,15176240," Especially with that new Nvidia upscaling thing."
15176240,15176880," Yep."
15176880,15178160," Yeah it looks great."
15178160,15180240," Yeah when you guys launched that video I was like."
15180240,15183440," Look okay my thing."
15183440,15184000," No it's good."
15184000,15186000," Whether I'm invested in framework."
15186000,15186560," You have to."
15186560,15191840," Whether I have a video streaming platform or whatever it is or whether I make my money"
15191840,15193440," through online ads."
15193440,15197600," Okay well fine I'm still going to talk about other brands of laptops."
15197600,15201680," I'm still going to talk about the benefits of paying less money to a streaming service"
15201680,15203600," and I'm still going to talk about Pihle."
15203600,15203920," Yeah."
15203920,15204640," That's my job."
15204640,15211040," You know like I completely support and would would fight for your right whatever blah blah blah."
15211040,15214720," I just the like business part of my brain the second I saw that video was like."
15214720,15220000," Yeah but you know what that business part of your brain you don't listen to it anyway."
15220000,15220800," That's probably true."
15220800,15225200," And and if your business part of your brain agreed all the time with what I was doing I"
15225200,15226160," don't think you'd work here."
15226160,15228640," Yeah."
15228640,15230400," Probably not."
15230400,15234720," Oh there's no incoming."
15234720,15236320," Holy we did it."
15236320,15237360," Oh my god."
15237360,15239360," This next one's from Tyler."
15239360,15241520," Somebody else is making them about me tonight."
15241520,15242640," Hello Dan."
15242640,15246800," What is an audio engineering tip you wish you knew during your novice phase."
15246800,15250480," Also known as constantly and forever."
15250480,15256640," I would probably say I've molt this one over for a bit now."
15256640,15265280," You're not learning how to mix or make good audio."
15265280,15269600," You know from the mechanical standpoint of like which knob do I turn."
15269600,15272800," And how do I make this waveform look properly."
15272800,15281280," What you're doing is developing an intuition on kind of how it's sounding now"
15281280,15285520," and where I can massage it into where it needs to be."
15285520,15286400," Right."
15286400,15290960," It's kind of it's more like I tried to explain this to somebody else the other day."
15292960,15298080," Audio is not like drawing it's more like clay sculpture."
15298080,15304480," You don't start with your sketch and then your outline that sort of thing right."
15304480,15310320," You have this lump and you push it and squish it until it's done and you never really know when"
15310320,15317840," it's done and so everything you're doing is based on that intuition and whoever's intuition"
15317840,15321200," is doing your mixing or your audio or anything like that."
15321760,15326640," It's all kind of that's where your signature sound is and that's kind of where your"
15326640,15331520," your skill is is just that intuition and that's constantly evolving."
15331520,15338080," And so the other thing I wish I knew is that you're an office forever."
15338080,15340400," That's that's it. You don't you don't get good."
15340400,15344800," Nice. I love how it's called mastering when actually everybody's anonymous."
15344800,15346160," Okay well."
15347280,15351360," Just here's a here's a here's a minute. Where's the bell Dan?"
15351360,15356960," There's a 45 minute rant on the history of the term master."
15356960,15358240," Whatever."
15358240,15361200," That's my that's my thing."
15361200,15363040," All right. Oh, there's another merch message."
15363040,15367840," Do you guys like my sir they've just hit the second channel meme."
15367840,15371120," I was surprised by how many upvotes it got on the subreddit."
15371120,15372960," I hope it brought you some joy during the stress."
15372960,15373680," Yes. Yeah."
15373680,15375120," It was good."
15375120,15375520," It was good."
15375520,15376160," The memes were good."
15376160,15376880," Let's get through them."
15376880,15377440," They're coming in."
15377440,15378240," They're still coming in."
15378240,15380640," So we need to get through these before people can keep buying things."
15380640,15381360," Hi, Lemison Luke."
15381360,15384800," I'm currently working as an advanced repair agent at Geek Squad and I was wondering"
15384800,15390000," how do you feel about the Geek Squad as a whole like to call us diet IT consultants."
15390000,15395360," Um, we've also had in our back pocket the idea of secret shopping Geek Squad like forever."
15395360,15396960," We just keep not getting around to it."
15396960,15399360," I don't know because I haven't used Geek Squad ever."
15399360,15400320," So I want to try it."
15400320,15401440," Basically."
15402000,15406240," I wish the agents had more autonomy to be able to do more things."
15406240,15413040," Um, I departed there right when they started doing the like you take a client computer,"
15413040,15417360," you put it in the back, you plug in an ethernet cable and a remote team fixes it."
15417360,15420080," And that was that disgusted me."
15420080,15423200," I liked it when we could fix things ourselves."
15423200,15426320," So it needs a hard drive replacement ship it off so someone else can do it."
15426320,15429120," It's like I can replace a hard drive in a laptop, bro."
15429120,15430560," Like let me do it."
15430560,15430720," Yeah."
15430720,15431040," Um."
15431920,15432400," I don't know."
15432400,15435440," I liked the old days when Geek Squad was not a part of Best Buy."
15435440,15441440," Like they it was in Best Buy, but it was its own company that operated physically within Best Buy."
15441440,15442800," I liked that a lot more."
15442800,15446560," Once it was purchased by Best Buy, I worked there then and then I had to leave."
15446560,15449840," I don't remember why I went to university or something."
15449840,15453120," Then I worked there again afterwards once it was part of Best Buy and it was worse."
15453120,15456320," And it was significantly getting worse as my exit happened."
15456320,15457120," So I don't know."
15457120,15458240," Okay."
15458240,15459360," Next up is from Eric."
15459360,15461840," Hey Linus, you're into data preservation."
15461840,15466560," With libraries and internet archive under attack, have you given any thought to your role?"
15466560,15471440," Data preservation, non-profit, internet archive mirror, Linus library?"
15471440,15473760," Yeah, big part of the reason that we haven't really done,"
15473760,15478560," as much as I would like to, is just focus."
15478560,15482720," I'm going to just make a little memo for myself."
15482720,15485440," We just hired a community manager."
15485440,15489440," And I would love for part of this individual's role."
15489440,15490960," So they're going to work on the social team."
15490960,15495760," But I'd love for part of this person's role to be to really engage with some of the initiatives"
15495760,15503280," that have kind of been left alone by us and not really driven by us, just like they're active."
15503280,15505840," Like the folding team on the forum, for example, it's there."
15505840,15508160," But we don't really do much with it."
15508160,15509520," And I'd like to see us do more."
15509520,15519680," So like folding events to fundraise for data preservation, etc."
15519680,15521200," Yeah."
15521200,15526640," This one, this one got, I probably shown to the screen and that makes sense."
15526640,15529440," But someone, someone messaged in and said, \"Go to bed."
15529440,15531120," Luke has been streaming for half the night.\""
15531120,15534240," Very funny."
15534240,15536960," That is very funny actually."
15536960,15539840," But I think we owe you something in return."
15539840,15540640," Dan?"
15540640,15544560," I missed."
15544560,15550080," Wow. Another thing I fail at."
15550080,15551680," There you go."
15551680,15552640," I was thinking about it."
15552640,15553360," I was thinking about it."
15553360,15556000," That's all the way over there."
15556000,15558160," This one is not a question, so I'm going to skip it."
15558160,15561520," Wait, did you create that?"
15561520,15561840," No."
15561840,15562560," Who curated that?"
15562560,15563360," I didn't create that."
15563360,15564320," Who curated that crap?"
15564880,15567520," Oh, we need to, we need art history on this."
15567520,15568480," You've been called out."
15568480,15569760," This is from Timothy."
15569760,15570880," Hopefully this sneaks in."
15570880,15574800," At Dan, rooting for your remaster of the Christmas album."
15574800,15576640," Hopefully Linus doesn't notice this."
15576640,15577120," I'm Kia--"
15577120,15578000," Archived."
15578000,15578640," Archived."
15578640,15580240," Archived."
15580240,15582240," Okay, next up, from Luca."
15582240,15583440," Good evening Linus."
15583440,15586720," What do you think about UB Keys as part of your IT security concept?"
15586720,15589440," Would definitely be a good video topic as well."
15589440,15593840," They're a good idea, but any security factor that is so inconvenient"
15593840,15597360," that people will find a way to work around it is not a good security factor."
15597360,15599920," So the earlier UB Keys that we had--"
15599920,15603600," We found UB Keys for like eight years."
15603600,15607760," Faded out of use because they came out around the time that laptops"
15607760,15611600," started going USB-C only and iPhones didn't really support NFC."
15611600,15616320," And so there was like 30% of my devices, for example, didn't work with it."
15616320,15618000," And so I would have to like run to another device."
15618000,15619520," Like I don't have time for that."
15619520,15623360," So I switched over to Google Authenticator at that time."
15623360,15626400," I would love to reimplement physical security factors."
15626400,15628720," I think that they're a really excellent idea,"
15628720,15632960," but they're not necessarily the best for every individual in every role."
15632960,15634720," So we just got to figure out--"
15634720,15636240," And by we, I mean, Luc--"
15636240,15638320," Figure out what our plan looks like."
15638320,15642560," And if this is part of it, then yeah, I'm back on board because I do think they're great."
15642560,15646080," Okay, and our last one from the night."
15646080,15650160," Can we get any details on the PDF?"
15650160,15654400," I know a lot of security researchers would be interested in analyzing it."
15654400,15656080," And the PDF viewer."
15656080,15657280," It is not a PDF."
15657280,15662160," It was just called .pdf.something."
15662160,15667280," I highly encourage you to check out the Theo Joe video that was referenced in the video"
15667280,15668080," that Linus hosted."
15668080,15670080," It's very good."
15670080,15673680," And he talks about the attack vector and how to identify it."
15673680,15676640," And the complications with identifying it."
15676640,15679040," There was another question at some other point."
15679040,15680320," Oh, no, it was this one."
15680320,15682000," Yeah, it wasn't a PDF, right?"
15682000,15683360," It was a .scr."
15683360,15687920," It was a screensaver file, but it runs with similar permissions levels of an executable"
15687920,15689920," so you can recap it on computers."
15689920,15692160," There's also like .com."
15692160,15695120," And I'm pretty sure it was Theo Joe mentioned this."
15695120,15697200," I haven't actually watched that video in a while."
15697200,15698720," But he mentioned--"
15698720,15699600," Do you have the comments, though?"
15704080,15710960," He commented about how based on how you word the title, you could make it so that like"
15710960,15718160," so-and-so company brand integration for Linus Tech Tips featured on youtube.com."
15718160,15721360," And it's a .com file."
15721360,15725840," But it looks like you just don't have file extensions on and they did youtube.com."
15725840,15726400," Right."
15726400,15728320," So like there's a bunch of them."
15728320,15732160," And yeah, try to educate yourself if you can."
15732160,15733040," Watch that video. It's good."
15733040,15734880," And that's it."
