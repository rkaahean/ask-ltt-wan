0,7000," We have got a great when show lined up for you guys."
7000,8000," Welcome everyone."
8000,10000," How do I know it's going to be great?"
10000,14000," Because it's the when show and it's great every time."
14000,16000," And Luke is going to help me."
16000,19000," He's going to help me make it great today."
19000,24720," Our main topics are we had a power outage last week and when we stitched together the clips"
24720,26120," of the when show."
26120,30120," Our main topic was cut by accident."
30120,34560," There are conspiracy theories that Microsoft found out we were going to talk about Windows"
34560,39120," Modern standby and cut the power and deleted the vaud."
39120,43960," Actually it was just a miscommunication with the clips that had to be salvaged from one"
43960,46200," place and another place and put back together."
46200,50560," Anyway the point is we're going to rehash that real quick styles for you guys."
50560,56560," We're also going to be talking about the big controversy this week."
56560,58440," Oh, Poppyzilla versus Logan Paul?"
58440,61200," There's been a number of big controversies this week."
61200,63560," This seems like the internet lately to be honest."
63560,67680," Lately you're like competing to see who can be that week's major news."
67680,68680," Not even that month."
68680,70000," Coffeezilla Alleges."
70000,72800," Logan Paul's crypto zoo is a scam."
72800,73800," Bomp, bomp, bomp."
73800,75960," And NFTs were a scam."
75960,80880," And Logan Paul is not the only creator that Coffeezilla has exposed recently."
80880,83440," My only question is, am I next?"
83440,85160," Coffeezilla."
85160,86520," What dirt you got on me?"
86520,87920," I'm genuinely curious."
87920,89440," We haven't sold NFTs."
89440,91160," What else you got helps a lot."
91160,93920," We also have a crypto coin."
93920,96640," That also helps a lot."
96640,97840," Let's see."
97840,99760," I don't know."
99760,101360," I kind of want to talk about this."
101360,105920," Filmora pulling lifetime licenses."
105920,108920," Not a good look."
108920,110680," Not a good look at all."
110680,112040," Also graphics card leaks."
112040,113040," Those are fun."
113040,114040," People like those, right?"
114040,117400," 4070 Ti, maybe leaked?"
117400,119480," Somebody will find it interesting."
119480,120480," Not him."
120480,126960," I mean, don't you think 110 degrees on the 7900 XTX being in spec is interesting?"
126960,130080," Yeah, I'm also not surprised though."
130080,132040," Yeah, that's fair."
132040,133040," Yeah."
133040,134040," All right."
134040,154320," Thank you."
154320,161400," The show is brought to you today by SeaSonic, Manscaped, and Squarespace so you can power"
161400,165080," up your grooming tools and make a website about it."
165080,167720," Yeah, maybe don't make that website."
167720,168720," All right."
168720,171920," Why don't we jump right into our first topic for the day?"
171920,172920," Is it Windows?"
172920,173920," Is it Modern Standby?"
173920,174920," It's Modern Standby."
174920,175920," We're doing it again."
175920,176920," Let's talk about it."
176920,177920," Yeah."
177920,182160," Our little video about Windows Modern Standby really lit some fires internally over at Microsoft."
182160,187760," And Alex was able to have a chat with the VP of Windows platform and services to go over"
187760,189480," some questions."
189480,190840," Question number one."
190840,197120," Why the heck is S3 sleep, which seemed to work pretty good, being removed from the"
197120,198800," biases of laptops?"
198800,203360," And the answer is Microsoft is moving away from S3 sleep because how each device goes"
203360,206600," to sleep is controlled by that device's firmware."
206600,211280," That means for a device to sleep properly, the firmware needs to be maintained by the"
211280,212840," company that made said device."
212840,217640," And I don't know about you, Luke, but sleep has worked perfectly on every computer I've"
217640,219080," ever owned."
219080,226760," I genuinely don't believe I have ever actually had a computer where sleep consistently worked."
226760,227760," Ever."
227760,228760," I don't think I have."
228760,230440," You haven't actually owned that many computers."
230440,231440," No, that's true."
231440,232440," Yeah."
232440,233440," That's valid, true and fair."
233440,235360," But you've owned two laptops ever."
235360,236360," No."
236360,237360," You're a snooze."
237360,239160," I'm on my fourth."
239160,240160," Really?"
240160,241920," What do you run for a laptop now?"
241920,243880," I got a pretty cool one, actually."
243880,244880," Did you steal it from work?"
244880,245880," I did."
245880,246880," You told me to, to be fair."
246880,248640," You literally told me to on a show."
248640,250280," There is footage proof of this."
250280,252520," You threw laptops at me."
252520,253520," I did do that."
253520,254520," You did."
254520,255520," What are you running now?"
255520,256520," What did you take?"
256520,257520," I didn't."
257520,258520," What do you have?"
258520,259520," I didn't."
259520,260520," I didn't actually."
260520,261520," And did you use it to cheat in the art challenge?"
261520,262520," No."
262520,263520," No."
263520,264520," I genuinely didn't."
264520,265520," Okay, what is it?"
265520,266760," I actually don't even remember."
266760,268800," It's in a SUS laptop."
268800,269800," It's a nice one."
269800,270800," I don't remember the model."
270800,271800," I didn't ask."
271800,273320," Like I just asked for a laptop."
273320,275280," That was it."
275280,277280," And I got handed like a very nice one."
277280,278280," Okay."
278280,280520," It's like when you turn it on, it goes like, phew."
280520,281520," Okay."
281520,282520," I know that much."
282520,283520," All right."
283520,284520," Yeah, it does that."
284520,290480," By using S0 sleep instead of S3 sleep, Microsoft gets more control over sleep instead of the"
290480,295160," device manufacturer and has a much higher success rate for everything going to sleep"
295160,298400," and waking up properly using S0 sleep."
298400,301440," Also apparently helps with security since Windows is in control of the device at all"
301440,302440," times."
302440,304000," Okay."
304000,307480," Our next question is, well, you know, that's a problem."
307480,310320," Obviously still because it's not working properly still."
310320,313200," So what is being done?"
313200,317880," As we anticipated, figuring out what's going wrong with Windows modern standby is very"
317880,324960," difficult since many of the bugs are what they called hyzen bugs, aka if you observe"
324960,329040," the bugs, their behavior actually changes."
329040,334480," A lot of telemetry is turned off during sleep to reduce power consumption, obviously."
334480,340960," But this also means that if you turn on said telemetry to try to diagnose a problem with"
340960,344920," sleep, well, the test you're running is no longer the same because now you've got a"
344920,346880," bunch of telemetry running."
346880,350520," They've looked into the situation that we described where a laptop doesn't properly go"
350520,355240," into disconnected sleep when you unplug it while it is sleeping."
355240,358040," On some devices, it looks like we actually got it right."
358040,362280," That does seem to be a problem and they're looking into a fix."
362280,369160," But they said it is only one of many potential ways that modern standby can cause problems."
369160,376040," Basically, if we want this issue to go away, Microsoft needs a whack ton of data."
376040,377280," All right, then."
377280,382400," I will say one thing before you go there, I will say the hyzen bugs thing."
382400,383400," Yes."
383400,388400," I think most people when they hear that aren't going to think like if you change some bad."
388400,389400," Yeah."
389400,390400," Yeah."
390400,391400," Totally."
391400,392960," Anyways, it doesn't matter."
392960,394840," Our chairs are at really different heights."
394840,395840," I need to."
395840,398840," Ah, that's what happened."
398840,403440," Yeah, that's not real."
403440,409720," Anyway, so what should you do when modern standby problems happen to someone within"
409720,410720," minus media group?"
410720,417360," We've been given a direct line to report these bugs, which is great for us to help get them"
417360,418360," data."
418360,422440," We can probably imagine not everyone is going to be able to do that."
422440,423440," Well, okay."
423440,424440," So first the process for us."
424440,429680," When we find a laptop hot and dead, we can go into command prompt as an admin and type"
429680,432960," in power C. This is going to be CFG."
432960,434280," That's going to be a typo."
434280,438200," Power config space slash sleep study."
438200,443520," This makes a zip file with all the battery data from our computer for the last while."
443520,445960," The notes here say maybe do this on your laptop now to demonstrate."
445960,447040," I did it last week."
447040,449600," The float plane version of the vaud, I think actually does have it."
449600,450600," I think so."
450600,451600," I think so."
451600,452600," So I'm not going to bother doing it again."
452600,454080," The point is it makes a little zip file."
454080,457240," We are then able to forward this log directly to Microsoft so they can hopefully figure"
457240,458400," out what's going on."
458400,463680," Unfortunately, not everyone gets a direct line to Microsoft, but by reporting bugs, we can"
463680,466160," hopefully get them more data to figure things out."
466160,467840," And these are the steps."
467840,472800," The feedback hub is the best way to provide detailed feedback on issues to the Windows"
472800,473800," engineering team."
473800,474800," Don't really show it."
474800,475800," Yeah."
475800,476800," Yeah, sure."
476800,483920," So detailed logs and can run additional diagnostics to help them fix issues."
483920,488840," Feedback hub can be opened up in Windows and you just need to give yourself a relevant"
488840,489840," title."
489840,493840," Like say, for example, that my computer battery is draining while it is asleep."
493840,497320," Click report a problem, then provide more information on the specific issue."
497320,501080," We've got an example kind of filled out for you, but the more details you can provide"
501080,502360," the better."
502360,503720," What was happening before?"
503720,505640," What was happening after?"
505640,508320," Click next, choose power and battery and sleep."
508320,512480," It might actually automatically select this based on what you provided in the description."
512480,518760," And make sure, though, that you get the right dropdown selected here."
518760,522120," This way it will actually end up with the appropriate engineering team."
522120,526640," It will also help to gather relevant telemetry from your system."
526640,528200," Next new feedback."
528200,532280," And then on the add more detail section, mark as high severity if you've hit the battery"
532280,533280," drain issue."
533280,535880," So, you can clearly a major focus for them."
535880,538960," Then for items below, I'd pick inability to use my PC."
538960,539960," I mean, your battery is dead."
539960,543280," So like, come on, let's go."
543280,547240," In section four, this is the most critical part, gathering additional data."
547240,550520," Without this, they will not have enough data to diagnose the issue."
550520,555760," So for the battery drain issues, select sleep, click start recording, then wait 10 seconds"
555760,557920," or so and press stop."
557920,560640," You don't need to go through the actual sleep process, nor do you need the screenshots"
560640,564240," that may take a minute or two after stopping the recording, by the way."
564240,567240," You can also put your computer to sleep during the process, then reawaken it."
567240,570440," It will collect data across this process."
570440,571880," Then click submit."
571880,576280," There's also a forum post, which maybe Luke will open here, that will show you guys how"
576280,580760," to go over these steps if you didn't manage to catch everything that we just said just"
580760,581760," now."
581760,584840," Thank you very much, Alex, for creating that."
584840,586440," So that's it guys."
586440,592240," The only way for us to solve this problem is to work together, get Microsoft as much data"
592240,596080," as we can about the problem because in their defense."
596080,600280," And I think I often give Microsoft a pretty hard time."
600280,608720," They're a multi many billions of dollars company and sometimes they have problems that I just"
608720,611240," that feel just utterly inexcusable."
611240,615920," Like any of their multiplayer gaming stuff, basically at all on PC."
615920,619320," The default search within Windows Start menu."
619320,623720," How that is so bad in this day and age."
623720,625200," It just it boggles the mind."
625200,627560," I give them a pretty hard time."
627560,636400," But in their defense, in defense of our corporate overlords, please don't cut the power to the"
636400,638760," WAN show."
638760,646120," It really is a huge challenge supporting such a wide variety of different configurations."
646120,650240," And on the PC, it is functionally infinite, right?"
650240,654640," Like even on Android, you guys, I think, struggle a fair bit on the float plane app compared"
654640,655640," to iOS."
655640,656640," Is that fair to say?"
656640,661200," Yeah, because there's so many devices and you try to change something and it like, okay,"
661200,663960," this like API version will cut off this many devices."
663960,668720," If you try to use it, whatever blah, blah, like it's it can be pretty annoying."
668720,675800," And sleep is, as we mentioned earlier, a very tough problem to diagnose."
675800,677280," Yes."
677280,685120," On Android, it's a fraction of what you deal with on the Windows PC side of things within"
685120,688440," a single generation of devices."
688440,692640," You've got your Intel, you've got your AMD, you've got all your different tiers of all"
692640,693960," the different SKUs from both of them."
693960,697360," Oh, don't forget, there's desktop and mobile, right?"
697360,700480," And then, oh, well, I mean, there's not just one motherboard."
700480,706040," No, no, no, you've got dozens upon dozens of motherboard options for everyone of those"
706040,708680," chips, all with slightly different firmware."
708680,713680," Oh, and don't forget that you might plug any number of random what you plugged a tape"
713680,714680," drive in."
714680,716800," Who plugs in a tape drive?"
716800,717800," Right?"
717800,721480," Like that's the kind of thing they're dealing with and all these different devices, many"
721480,726640," of which are engineered by very, very small teams, surprisingly small teams, like, like"
726640,732560," some, some, okay, I just became aware yesterday of a sound card, okay?"
732560,740560," A sound card from way back in the early 2000s that you need if you want to build a DIY first"
740560,744680," gen Xbox dev kit."
744680,750040," And they're in short supply because I guess people build first gen Xbox dev kits, like"
750040,751800," for fun."
751800,758880," So so an enterprising member of the community actually created a blueprint for this sound"
758880,766200," card that you can send to some, like, PCB, yeah, small run, PCB manufacturer overseas,"
766200,770360," and they'll whip it up for you for about 50 bucks and send it back and then, okay, so"
770360,776600," let's say you get a PCI e to PCI adapter and you put one of those damn things in your system."
776600,779360," Who knows how that goes to sleep?"
779360,784120," So it is legitimately a difficult problem for real."
784120,787600," Hopefully this helps."
787600,790000," And that's all I have to say about that."
790000,792120," Why don't we move on to the coffee zilla news?"
792120,798080," Can I just say I only recently became aware of coffee zilla's channel?"
798080,801360," And I feel like I've really been missing out because it's awesome."
801360,802360," Me too."
802360,805520," I haven't had enough time to watch full length, but like juicy."
805520,806520," Yeah."
806520,811440," This isn't actually it's one of those funny things where, you know, just serendipity"
811440,819200," strikes sometimes and I became aware, a new of coffee zilla twice this week."
819200,821560," Like I'd never become aware."
821560,833280," And then twice they landed in my in my inbox or in my, it was actually a document that I"
833280,838720," was reading kind of like a, like a, like a marketing, like a marketing guide document"
838720,842600," that I was looking at trying to figure out how to market better on LTT store."
842600,850080," And it was written for me specifically and had like a kind of a tone to it."
850080,851560," Something something something don't do this."
851560,853120," You don't want to end up on coffee zilla."
853120,856480," And I was like, okay, I would have never done that in the first place, but be what the"
856480,858360," crap is coffee zilla."
858360,863520," And then it ended up in my inbox because of the crypto zoo issue."
863520,870840," Now I want to say first of all, that it kind of could have been us."
870840,871840," Remember Linus coin?"
871840,873360," Yeah, we never did it."
873360,874360," No."
874360,875360," Okay."
875360,878080," So a, we never actually built a crypto token."
878080,880760," It's amazing how much people wanted us to make one."
880760,881760," And B."
881760,885520," What are we going to call it at the end of the day?"
885520,891720," I'm going to be like, yeah, we're going to be like, we're going to have to be like, we've,"
891720,897440," we're going to be like, we're going to be like, we're going to be like, we're going to"
897440,903400," be like, we're going to be like, we're going to be like, we're going to be like, we're going"
903400,905760," to be like, we're going to be like, we're going to be like, this is the only way we're"
905760,906760," going to do this."
906760,909360," If we, if we just openly tell everyone, we're scamming them."
909360,915360," Like this is a way to donate."
915360,920800," And if you guys ultimately go for it, then hey, we were all on the same page here."
920800,923960," So that, that was never going to happen."
923960,930200," But I'm really glad that even if we had approached it that way, like L.O.L. we're scamming you."
930200,936600," I'm glad we didn't because men, the way that sentiment has changed from L.O.L. meme coins."
936600,942640," Yeah, it's all a big rip off to, oh my gosh, I can't believe that this collapsed and my"
942640,944120," life savings are gone."
944120,947280," It feels like it happened really fast, hey?"
947280,950240," Yeah, definitely."
950240,955760," And I, one of the reasons why we ended up not doing the whole rug poll coin thing, rug"
955760,961680," poll coin was because we didn't trust people to take us seriously that it was a scam."
961680,965720," I don't even remember all the, we had multiple conversations around this."
965720,966720," Yeah."
966720,972960," Because it's like honestly, if you want to get rich quick, it really does seem like the"
972960,974120," winning move."
974120,975120," Just scamming people?"
975120,976120," Yeah."
976120,977120," Yeah."
977120,979600," I mean, how much more money would I have if I just scammed people?"
979600,980600," Probably a lot."
980600,982600," Like took like all the gambling sponsorships."
982600,984520," But then coffee is going to come for you."
984520,985920," Where you're getting paid to."
985920,986920," Okay."
986920,987920," So, so what all is there?"
987920,988920," Okay."
988920,990040," Like gambling seems like a really good one."
990040,994000," By the way, we, we do not accept any gambling sponsorships."
994000,995480," Gambling sponsors, forget about it."
995480,996480," Yeah."
996480,997480," But like gambling sponsorships."
997480,1000040," So you had, you had what's his nuts?"
1000040,1001040," Train wrecks."
1001040,1004040," No, no, no, no, no, no old school."
1004040,1006680," That guy that had the razor sponsorship for the longest time."
1006680,1007680," Razor sponsors."
1007680,1008680," Yeah."
1008680,1009680," Yeah."
1009680,1010680," Yeah."
1010680,1011680," Yeah."
1011680,1012680," Yeah."
1012680,1013680," Yeah."
1013680,1014680," Yeah."
1014680,1015680," Where he owned the, the like, like CSGO betting site or whatever."
1015680,1016680," Oh, I'm not going to remember the name, but there was two of them, wasn't there?"
1016680,1017680," Yeah."
1017680,1018680," Yeah."
1018680,1019680," Yeah."
1019680,1020680," There was two guys."
1020680,1021680," The two different CSGO like skin gambling sites or whatever."
1021680,1022680," Yeah."
1022680,1023680," Yeah."
1023680,1024680," Yeah."
1024680,1030640," So gambling on a site and like winning, but actually that site is giving you money to lose"
1030640,1031640," on the site."
1031640,1032840," That's a really popular one."
1032840,1033840," Yeah."
1033840,1034840," Yeah."
1034840,1035840," I syndicate, syndicate."
1035840,1036840," That's the one."
1036840,1037840," That's the one."
1037840,1038840," Yeah."
1038840,1044800," That was, I can't believe the like tiny little wrist slap that those guys got off with like"
1044800,1046840," holy smokes."
1046840,1050840," Um, what, what, what are, what are some of the other, what are some of the other good"
1050840,1051840," games?"
1051840,1056320," What kind of site you actually own and then gambling on a site where you're being paid"
1056320,1057320," and oh, right."
1057320,1060600," And the odds are tilted in your favor to make it seem like you're going to win because you're"
1060600,1062520," being paid by the site."
1062520,1065560," That's, uh, yeah, that seems to be two of the really popular ones."
1065560,1067880," And then of course there's the whole NFT one."
1067880,1073840," So why don't we, why don't we get into what exactly it is that happened with crypto zoo?"
1073840,1079160," We'll, we'll talk a little bit about, um, you know, our take on this, but this is not"
1079160,1083480," a substitute for going and watching the coffees of the video because it is excellent."
1083480,1086280," Uh, the one that I actually, I haven't, I haven't watched this one."
1086280,1087640," I'm assuming it's excellent."
1087640,1094760," The one that I watched recently was on, um, uh, hold on."
1094760,1099920," When it was drawn to my attention, do, do, do, do, do, do, I really, really enjoyed it"
1099920,1100920," though."
1100920,1103200," It was super awesome."
1103200,1106560," Youtuber accidentally exposes the scam he's promoting."
1106560,1107560," I show speed."
1107560,1108560," Yeah."
1108560,1110160," So it's a really good video, really good video."
1110160,1111240," Don't take my word for it."
1111240,1114400," Take the word of the 6.1 million people who watched it already."
1114400,1115400," Great channel."
1115400,1118320," Anyway, the point is Luke, do you want to give us the run down here?"
1118320,1119320," Uh, sure."
1119320,1121600," Crypto zoo is an NFT based game."
1121600,1122600," Nice."
1122600,1124400," Sort of sounds legit."
1124400,1126040," We'll get into that in a second."
1126040,1127040," Yeah."
1127040,1128880," Crypto zoo, where players can earn passive income."
1128880,1129880," Totally."
1129880,1130880," Makes sense."
1130880,1131880," Definitely."
1131880,1135160," Uh, it was initiated and heavily promoted by Logan Paul in quotes."
1135160,1137440," It's a really fun game that earns you money."
1137440,1138440," Wouldn't that be great?"
1138440,1139440," Uh, the player purchases."
1139440,1140440," Can I play it now?"
1140440,1141440," No."
1141440,1142440," No."
1142440,1144240," The player purchases zoo token."
1144240,1147320," They use zoo to purchase eggs of animals."
1147320,1152680," These eggs can be bred and interesting and minted to create unique NFTs."
1152680,1156840," The hatched animals should be some sort of cross between the two."
1156840,1161080," The unique hatched animals would then accrue value."
1161080,1162960," This is not new and has basically been done before."
1162960,1163960," There's crypto kitties."
1163960,1166000," I think people in the space have heard of crypto kitties."
1166000,1167960," It was a fairly major project."
1167960,1170520," New token launched in July 2021."
1170520,1175000," At the time of launch, $2.5 million worth of eggs had been sold."
1175000,1178920," Crypto zoo was supposed to come out in September of that year."
1178920,1180480," Cough, cough, star citizen."
1180480,1185440," Uh, Val, value plummeted by October rose a bit in November and then crash again in May."
1185440,1188080," Uh, as, as crypto things tend to do."
1188080,1193040," The crypto zoo website says that it was undergoing upgrades to the core infrastructure of the"
1193040,1194040," ecosystem."
1194040,1197040," That's the biggest among the main."
1197040,1198040," Big statement."
1198040,1200240," Biggest load of jargon I've ever heard."
1200240,1201240," That's so good."
1201240,1204120," I'm taking that for sure."
1204120,1205120," Why isn't this happening?"
1205120,1209080," Uh, it's just tough, you know, we're, we're undergoing updates to the core infrastructure"
1209080,1210280," of the ecosystem."
1210280,1211280," Yeah, sorry."
1211280,1215480," We, we'd love to get back to you, but, uh, we're, our team is busy upgrading, uh, core"
1215480,1221360," aspects of the ecosystem, uh, infrastructure, um, but plug."
1221360,1223160," How are you?"
1223160,1224160," Will Whedon."
1224160,1229160," Uh, uh, okay."
1229160,1235440," It's the, it's the even fin, fin, fin, Dyson, fin, Dyson."
1235440,1236440," I'm so sorry."
1236440,1237440," I guarantee you that's wrong."
1237440,1238440," I apologize."
1238440,1243000," Uh, AKA coffee Zilla has uploaded several videos criticizing Logan Paul's crypto zoo."
1243000,1247160," He has done similar videos uncovering scams and frauds over the past few years."
1247160,1250440," Uh, these often relate to crypto and NFTs."
1250440,1251640," I'm so surprised."
1251640,1253080," Uh, the criticism."
1253080,1257320," The NFTs initially released were photos that can be easily found on the internet and then"
1257320,1262320," edited just like every NFT, um, well, of, of that type."
1262320,1265240," I know there's a, it's a technology that can be used for other."
1265240,1266240," Yeah, sure."
1266240,1270360," Um, the eggs couldn't be hatched bit of an issue when that's the core functionality of"
1270360,1271360," the game."
1271360,1273080," Players couldn't get their money back."
1273080,1278200," I'm not surprised, but, you know, it is a thing and basically nothing works and the site"
1278200,1280600," never fully launched."
1280600,1281600," Big yikes."
1281600,1284760," Logan has blamed the main developer of the project."
1284760,1290760," He said he got involved with the wrong people, uh, made mistakes and missteps and then that"
1290760,1293640," there is a new team working on the project now."
1293640,1299760," The dev later said that Logan hired a team then failed to pay them bit of an issue."
1299760,1305320," Coffee Zilla has since been publicly invited to go in Logan's podcast impulsive to talk"
1305320,1306320," about this."
1306320,1309040," Uh, he has declined for now on Twitter."
1309040,1310040," Yeah."
1310040,1311040," Okay."
1311040,1312040," This is the part where I was like, wait, what?"
1312040,1313040," Yeah."
1313040,1317520," He had Logan, he invited Logan first privately and then Logan publicly invited him."
1317520,1318520," Yeah."
1318520,1322840," So you mean that wasn't going to come out podcast like what?"
1322840,1326000," You didn't think coffee Zilla was going to go like, yeah, by the way, I invited this"
1326000,1327000," guy first."
1327000,1328000," Like you're getting exposed."
1328000,1330480," Why are you doing more stuff behind the scenes?"
1330480,1331480," So weird."
1331480,1335840," I mean, they, I mean, the drama gets more views."
1335840,1337400," The drama gets more views."
1337400,1338400," Fair enough."
1338400,1340640," It is something as a feature, not a bug."
1340640,1344320," That is something that he is legitimately very good at is stirring things."
1344320,1347480," Always has been coffee Zilla has been public."
1347480,1348480," Oh, right."
1348480,1351520," Already did that part."
1351520,1357840," He refuses to fly to his in quotes crypto zoo tax haven on New Year's LOL."
1357840,1359320," Ooh."
1359320,1360320," Ooh."
1360320,1361320," Yeah."
1361320,1363120," Good stuff."
1363120,1367920," So is there?"
1367920,1371400," As far as I know, board ape is getting, or a board eight yacht club or whatever is getting"
1371400,1375120," sued right now for like racism stuff or something."
1375120,1380000," Oh, like the NFT space is crumbling faster than I would have even expected."
1380000,1382200," I heard there's a, there's a company."
1382200,1386480," Man, I, okay, this is, this is, I only sort of vaguely remember reading about it."
1386480,1388720," So take this for what it is."
1388720,1396280," But I heard there's a company that specializes in helping you turn your NFTs into a tax write"
1396280,1401120," off that you can utilize for like this, this year, like this tax year."
1401120,1405240," Because you lost so much money on them."
1405240,1407080," And apparently business is booming."
1407080,1408080," Oh my."
1408080,1409080," Yeah."
1409080,1412120," Honestly, it was pretty well."
1412120,1413280," Whoever did that is smart."
1413280,1414280," Yeah."
1414280,1415280," Yeah."
1415280,1421160," I mean, you, I, you, if you lose money on an investment, you absolutely should try to,"
1421160,1425240," you know, get it at least non taxable."
1425240,1428400," Like if the money, if the money is lost, then it's lost."
1428400,1429720," Like it's not income."
1429720,1431120," That's for sure."
1431120,1434840," So I'm so opposite of that."
1434840,1435840," Yeah."
1435840,1436840," Yeah."
1436840,1437840," Pretty rough."
1437840,1438840," Now this is great."
1438840,1442800," I did not know this, which is sort of embarrassing."
1442800,1445640," Coffeezilla has made a video about me."
1445640,1446840," Oh, really?"
1446840,1448040," Yes."
1448040,1452440," It was back when we did that nice hash sponsored video."
1452440,1454360," And I obviously haven't watched it."
1454360,1455560," I'm very sorry."
1455560,1459280," I, I will, I will watch it at some point."
1459280,1462880," So I obviously haven't watched it, but let's go."
1462880,1470120," It is apparently focused on the criminal history of the founder of Nice Hash."
1470120,1471680," Oh."
1471680,1478680," Which I did become aware of after we uploaded that video that was sponsored by Nice Hash."
1478680,1482720," We did tell you guys after that on the following when show, there's actually comments under"
1482720,1483720," the video about it."
1483720,1484720," I was just looking."
1484720,1486680," I'm browsing the, I can't watch the video live."
1486680,1491400," So I'm browsing the comments to see sort of what was in it and what wasn't in it."
1491400,1494960," So people apparently a week later, we did address it on WAN show."
1494960,1497640," No, it was not something that I was aware of."
1497640,1500040," And we have not worked with Nice Hash since then."
1500040,1502040," We won't work with Nice Hash again."
1502040,1505440," With that said, that doesn't mean, and like I said at the time, it doesn't mean that"
1505440,1506440," I haven't used the product."
1506440,1508400," It doesn't mean that I wouldn't use the product."
1508400,1511680," It's been fine the times that I've used it."
1511680,1513440," In fact, I used it today."
1513440,1514680," We did a video."
1514680,1517920," The title is going to be Ask Me Why I'm Crypto Mining in 2023."
1517920,1520520," I know why it's great."
1520520,1525440," Anyway, I was lazy."
1525440,1529280," And as you will discover later on in the video, it doesn't really matter."
1529280,1536280," So we just, we use Nice Hash to effectively mine as a benchmark."
1536280,1544240," And so hopefully I'm going to watch this video and it's going to not be too bad."
1544240,1550800," I guess I have that to look forward to after the show."
1550800,1553200," Excuse me."
1553200,1555200," Hey, Al."
1555200,1556200," It's rough."
1556200,1557360," Alrighty, cool."
1557360,1560520," We've had a lot of sponsorships."
1560520,1561520," We've been around for a long time."
1561520,1566240," We've had a lot of sponsorships that have gone extremely well."
1566240,1568240," We've been around for a long time."
1568240,1570240," We've been around for a long time."
1570240,1572240," We've been around for a long time."
1572240,1574240," We've been around for a long time."
1574240,1576240," We've been around for a long time."
1576240,1579240," We've been around for a long time."
1579240,1582240," We've been around for a long time."
1582240,1585240," We've been around for a long time."
1585240,1588240," We've been around for a long time."
1588240,1590240," We've been around for a long time."
1590240,1592240," We've been around for a long time."
1592240,1594240," We've been around for a long time."
1594240,1596240," We've been around for a long time."
1596240,1598240," We've been around for a long time."
1598240,1600240," We've been around for a long time."
1600240,1602240," We've been around for a long time."
1602240,1604240," We've been around for a long time."
1604240,1606240," We've been around for a long time."
1606240,1608240," We've been around for a long time."

1996240,2000240," Do you want to be the person that has to defend them on a legal level?"
2000240,2002240," I don't think we ever have to."
2002240,2004240," Do you have to be the person that wants to defend them from governments trying to get their information?"
2004240,2008240," I was super busy at this period."
2008240,2010240," I was basically just getting small updates."
2010240,2014240," I think the only update I got was we're not doing it."
2014240,2016240," I was like, we're working on it."
2016240,2017240," It's awesome."
2017240,2018240," It's functioning."
2018240,2019240," We're going to give it a beta."
2019240,2020240," All these full plane users."
2020240,2023240," I think we were driving in the car somewhere."
2023240,2025240," I was like, yeah, by the way, the whole project's axed."
2025240,2026240," We're just done."
2026240,2028240," I was like, there's just no way."
2028240,2038240," They also said that even if it was as insulated as possible from this company, there's inevitably going to be similar ownership."
2038240,2040240," They'll come at you regardless."
2040240,2043240," It was scary for a bunch of reasons."
2043240,2048240," There were many individual reasons that by themselves would have axed the project."
2048240,2050240," There was a bunch of them."
2050240,2052240," There's no point in having this discussion."
2052240,2055240," No sane person is going to want to go along with this."
2055240,2056240," It's just the project."
2056240,2063240," It's not like you could just create in terms of service that are like, okay, here's how it's going to be."
2063240,2065240," We're cool if you're cool, bro."
2065240,2069240," If you do these illegal things, we're chill."
2069240,2073240," But if you do these illegal things, we're going to turn you over."
2073240,2076240," How are we supposed to be the arbiters of that?"
2076240,2080240," It's a lot easier for us to just say, forget about it."
2080240,2083240," I got to tell you, though, the money sure looked good."
2083240,2085240," Oh, my goodness."
2085240,2090240," When you do the math, man, we were like, rich."
2090240,2091240," It's going to be amazing."
2091240,2095240," You see the sales that people do on VPN accounts."
2095240,2096240," You're like, wow."
2096240,2097240," How can they make any money?"
2097240,2100240," You see the affiliate push that they're doing."
2100240,2102240," They're just sponsoring everybody."
2102240,2103240," It's crazy."
2103240,2105240," It's like, how is this possibly profitable?"
2105240,2110240," And then I'm not going to say who it was mostly because I don't remember."
2110240,2115240," But there was a VPN out there that exposed the amount of users that they had."
2115240,2117240," They had free users and paid users."
2117240,2120240," They exposed the amount of users that they had under both categories."
2120240,2125240," And they showed the amount of bandwidth going through at all points in time."
2125240,2126240," Yeah."
2126240,2131240," And they showed where all of their individual servers were around the entire world."
2131240,2136240," And if you know a bunch of stuff about server hosting, you can kind of figure out who those"
2136240,2138240," servers are hosted with."
2138240,2143240," So you can get a really crazily accurate and like costing."
2143240,2151240," Well, especially if you're our team who probably has Rackspace in like those data centers."
2151240,2152240," Yeah."
2152240,2153240," Already."
2153240,2154240," Right."
2154240,2155240," Well, there's even there."
2155240,2156240," They got really specific."
2156240,2157240," Yeah."
2157240,2158240," That's the one."
2158240,2159240," That is the one."
2159240,2162840," I've got a lot of like how much money they're probably making, how much money this is probably"
2162840,2163840," costing them."
2163840,2166080," And like, no, obviously it's not free to be able to have this."
2166080,2169240," You need like a mesh of servers around the world."
2169240,2171240," There's a decent amount of startup cost."
2171240,2172240," Yeah."
2172240,2176240," But like the second you get a reasonable amount of users."
2176240,2177240," Whoa."
2177240,2179240," It's a money printing machine."
2179240,2180240," Big money."
2180240,2182240," I can totally understand why people get into it."
2182240,2183240," A lot of money."
2183240,2184240," Yeah."
2184240,2185240," So the money."
2185240,2186240," Yeah."
2186240,2187240," And then there's all the downsides."
2187240,2192240," And it's like, whoa, this is not something that I want to help with."
2192240,2193240," Really?"
2193240,2197640," So we left actually a pretty monstrous amount of money on the table."
2197640,2201440," And we left a project that was like ready for beta testing."
2201440,2202440," Like it was ready to go."
2202440,2203440," Yeah."
2203440,2204440," It was actually quite sophisticated."
2204440,2205440," It was good."
2205440,2206440," Yeah."
2206440,2207440," It was made well."
2207440,2210640," The people that worked on it were proud of it and they should have been like we to be clear."
2210640,2212340," We didn't code it from scratch."
2212340,2213640," We did what you should do."
2213640,2216040," And we leaned on a lot of open source tools for it."
2216040,2217040," For sure."
2217040,2223520," And that's part of maintaining at least some facade of transparency."
2223520,2227640," We wanted to use the open source tools because then people could see how it works."
2227640,2229440," More better."
2229440,2231360," Yeah."
2231360,2234800," And you can like, I think we've even made a video of like this is how you make your"
2234800,2235800," own VPN."
2235800,2238360," Like you can do it yourself, stuff like that."
2238360,2244200," But I mean, we had some, I had some kind of cool ideas for how we could differentiate"
2244200,2245200," as well."
2245200,2249720," You know, trust no one, but here's why you can trust us."
2249720,2256840," You know, like I, I had the idea of like creating some kind of, some kind of legal framework"
2256840,2263760," for guaranteeing that the ownership would never change from like me and Yvonne and Luke"
2263760,2265000," or something like that."
2265000,2274440," Like basically it's, it would be the trust us bro terms of service, which isn't perfect."
2274440,2279160," But if we're willing to get out there personally and say, no, no, it's all on us instead of"
2279160,2281000," just like, well, I don't know."
2281000,2285440," I mean, it's all good, but we might sell and then who knows who's going to own it after."
2285440,2286440," Right."
2286440,2288840," Cause that's, I don't think you finished that conversation, but that was a problem that"
2288840,2291440," you had with some VPNs that were sponsoring us."
2291440,2292440," Yep."
2292440,2294840," Is because we'd be happy with where they are at, but then they would sell."
2294840,2297760," It's like, well, all the user data just changed hands."
2297760,2298840," Now what?"
2298840,2303120," And maybe it changed hands to a group that someone isn't cool with."
2303120,2304120," Maybe it did."
2304120,2305120," I don't know."
2305120,2306120," Who knows?"
2306120,2309400," It's just, it's just an awkward situation to be in and I just got kind of tired of it."
2309400,2310400," So yeah."
2310400,2311400," Yeah."
2311400,2313520," There's the, there's the flow VPN story."
2313520,2314520," Yeah."
2314520,2318640," Man, should we, should we tell some, should we, should we continue story time?"
2318640,2319640," What else?"
2319640,2320640," There's probably lots."
2320640,2321640," I don't know."
2321640,2325320," Should we talk about the, should we talk about the time that Linus Media Group got an offer"
2325320,2326320," for acquisition?"
2326320,2327320," No."
2327320,2331200," Well, I mean, we could clearly said no."
2331200,2332760," So there you go."
2332760,2333960," What clearly said no?"
2333960,2334960," Yeah."
2334960,2335960," You clearly said no?"
2335960,2336960," No."
2336960,2337960," Well, I mean, we didn't get acquired."
2337960,2342000," No, we didn't, we didn't get acquired, but you know what, maybe we'll talk about that"
2342000,2343000," later."
2343000,2347840," For now, if you guys have anything you want to talk about on the show, it's a perfect"
2347840,2349200," time to send in a merch message."
2349200,2351160," Oh, oh, we launched a new product."
2351160,2353280," I have to address while you figure that out."
2353280,2354280," Yeah."
2354280,2356080," I have to address someone just said float VPN sync."
2356080,2357320," That is untrue."
2357320,2359320," It went into the dry dock and it got decommissioned."
2359320,2360320," Okay."
2360320,2361320," Yeah."
2361320,2362320," It was fine."
2362320,2363320," Yeah."
2363320,2364800," Oh, he's, he's stripping on stream."
2364800,2365800," Let's go."
2365800,2367080," Oh, you're not allowed to strip on stream."
2367080,2368080," This is not stripping."
2368080,2370120," This is just he's reconfiguring."
2370120,2371120," Yeah."
2371120,2373560," Fabric objects below the table."
2373560,2374560," Yeah."
2374560,2375560," It's all good."
2375560,2376560," He's what is it?"
2376560,2377560," Sorry."
2377560,2381720," You're working on the eco infrastructure of the database."
2381720,2382880," Yeah."
2382880,2384840," Yeah."
2384840,2386080," I want to find the line."
2386080,2387480," I want to say it specifically."
2387480,2390720," Prove I'm not wearing pants."
2390720,2391720," That should be."
2391720,2392720," That should be the."
2392720,2394600," Oh, did the knee come up?"
2394600,2395760," Oh, maybe."
2395760,2397800," Where is it?"
2397800,2398800," I got to find it."
2398800,2399800," Okay."
2399800,2400800," Here it is."
2400800,2402560," Undergrowing upgrades to the core infrastructure of the ecosystem."
2402560,2407240," He's undergoing upgrades to the core infrastructure of the leg covering system."
2407240,2408240," Yeah."
2408240,2409240," Yeah."
2409240,2410240," There we go."
2410240,2411240," Perfect."
2411240,2412240," Hey, we launched pajama pants."
2412240,2413240," Yeah."
2413240,2414240," Whoo."
2414240,2415240," Those actually look really comfy."
2415240,2416240," Yeah."
2416240,2417240," They're super comfy."
2417240,2421240," Only the only the finest pajama pants for LTT store shoppers."
2421240,2424640," Here is where's my dang it."
2424640,2426760," Where's my where's my talking points about it?"
2426760,2427760," You know what?"
2427760,2428760," It doesn't matter."
2428760,2429760," I'll just go on the site."
2429760,2430760," LTT store.com."
2430760,2431760," Let's go."
2431760,2433960," The pajama pants."
2433960,2434960," New plaid."
2434960,2438160," Oh, oh, that's right."
2438160,2439920," Did we even talk about new plaid yet?"
2439920,2440920," No."
2440920,2441920," Oh, yeah."
2441920,2442920," There's new."
2442920,2443920," There's crying out loud."
2443920,2444920," It's a good."
2444920,2445920," It's a great site."
2445920,2446920," Screwdriver."
2446920,2447920," Good site."
2447920,2448920," Good site."
2448920,2449920," Oh, yeah."
2449920,2450920," And so we've got all these different colors of plaids now."
2450920,2451920," Whoo."
2451920,2453880," Pretty fun."
2453880,2458800," The plaid flannel is extremely well reviewed."
2458800,2464680," Every once in a while, I will just read through reviews on our site because it's nice."
2464680,2469960," And the number of people that are like, yeah, it's expensive."
2469960,2476920," But I've had this plaid flannel for like the last 25 years and I never thought I'd find"
2476920,2478840," something that could replace it."
2478840,2480760," But this one replaced it."
2480760,2483280," It's pretty awesome."
2483280,2485520," Really stoked on that one."
2485520,2489120," Also the pajama pants."
2489120,2494960," Not going to lie, we went back and forth on the pricing for this one based on our kind"
2494960,2496680," of margin targets."
2496680,2501560," It should have probably been more like $44.99 to $49.99."
2501560,2506520," But even though they're like amazing, okay, I touched my leg."
2506520,2508520," Oh, you're not?"
2508520,2509520," That is pretty nice."
2509520,2510520," I think you want me to go higher?"
2510520,2513520," Yeah, I mean, I'm getting higher."
2513520,2518400," Even though they're like, even though they're like amazing, it seemed like a lot."
2518400,2520440," So we ended up with $39.99."
2520440,2528960," They're a blend of rayon from bamboo, merino wool and spandex."
2528960,2531960," They really make you feel like you're wearing nothing at all."
2531960,2534680," Oh, nothing at all."
2534680,2535680," Nothing at all."
2535680,2536680," They're actually quite flattering too."
2536680,2537840," In my humble opinion."
2537840,2539840," They look sharp."
2539840,2540840," I like the gray."
2540840,2541840," Yeah."
2541840,2543320," Did you say what color they are?"
2543320,2545040," It's like they're gray."
2545040,2546240," Yeah, it's a gray."
2546240,2547240," Yeah."
2547240,2548240," Yeah."
2548240,2550880," So super stoked on the pajama pants."
2550880,2553480," I'm glad."
2553480,2554480," Yeah."
2554480,2557480," I like my I have the like original red plaid."
2557480,2559160," I like it quite a bit."
2559160,2560160," Yeah."
2560160,2561160," Nice."
2561160,2562160," All right."
2562160,2563160," What else are we what?"
2563160,2565440," Oh, yeah, let's uh, should you do standard sponsors?"
2565440,2566440," Oh, sure."
2566440,2567440," Sure."
2567440,2568440," Yeah."
2568440,2569440," Let's get those."
2569440,2570440," All right."
2570440,2573440," So I'm going to show you some of the things that I'm going to do."
2573440,2576440," I'm going to show you some of the things that I'm going to do."
2576440,2579440," I'm going to show you some of the things that I'm going to do."
2579440,2582440," I'm going to show you some of the things that I'm going to do."
2582440,2585440," I'm going to show you some of the things that I'm going to do."
2585440,2588440," I'm going to show you some of the things that I'm going to do."
2588440,2591440," I'm going to show you some of the things that I'm going to do."
2591440,2593440," I'm going to show you some of the things that I'm going to do."
2593440,2595440," I'm going to show you some of the things that I'm going to do."
2595440,2596440," I'm going to show you some of the things that I'm going to do."
2596440,2597440," I'm going to show you some of the things that I'm going to do."
2597440,2601360," if you're building a new system and looking for a power supply, can't recommend it enough."
2601360,2609040," It's very expensive though. So fortunately, CSONIC has a whole lineup ranging from all the way to"
2609040,2616240," entry level and are all the way from entry level to the very, very top of the line. Can't say enough"
2616240,2624320," good things about CSONIC. These guys are absolute chads like who else would have the stones, okay,"
2624320,2631760," to help you configure a lab grade power supply tester so that you can better compare their products"
2631760,2637200," against everything else. If you're not a pretty Chad move, if that doesn't say confident,"
2637200,2642240," I don't know what else does. I have CSONIC power supplies that are like ancient technology at this"
2642240,2648160," point and they just keep going. I don't know. It's not I'm not recommending that you use like"
2648160,2653360," super old power supplies, but they have 12 year warranties. And like I have power supplies that"
2653360,2657920," are legitimately that older, older, and they're still fine. And they're from CSONIC. So I don't"
2657920,2662880," think I will throw my personal badge on that. The show is also brought to you by Manscaped."
2662880,2668080," Their ultra premium collection is an all in one skin and hair care kit designed to keep the"
2668080,2674320," everyday man covered from head to toe or less covered as it were. There's the two and one shampoo"
2674320,2679280," and conditioner, their body wash infused with a la vera, hydrating body spray, deodorant,"
2679280,2684800," and a free gift moisturized lip balm. So simplify your man maintenance with Manscaped. And best of"
2684800,2689840," all, all of their products in the ultra premium collection are cruelty free, paraben free, and"
2689840,2696480," vegan. Just visit Manscaped.com/tech or click the link down below for 20% off and free shipping."
2696480,2704720," Finally, speaking of longtime sponsors, the show is brought to you by Squarespaced. Squarespaced."
2704720,2708480," Really Linus? They're only like a little spaced out there."
2708480,2715040," I'm trying to think. We're maybe our first or second direct sponsor."
2715040,2717200," Like non-hardware? Yeah."
2717200,2719600," Oh, non-hardware. I'm almost certain they're the first."
2719600,2722720," Corsair was the first hardware."
2722720,2725680," Corsair was the very first sponsor ever of anything."
2725680,2730320," So Corsair was first, but I think Squarespace might have been, I think they were the first"
2730320,2734640," when show sponsor. When show was really hard to sell back in the day, now sponsors can't get"
2734640,2738720," enough of it. If you go back far enough, when show used to only have two sponsor spots."
2738720,2748000," And now it has three because we couldn't do more when shows. And sponsors were like kicking down"
2748000,2753040," our door, trying to pay for when show. So eventually, I think it was Nick at the time,"
2753040,2756240," not Colton in charge of the business team at that point. He was just like,"
2757520,2765440," look, you are leaving literally 50% of the revenue for when show on the table by not just taking"
2765440,2770960," another sponsorship. And I was like, all right, we'll try it one week. And then I was hooked."
2770960,2773840," Hooked on Squarespace. Yeah."
2773840,2778480," What's Squarespace? Making a website doesn't have to be hard. You can have your website up and"
2778480,2781600," running in a matter of hours. I mean, if you're good, you can have it up and running in a matter"
2781600,2786560," of minutes. Squarespace has award-winning templates that will help your website stand out. So say"
2786560,2793680," goodbye to drab, geo cities inspired hellscapes and say hello to Squarespace scapes. Plus,"
2793680,2798000," if you're interested in how your website is doing, they have built-in tools to help find out what"
2798000,2803040," you're doing right and what you're doing wrong. Both our Linus Media Group.com and LTXXPro websites"
2803040,2807760," were built quickly using Squarespace. And if you get stuck, they have a 24/7 support team that is"
2807760,2813120," ready to help you out. Go to squarespace.com/when and you can get 10% off today."
2813120,2818800," But if you're good, he mostly means like at typing text to go on the screen and putting"
2818800,2824320," pictures in places. Like you don't have to be like skilled technical. Yeah, yeah, you don't have to"
2824320,2828960," do any of that stuff. You just have to be like, this is the name of my company. This is what we do."
2828960,2836640," Here's a picture. All right. Wait, did I explain how to use merch messages or did I just get"
2836640,2840880," totally derailed and start talking about how comfortable these pajama pants are? If you buy"
2840880,2845360," something on LTT Store in the checkout when we're live, there's a place to submit a merch message."
2845360,2851040," Dan might reply to you down here or you might just get if you just want like a shout out or whatever,"
2851040,2855280," that'll come up down here. Sometimes he curates things for us to talk about later on in the show."
2855280,2859120," But first, we're going to have to talk about some more topics here. Should we do the LTXX"
2859120,2864000," weekly updates really quick? No, I think we got to do New York passes right to repair bill"
2864880,2875840," after neutering it. Rossman's **** and rightly so. The Digital Fair Repair Act has become the first"
2875840,2881040," right to repair bill in the US that has been signed into law by New York State Governor Kathy"
2881040,2885360," Hoachol. I don't know if you pronounce that. This is after this is months after bipartisan"
2885360,2890960," majorities passed it through the state legislature. Note President Biden did issue an executive order"
2890960,2894800," last year, which directs federal agencies to issue right to repair rules. But this is the first"
2894800,2901280," right to repair bill to actually be signed into law. The bill requires electronics OEMs to provide"
2901280,2906720," manuals, diagrams, diagnostic tools, and parts to product owners and repair shops."
2906720,2915600," But while many right to repair advocates, including iFixit CEO Kyle Wiens, have celebrated the"
2915600,2921120," fact that the bill passed at all, others are criticizing the heavy modifications that were"
2921120,2926400," made to the bill thanks to lobbying efforts by trade groups like TechNet, whose members include"
2926400,2934480," Apple, sorry, that's the wrong finger, Apple, Amazon, Google, Meta, Snap, HP, GM, Toyota. It's"
2934480,2941200," basically everybody. Certain products and industries are exempted for one thing, including home appliances."
2941200,2945760," Why? Yeah. Motor vehicles. Why? Definitely shouldn't be that either."
2945760,2956800," Medical devices? F*** you. Why? Honestly. Why? Off-road equipment? That's, yeah. Well,"
2956800,2961920," I mean John Deere's got to protect their margins somehow, right? There was definitely lobbying"
2961920,2967920," there. And business to business or business to government products not sold by retailers."
2967920,2977280," So basically any direct sales to a large volume buyer. It also added that OEMs may provide"
2977280,2984400," assemblies of parts rather than individual components when the risk of improper installation"
2984400,2992000," heightens the risk of injury. So I guess we just need to buy an entire $800 laptop motherboard instead"
2992000,2998560," of a $20 cooler because those fins could be really sharp. I guess, I mean, I was outraged when I"
2998560,3003280," found out, remember the iMac Pro debacle? I was outraged when I found out that you couldn't just"
3003280,3007920," get a motherboard. Oh no, a motherboard includes a CPU and RAM. What? Because I'm too incompetent to"
3007920,3012400," plug in a CPU and RAM. I mean, never mind that we did break it in the first place, but I was"
3012400,3019360," willing to pay for a new one if I broke it. The law will also only apply to new products sold for"
3019360,3029520," the first time in New York, honor after July 1st, 2023. So basically, it has no fangs, doesn't apply to"
3029520,3037440," most of the most important segments. And there's ways that they can work around it and basically"
3037440,3043200," not change anything. So it's a bunch of fluff. I do still think that attitudes are shifting."
3044000,3049920," The fact that Apple introduced their home repair program at all, the fact that Microsoft started"
3049920,3055520," discussing right to repair at all, is it Dell with the super cool app Dell with Project Luna,"
3055520,3064240," the fact that that's happening at all is good. Yes. And it's progress. But this setback shows that"
3064240,3069200," we have to keep the pressure on and that lobbying is effective and that lobbying is also effective."
3069200,3078000," The money rates grows. It sure is. It's super gross. And that should be bipartisan because it's"
3078000,3082560," gross in every direction. Someone was asking why only in New York because in America,"
3082560,3085760," it's basically 52 small countries."
3085760,3094480," As far as I can tell, and this is just based on my experience dealing with tax law in the US."
3094480,3098880," Yeah, it's a little confusing. It is. As far as I know, it's confusing to insiders too though."
3098880,3108880," It is wild how different the experience of being an American can be like three meters away that way."
3108880,3113760," That's about nine feet. I know of American companies that think that American tax law is so"
3113760,3120160," confusing. Major companies that you have used, I pretty much guarantee it, that find tax law in"
3120160,3124960," America to be so confusing that their official stance when their company was coming up was to"
3124960,3131840," completely ignore all of it. And when different sections of the states, because there's like"
3131840,3135840," a billion of them, because it goes down to like counties and stuff individually,"
3135840,3140480," yeah, we can would get mad at them for not paying their taxes properly. They would just ask them"
3140480,3146880," how to do it and then do it moving forward and then never update it until that area got mad"
3146880,3150880," about it because they're doing it wrong now and then would send them a new letter because they"
3150880,3156960," decided that it would cost them less money to deal with the fines than it would working with a company"
3156960,3161920," who kept track of all of it and then took money for doing that. Our chief financial officer"
3161920,3171680," doesn't have the, I don't know, I don't know what to call it, the stress tolerance to take a"
3171680,3177760," build a war chest and just pay fines kind of approach to that stuff. We actually do try to do"
3177760,3183280," things properly and proactively. But that it, that is a, but it's really hard. That is a"
3183280,3189120," legitimate approach that has been used by multi-billion dollar companies. I get asked on a regular"
3189120,3193760," basis, Linus, why don't you guys have a shipping DC in the States? Why don't you have a shipping"
3193760,3199760," DC in Europe? Why don't you do this? Why don't you do that? Because to do it properly is really,"
3199760,3205520," really hard. Taxes are hypercom, really hard. Our accounting department is."
3206720,3210720," So what someone? Five people now. Someone who flew a plane shot said there's 6,000"
3210720,3216240," tax jurisdictions that they need to keep track of. Yeah, and the documentation for it is atrocious."
3216240,3224160," Like consider, okay, here. Some counties in the US still send out physical mail to local stores"
3224160,3230320," to tell them when taxes update. Well, I'm clearly not going to get that mailer. Like,"
3231920,3237920," I was going to say, consider how like broken the processes are for something as simple as,"
3237920,3243040," you know, getting your ID or even like a library card in many municipalities."
3243040,3251760," Well, it's not like they put their A team on the tax documentation. They're just isn't an A team."
3251760,3256560," They can just find you. So why would they care? Yeah, they ultimately don't care. That's the,"
3256560,3261360," man, that's really frustrating. The fact that they can just kick it back to you and say,"
3261360,3266480," well, it's your fault for not understanding it. Here's your bill. It's like outrageous."
3266480,3272960," California is one that I particularly take issue with their approach. California seems to think"
3272960,3278480," that as a foreign national, I am somehow obligated to pay them income tax."
3278480,3290880," That's a new one. And so as a foreign national, running a foreign incorporated"
3291600,3300560," entity, they seem to think that if some proportion of our income comes from California-based entities,"
3300560,3305360," that they are entitled to income tax from you personally? From my company."
3305360,3313280," I mean, it's still messed up. To which I would say, under what authority,"
3315760,3321360," like, what are you going to do? Canada's not going to extradite me to California."
3321360,3326080," Yeah, but you travel there sometimes. I could just not. I stopped traveling to China."
3326080,3329600," I don't go to China anymore after they abducted the Michaels. I'm just like, I'm sorry, what?"
3329600,3336320," Are you kidding me? I love how casually it's just like, remember when they abducted the Michael"
3336320,3340960," Slim? Well, you did. I know exactly what you're talking about. They did. They were like, hey,"
3340960,3350640," that completely justified apprehension of a Huawei executive. We didn't like it because we're"
3350640,3357760," an authoritarian state. So we're just going to casually abduct some Canadians and not give"
3357760,3363200," them back until you just say, yeah, it's all cool. Laws don't apply to Chinese nationals. So"
3365120,3373840," what? Yeah. Yep. That do be a thing. Yep. They're back now, which is good, but like,"
3373840,3379120," I'm just not going to go there anymore. That's what happens, China. You don't get"
3379120,3384880," minus anymore. That's right. I even still have a valid visa. I can go there for like another four"
3384880,3391280," years. I mean, based on that I've said this now and mentioned Winnie the Pooh, totally out of context."
3391280,3398160," Yeah. I probably shouldn't. Yeah. We go there together. Instead of the Michaels,"
3398160,3403120," it becomes the people whose names start with L. They just take both of us. The line is loose."
3403120,3413280," That's a big L right there and a small L. We got them both. Oh my goodness. Yeah."
3413280,3419760," Okay. We did that one. I'm going to do the LTX update really quick just because I'm"
3419760,3422880," certain we're going to forget. Hold on. I want to make something really clear."
3422880,3429680," To our Chinese viewers and the people living in China in general. Fair enough."
3429680,3435280," Obviously. I hope this is obvious. I bear you no ill will whatsoever. No, no at all."
3435280,3445440," But the CCP can go ******* off and that is not, and to be clear, that is not exclusive to the CCP."
3446480,3454480," I don't, I think it would be hard for me to think of, I don't think I can, off the top of my head,"
3454480,3461280," think of a world government or a world governing body that frankly shouldn't just go *******"
3461280,3467600," self. That's probably some somewhere. I don't know. I remember for a while there,"
3467600,3473040," this was quite a while ago and I didn't look into it deep enough and someone's probably going to"
3473040,3476720," point out some crazy human rights violation that I didn't know about and I'm going to look like a"
3476720,3480880," bad person. But quite a while ago, I used to think the government of Estonia was pretty cool."
3480880,3486240," That's going to sound really random. The reason why was they digitized a bunch of their governance"
3486240,3494400," and got rid of a massive amount of cost, which when government has cost, it means you have"
3494400,3501440," paid money. So they got rid of a ton of cost by digitizing a bunch of it. And they automated like"
3501440,3506560," huge amounts of their governance. And then they started exporting these governance tools"
3506560,3511840," as a export of the country. So they started making money from it. And I'm like, this is"
3511840,3517840," cool. I don't know what happened with that. That was a long time ago. I know basically nothing"
3517840,3525120," about the country. I just thought that one specific thing was cool. I don't, I don't want to,"
3525120,3530960," I'm not dying on this sword. That's what I'm saying. I'm not interested in that. I just thought"
3530960,3537600," that was kind of neat because yeah, Estonia or whatever, because I, you try to do like so many"
3537600,3543600," different things with government. And it's so tedious. And it's like, oh, I have to fact something,"
3543600,3548640," or I have to like go into this office physically to pay this like $20 tax bill."
3548640,3551040," You ready for another story time? Sure. Yeah."
3551040,3558800," Okay. I got a new car. Yeah. It's pretty cool. I imported it from. Oh, yeah. The story."
3558800,3565360," The province of Quebec. Okay. Anytime if you're, if you're out for most on Canada,"
3565360,3573280," anytime you touch Quebec in any way, it's a disaster. Anytime. Again, shout out the people of"
3573280,3577600," Quebec. Yeah. Love you very much. Great. We employ two of them. They're fantastic."
3577600,3583040," Very happy with both of them on the team. But some of the Quebec government policies"
3583680,3590800," actually seem to be written by idiots. And yeah. Yep. I mean, they screw over people in Quebec"
3590800,3594800," more than anything. You hear about giveaways that include Canada and they're like everywhere"
3594800,3601440," in North America, except specifically Quebec. It's like, oh, that's not because companies hate"
3601440,3610160," you. Yeah. It's because your government hates you. Yeah. It's brutal. Anyway. Oh, so is Quebec the"
3610160,3614320," California of Canada? No, I wouldn't say they're the California. The weather isn't very good."
3614320,3620080," What would you say Quebec is? Alberta is definitely our Texas. Yep. I don't think there's a lot of"
3620080,3624080," other easy. I mean, Quebec's sort of like they're like, California's in the sense that they just"
3624080,3629680," like want to secede all the time. Not recently, mind you. So does Texas. Yeah. So does Texas. Yeah,"
3629680,3634080," but Texas is the Alberta also wants to secede all the time. So like the Alberta, Texas. Yeah,"
3634080,3640880," that's that's relationship is clearly Vancouver is Washington or BC is Washington."
3640880,3644800," It's got people saying they're the Florida. I could kind of see that. They just kind of do their own thing."
3644800,3655120," But you don't hear like Quebec man has wrestled an alligator. Yeah, that's that's true. That's true."
3655120,3662560," Probably because it would have said an um, the Quebec, you know, they would be in French. So"
3662560,3665760," you wouldn't have understood it. Fair enough. I know. So do moose."
3665760,3673200," Let's let's go. Let's go back to story time. I imported a car from Quebec. There were a couple"
3673200,3681680," of compelling reasons to do this. Yeah. It is a second hand EV, which means that this particular"
3681680,3687760," unit because it's second hand, but with only about 1300 kilometers. Okay. So that is like"
3688800,3694720," less than a thousand miles on it. So it's a used car with less than a thousand miles on it because"
3694720,3702320," it's used. It is exempt from um, PST provincial sales tax, which is what about 5% or something like"
3702320,3709840," that? I don't know, but I'll check. Also because it's used and it's 7% over the yeah, 7%. Okay. So I"
3709840,3717040," save 7% right out of the gate from it being second hand. Also because it's used, uh, it's a used EV."
3717440,3724080," Oh wait, if it is used EV, so it is not subject to PST. Also because it is second hand, it is not"
3724080,3733600," subject to the luxury tax, which saved me. Um, I forget what the actual amount is in BC on cars."
3733600,3741920," Ah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Yeah, but hold on. BC luxury tax calculator. Um,"
3744240,3750560," a lot. Quite a few thousands of dollars. So importing this car from Quebec made a ton of"
3750560,3756960," financial sense, even though it costs like $4,000 to ship it here. Like it was way that was way less"
3756960,3764640," than the amount that I saved on it. Yeah. Okay. So because it's from out of province, even though"
3764640,3770640," it's a car that was shipped to Canada to a Canadian and registered in Canada, because it was registered"
3770640,3776320," in another province, I have to go through some, some rigmarole. Okay. So I have to get it a safety"
3776320,3782480," inspection done before I can register it in BC. It's like fair enough. Uh, let me tell you that"
3782480,3789040," was a quick inspection. I mean, it's got a thousand miles on it. And it's an EV. And it's an EV. What"
3789040,3793600," could go wrong? So pretty quick inspection. So that was good. Um, so I went and I got that done."
3793600,3802640," And I went to in, in BC, we have this, uh, crown corporation monopoly on automotive insurance called"
3802640,3810160," ICBC. And basically the theory is that by having it be a crown corporation, which means a government"
3810160,3818960," owned entity, um, they can, um, spread the, the, the load of insurance claims over the entire"
3818960,3824400," population of the province, uh, lowering everyone's rates in practice, particularly when the BC"
3824400,3830160," liberals were in power. That is certainly not how it worked out. Um, the NDP have actually done a"
3830160,3836000," much, much better job of getting our premiums down over the last three, four years, which kudos"
3836000,3840800," to them for that fair. It was helped by almost no one being on the roads for two years. That"
3840800,3845200," didn't hurt. Yep. Yep. That's true. But I mean, hey, if the savings get passed along to me, that's"
3845200,3848720," supposed to be how it works. Yeah. And they did. They literally sent out checks."
3848720,3854720," So great. Right. So anyway, um, in theory, that's how it's supposed to work. But in practice, as"
3854720,3863920," you guys know, um, in the absence of competition, well, you tend to find complacency and the way that,"
3863920,3869440," um, I wish government agencies worked was that their constituents were the customer."
3869440,3875680," But the way that government agencies actually work is that, um, you know, whatever minister is"
3875680,3880400," in charge of that particular agency is the customer and they don't seem to have any"
3880400,3885680," accountability to anybody whatsoever. So you end up getting treated like an inconvenience,"
3885680,3891680," as opposed to a valued customer. So here's what happened. When I went in to get my vehicle"
3891680,3898160," registered and insured in BC, I had to bring three documents. One was the inspection report."
3898160,3904000," One was the registration of the vehicle from the previous owner in Quebec. And the third was the"
3904000,3910880," bill of sale showing that I had purchased the vehicle, paid my GST. So that's the federal,"
3910880,3918480," the general sales tax paid my GST and, um, like that I was me, you know, that, that,"
3918480,3921760," that I was the one who was supposed to own it so that when I registered, it would be registered to"
3921760,3926720," the right person. Here's what happens. Okay. So we've got, we've got a local billionaire,"
3926720,3932720," uh, Jimmy Patterson, pretty well known for his philanthropic works and, uh, he plays a mean, uh,"
3932720,3936080," what does he play? Trumpet or something like that. He plays with the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra"
3936080,3940400," from time to time. Really? For real. I went to see like, I forget if it was like Star Wars night"
3940400,3944240," or something like that. And at the beginning, they were like, by the way, we have a special"
3944240,3948400," performer tonight. The one and only Jimmy Patterson is, and he stands up"
3951360,3957120," guys of pro. Uh, anyway, yeah, right. Um, just like rich people hobbies, I guess. Yeah. I think"
3957120,3962240," I'll just, I think I'll just casually, okay. Like I don't know how internationally famous the"
3962240,3966320," Vancouver Symphony Orchestra is, but they're, they're pretty in baller. Like they're pretty good."
3966320,3970240," They're great. I actually really like, you want to see them? So you just like casually, you should go."
3970240,3974800," Yeah. Just just casually plays with the van, with the VSO. And this was a number of years back."
3974800,3979680," I don't know if he still does. He's pretty old now. Anyway, the point is that you know how he owns,"
3979680,3985440," uh, many car dealerships. Many, many, many. Okay. So Jim Patterson group is the, the car dealership,"
3985440,3991760," like conglomerate, right? Okay. And within Jim Patterson group, you've got Jim Patterson,"
3991760,3996320," Toyota, Jim Patterson, you know, whatever else, like all the, all the different like sub brands."
3996320,3999920," And sometimes I think he has more than one dealership for a particular brand in different"
3999920,4007840," locations. So it was basically like that. Okay. The, I'm going to give away something about the"
4007840,4013200," car here, I guess. But the, the registration. Someone's already guessed it. Oh, really?"
4013200,4017360," I mean, there's been a ton of guesses. So I will say that and no one will have any idea what that"
4017360,4029200," means. Okay. So the, the registration was to group Lauson and then, um, the, the bill of sale was from,"
4029200,4034480," This is going to give a lot of way. Portia Lauson. Okay. That's way more on the nose that I even"
4034480,4042480," thought you were going. But all right. Yeah. And basically because those two documents didn't match,"
4042480,4051680," ICBC said that they could not establish continuity for the ownership of the vehicle. Yeah. Because"
4051680,4058480," they said it was a different entity selling me the vehicle than it was registered to prior."
4061680,4068560," So the broker that I was at, not to be clear guys, it could have been any vehicle. It's a used car."
4068560,4078960," So don't get too smart here. The point is, I, we, I worked every angle. It's a really nice used car."
4078960,4086320," I worked every angle with the broker. Okay. Every angle I could think of. Can they send you an email"
4086320,4091520," confirming that they are the same entity? Can you go on their website and see that they are the"
4091520,4095920," same entity? Because, because again, the Jim Patterson thing is not, it's obviously not Jim"
4095920,4100240," Patterson, but it's effectively the same deal. It's super obvious that it's the same entity."
4100240,4106160," Yes. It's like every level. It's right on the website. Yeah. The only reason that you can't"
4106160,4113280," establish continuity is because you refuse to look at it. Um, we got as far as, so what they"
4113280,4118320," wanted was they wanted them to create new documents. And I was like, these are legal documents."
4118320,4122800," The entity that sold it to me is called this and the entity it was registered to was called this."
4122800,4125920," They're not going to legally rename their company. No, they're not going to do that."
4125920,4133280," So that's not a real solution. So you need to give me a real solution. Um, I even, I even pointed"
4133280,4138080," out that if you go on the government, like the dot, B C dot gov dot QC or whatever it is,"
4138080,4142880," IQC dot gov, like the official government of Quebec website and you do a search for Group La"
4142880,4147760," Zong. It has all of the dealerships that are part, they're like, we can't look at that. I'm like,"
4147760,4149920," no, no, no, no, no, no. It's literally government."
4149920,4154560," They literally scanned this and sent it to you. I know you've seen it. I can't see it."
4154560,4158400," No, you know, you did see it though. Can you see that they're the same thing? I cannot."
4158400,4166480," Fuck you. Like for real though. Fuck you. Like you do know, you do see it. This is not a problem."
4166480,4170400," The dealership said that they had shipped a vehicle into BC literally five weeks ago."
4170400,4175280," And it wasn't a problem at all. The documentation was exactly the same. There was no problem."
4175280,4181520," Basically, what I think we ran into was someone who kind of misunderstood and the"
4181520,4185520," documents were in French, right? So it's going to be easy to misunderstand."
4185520,4190720," Kind of misunderstood a little. Sure. They gave an answer. And then once they gave an answer,"
4190720,4195440," was unable to back down. Yeah. And you run into that a lot in bureaucracies."
4195440,4201120," Oh, yeah, absolutely. Like a lot. And it's so frustrating. If they were customer service driven,"
4201120,4207440," they would be looking for a way to help you. But because they are not customer service driven,"
4207440,4212960," they are looking for a way to, I don't know, justify their own existence on the other end of the phone"
4212960,4218800," line. They wasted between my son, who I thought this was a 10 minute errand and brought with me,"
4218800,4225600," the agent at the auto plan broker, me and them, they managed to waste probably about eight hours"
4225600,4230000," of people's time going back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and back and forth on"
4230000,4235440," all these different potential solutions. What they ultimately settled on was that they wanted a letter"
4235440,4242880," signed by like a signatory officer of Group La Zon that said that they were the same company."
4242880,4252320," And it could not be faxed or emailed or docu signed or anything. It had to be the original document."
4252320,4258800," The auto time brokers like this is unprecedented. Why can't you fax it directly to us? That is like,"
4258800,4264320," that is a legally valid way of transmitted a document, right? And they're like, it cannot."
4264320,4268240," Basically what they decided was they didn't want me to get my car insured that day."
4268240,4275440," And this is where ultimately I come back to what you were talking about, where digitizing this kind"
4275440,4282000," of stuff is a customer first way of dealing with things. And this is something that we talked"
4282000,4288080," about when he was first telling me this is like the argument for not replacing these systems with"
4288080,4293760," automation is that the people should be able to handle those types of situations."
4293760,4302720," But your name starts with an N, you know, you are you for real. Honestly, is that the person who is"
4302720,4308800," working? Okay. Yeah, but like if you are going to be completely inflexible and work"
4308800,4314160," and not be helpful or provide solutions or anything, if you're just going to be super,"
4314160,4316880," super hard line on all this kind of stuff, you might as well be an AI."
4316880,4320480," There is no benefit to you being a person. Yeah."
4320480,4326800," It just makes it harder for everybody else. So this is this is to bring it all the way back."
4326800,4333200," This is why I thought what Estonia was doing was cool. I have no idea if they've continued to do"
4333200,4337280," it. Maybe it's gone to trash since then. It's been like at least maybe they're using it to"
4337280,4342080," oppress people. Maybe I have no clue. It's been at least six years since I looked into it,"
4342080,4346400," but it was like really cool when they first started doing it. And I was really annoyed about"
4346400,4351040," some very specific government stuff when I heard they were doing this. So I was like, yeah, it's"
4351040,4358160," awesome. But yeah, they basically employed a bunch of developers doing high skilled tasks"
4358160,4362400," instead of people filing boring paperwork that they probably didn't want to do anyways."
4362400,4366880," And then they exported that started making money from it, saved everyone in the country a ton of"
4366880,4372480," money. Taxes were able to be lowered. They they if I remember, I don't know, I'm going to say a"
4372480,4375440," bunch of stuff that's wrong. So I'm going to stop here, but it was cool. Yeah."
4375440,4382560," Another unrelatable Linus millionaire problem. No, getting stuck at the DMV is literally a meme."
4382560,4390880," It's the most relatable thing ever. It's super relatable. These kinds of systems just"
4390880,4397280," I also so are designed to be inconvenient. Yeah. And nobody likes having their time wasted."
4397920,4406640," Do you do you know? No, no, Jane, Jane also said in chat, I had a similar situation with my current car,"
4406640,4413040," bought from a dealership in Sask while I lived in BC. The dealership couldn't provide satisfactory"
4413040,4419280," evidence that they owned it. I ended up having to see a lawyer to sort it out. I'm so sorry to"
4419280,4428640," hear that, Jaden. Yeah. Yeah. Jaden does pretty well. I don't believe he's a millionaire."
4428640,4434880," But he definitely I mean, it's this is great. Maxis Blitz says so relatable. It was in Zootopia."
4434880,4442960," Yeah, exactly. The sloths in Zootopia. Yeah. Yeah. So funny. Yeah. So funny. Oh, that's like,"
4442960,4448240," I actually really love that movie. That is pretty good. Yeah, this is great. Everyone's piping in"
4448240,4452960," with their stories. Gander Grumlin says three trips to my DMV to get an Illinois license when"
4452960,4457920," moving from Massachusetts. Yeah, 100%. How is that necessary? There's no way that's necessary."
4457920,4461840," How's that even possible? Like, you know, honestly, this is one of the things that really like blows"
4461840,4468720," me away when because here at least getting identification is really painless and easy."
4468720,4475440," But like you'll have to go in physically in in America. You hear people talk about how needing"
4475440,4481440," to present ID is some kind of like voter suppression or whatever else, which I think is wild because"
4481440,4487440," taking a vote without ID is wild. Seems to me. I don't know how it works down there. So I've never"
4487440,4493360," wanted to voice it. So this is the problem. Yeah. The problem is that there are just unbelievable"
4493360,4500400," hoops like they were talking about to get ID in the states in many cases. Yeah. So that's the"
4500400,4504160," issue. So it's one of those problems that shouldn't be. They need to fix that problem."
4504160,4510240," Exactly. Yeah. Exactly. So I don't see why anyone disagrees that you should need to present ID"
4510240,4516080," to do something as important as voting. What we should all agree on is that getting ID should be"
4516080,4524560," the most painless, inexpensive process in the world. Everybody needs identification. What do you"
4524560,4531680," mean? You don't have identification. And if you can't get it or it's hard or it's unaffordable or"
4531680,4536800," whatever else that is a fundamental problem, what does government even exist for? Yeah. If not,"
4536800,4544320," libraries, roads. What's the other one? Schools. Libraries, roads and schools. Well, I guess defense"
4544320,4559680," too. But like for real, that's like fundamental. It's basic. Oh. All right. What else are we going"
4559680,4564880," to talk about? We've got a little off topic today. Sorry. I'm like back on my on my Eostonia thing."
4564880,4569920," They have a whole website just called Eostonia. Okay. We have E identity. So they have ID cards,"
4569920,4576720," mobile IDs, e-residency, smart ID. This is all done. They have all this, all this stuff. They do"
4576720,4581040," e-tax, e-banking, e-business registration. You don't even have to go into register a business."
4581040,4586560," Just do it online. That's amazing. Why would you need to? The amount of crap that you have to get a"
4586560,4592480," lawyer to like do paperwork for you? Why should you need to? It should just be as simple as saying,"
4592480,4596960," yeah, this, this, this and this. Yeah. Wild. And if you already have all of these things"
4597760,4602880," that are digitized, then they already have access to it. Everything's good, right? Like who cares?"
4602880,4608320," E health record, E ambulance, E prescriptions, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, all this different"
4608320,4613040," type of stuff. It's great. I've heard some criticism saying that it wouldn't work as well in very"
4613040,4618080," large countries. Estonia is a very small country. Sure. Doesn't matter for Estonia."
4618080,4622480," And build it better. Yeah. For them, it's great. It doesn't like you can't, you can't use that"
4622480,4627280," criticism against Estonia themselves. And they even recognize they have this thing, the evolution"
4627280,4630720," of digital public service. And the first step is called pain."
4630720,4638320," Lack of money, resources or manpower. And they're like, understanding digitization can"
4638320,4642080," solve, can resolve these issues by increasing accessibility to services."
4642080,4646560," Add support for it, increase it literacy. That's super crazy."
4646560,4650640," Yeah, yeah, yeah. Tech Travis and Twitch chat says, I had my wallet stolen two years ago."
4650640,4655280," I haven't been able to get my ID because my Social Security card was stolen with my wallet."
4655280,4660480," It's a pain in the butt to get ID in the States. The fact that we actually have a similar number"
4660480,4664080," in the States is called a sin number, social insurance number, I think is what it's called."
4664080,4668800," Yeah. So we have a similar, we have a similar system in Canada. The fact that this unchangeable"
4668800,4675360," number that is like a huge security problem, if anyone gets their hands on, and yet you have to"
4675360,4684000," give it to basically f***ing everyone is a system is wild to me. I mean, I had to sign something a"
4684000,4689600," little while ago. Okay. And I'm like, signing it. And I'm like, what does this do? What does this do?"
4689600,4696880," Whoever's going to look at this has no idea who I am. No idea. I mean, the idea of signing"
4696880,4702880," something as validation comes from like small town culture. And everyone knows everyone."
4702880,4708480," We're the bank. We're the banker. The one person who works behind the bank."
4708480,4715760," The banker actually knows what John Hancock's John Hancock is supposed to look like."
4715760,4721360," Anything else is utterly irrelevant. How archaic and broken these systems are."
4721360,4729120," Oh, man. Apparently a sin is not unchangeable in Canada. It's just really hard to do so. Yeah,"
4729120,4734240," there you go. And then immediately you would have to change it constantly because everyone"
4734240,4739200," from your employer to your credit card issuer to your bank is going to need your social"
4739200,4745280," insurance number because it's like so so important and like definitely you were like whatever."
4745280,4749520," Okay, except all these people have it. So"
4749520,4757920," Sorry, I'm having an angry wandshow today. No, it's okay. I'm going to derail us though,"
4757920,4763360," because I almost forgot again, but I was reminded. LTX weekly updates."
4763360,4771120," BOC ticket has been officially updated to do $150. The BOC ticket includes two-day access to the"
4771120,4776640," expo. So unlike pack tickets, I want to make this really clear because I think a lot of people are"
4776640,4782480," used to pack tickets. Unlike pack tickets, you just buy the BOC ticket and it includes"
4782480,4788560," two-day access to the expo. You don't buy access to the expo and the BOC ticket. You just buy the"
4788560,4794560," BOC ticket. Our BOC is overnight. So you could start at 10 a.m. on Saturday and stay in the BOC"
4794560,4802160," area until 6 p.m. on Sunday. We're not saying that we recommend that. But you can, but you could."
4802160,4806800," And somebody probably will. Yeah, your dad probably will."
4808960,4815120," BOC tickets will include a whale land shirt. Sick. That's awesome. Okay. If any creators,"
4815120,4819280," is it the same one or is it new? It's going to be a new whale land shirt. Sweet. Because it's"
4819280,4822960," whale land too. Yeah, it makes sense. The whale land. The whale and creators are interested in"
4822960,4829840," attending reach out to us via info at ltxxpo.com. We'll be sending out invites to creators that"
4829840,4834800," we've worked with in the past and those who we know are interested in attending. I think Paul and Kyle"
4834800,4839760," are already confirmed. I bugged them during their charity stream. I was like, hey, come up. Oh, I"
4839760,4845440," I sent them a bunch of money to hit their target. Oh, nice. I didn't make it a condition that they"
4845440,4849440," had to come to ltx. But I sent it and I was like, Hey, you guys are coming to ltx, right?"
4849440,4853840," They would have come anyway. They would have come anyway. I was just."
4853840,4859680," I sent the money to try to coax them as well. But it wasn't it wasn't that much. It it bumped. But"
4859680,4863520," you know, if any creators are interested in attending reach it. Oh, I already said that bit."
4863520,4869360," Anyone who has already reached out will also get an update with more info on what we can do"
4869360,4876240," to help them get to the expo. Yeah, it's going to be fun. I'm sorry. I'm going back to this."
4876240,4883120," ex Xavier says, I had to use a new credit card. It wasn't signed. The store wouldn't let me use"
4883120,4887760," it because it wasn't signed. I signed it in front of them. Yeah. And they accepted it."
4887760,4897280," Why are we jumping through utterly meaningless hoops? Yeah. That's totally a thing."
4897280,4902000," That's monkey dance. Because technically there is no rule that it has to be signed for like a"
4902000,4907040," certain period of time or you can't see them sign it. So you could like try to use your credit"
4907040,4911760," card for something, not have a pen, buy a pen from them with cash, sign it, and then pay for"
4911760,4915120," something with your credit card. And that's totally fine. It seems legit."
4915120,4921200," Ever since I was a kid, I thought signatures are like a crazy way to do any form of authentication."
4921200,4926160," Yeah. To be clear, we mean with a pen. I know there's other kinds of whatever. But yeah,"
4926160,4931360," it's it's it's wild. The fact that we still rely on that is crazy to me. Anytime I sign"
4931360,4936160," a document that's actually super important and like my signature is in a super important part of it."
4936160,4944000," I'm just like, this is stupid every single time. But it is what it is. Yep. Just got to keep keep"
4944000,4949360," doing the security dance, right? Yeah. It's all working really well. It's a really great theater."
4949360,4957120," Really good. That's a great theater. Yeah. Anyways, speaking of other things that are really great,"
4957120,4964640," AMD says that 110 degrees Celsius on the 7900 XTX is in spec. We will get to that. We should do a"
4964640,4971120," couple of merch messages though. Oh, I could call. And we'll do a couple now. And remind you guys"
4971120,4975040," that if you want to get any merch messages in, it's going to be a pretty good time to get them in"
4975040,4980960," soon. It's already pretty late. I was late today. It's going to be an even later night for me. So,"
4980960,4984320," I don't want the show to drag on forever because I have to go film one more video before I leave"
4984320,4991280," the studio. We're not we're not accepting less than six videos in a week anymore."
4991280,4995360," Does that mean you stay at work until midnight on Fridays? I guess it's a double short week."
4995360,4998560," If it comes to that, it comes to that. But yeah, we've had a couple of short weeks."
4998560,5003600," And what we really need to do is half the writing team is going to CES and half is staying back"
5003600,5008880," here. So, the goal is that it's going to be all CES content every day during the show. And we are"
5008880,5014720," going to be trying to make a video a day back here as well so that the editing team can finally"
5014720,5021760," have a nice buffer and work in a non-frantic style. We've been really struggling to keep up that"
5021760,5026720," buffer lately. So, a little bit more inside information here. Want to hit us with a couple, Dan?"
5026720,5031360," Sure. First one here is from Tyler. Happy New Year. Really excited for the new float plane"
5031360,5036960," look in 2023. Linus' thoughts on adding float plane and LTT store to the video about testing"
5036960,5042960," sponsors customer service. Oh, it's going to be a little late because I don't want to say too much"
5042960,5051040," about that video. There's some... That video is well underway. Also, we know. We know about the"
5051040,5056480," problems. We have quadrupled the size of our customer support team in the last three months."
5056480,5064400," They are working their way through tickets now. Like, we are regularly down. We're coming down."
5064400,5069520," I think we're at about four-day response times, which is utterly unacceptable. But that's where"
5069520,5076800," we're at right now. It's also worth noting that some of the reports you see of how bad things are"
5076800,5083360," are not accurate. I read a tweet today claiming that they had tried to contact us multiple times"
5083360,5087440," and their order never arrived and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. They had tried once and it was"
5087440,5094480," 13 minutes before they tweeted. So, like... That's a bit of a yikes. Sometimes, sometimes what you're"
5094480,5100400," seeing is real. I'm not going to deny that. We've had some problems. We've been too slow. Sometimes,"
5100400,5107280," it's not our fault. You can't have no spam filtering. You literally can't. We can't disable it"
5107280,5112880," completely. And sometimes people's messages do get caught by our spam filter. We do our best to"
5112880,5120240," write it as soon as we manage to find it. And then, other times... You're going to be covered on that."
5120240,5124320," There's technically a way, but it's garbage and you shouldn't do it. Oh, I thought you told me"
5124320,5130000," we couldn't do it. No. Oh. You don't want to go that way, though. Oh, okay. So, maybe that's what"
5130000,5135120," you told me. Maybe. Okay. Well, fine. There. From him. So, I had him in Nick look into it."
5135120,5140480," And then, some of them are just people making things up. Like, legitimately, that happens. And"
5140480,5145360," I'm not going to call out anyone specifically right now, but sometimes people are just... For"
5145360,5149760," whatever reason. Like, I can't fathom people's agenda sometimes, but sometimes people are just"
5149760,5157520," making it up. It is not fair because the volume of tickets aren't even comparable. But"
5157520,5161280," Faux Plains customer support has been killing it. Good job, Joe. Also, Joe has been wearing multiple"
5161280,5166880," hats and trying to help over at Creator Rows. There's genuinely been a really big effort to get that"
5166880,5173200," under control. Yeah. Quadrupling a staff size is like not a simple task. Onboarding all those"
5173200,5178640," people takes time. And that takes time away from the skilled, knowledgeable people that are already"
5178640,5182560," on staff from doing the job of answering tickets. But you're trying to invest in the future, but"
5182560,5187520," people are mad now. And the farther you fall behind now, the more tickets come in. And the"
5187520,5191200," angrier people get. And then the angrier people get, you have more back and forth. So, it takes"
5191200,5194480," more time. And you have so many tickets because you're getting so many orders. And because you have"
5194480,5198320," so many orders, your warehouse gets overloaded. And because they're overloaded, you get more tickets."
5198320,5206480," It's a big brutal cycle, but... It's a first world problem. Yeah. It's a good problem. The"
5206480,5212000," story is killing it. To have as a business. The story is absolutely crushing it. Great job."
5212000,5216640," I mean, you can see there's almost no products on the site with less than a four and a half star"
5216640,5223920," review rating, average review rating. They're amazing. It's an amazing team doing amazing work."
5223920,5228880," But there have been some hiccups this year. And you know what? Some of them were avoidable. I have"
5228880,5234640," to take my share of the blame. I should have pushed harder. I should have paid closer attention."
5235360,5240960," When we started to run into trouble, I should have laid out a path. There's things that I could"
5240960,5247760," have and should have done. But all we can do now is do better. So, that's what we're doing."
5247760,5255920," Okay. I got another one here from Adrian. Alinus and Luke recently had a UPS diet my house and was"
5255920,5260240," wondering what kind of UPS do you use for your critical equipment at LNG? Oh, I don't use UPS"
5260240,5267040," anymore. I prefer FedEx. I'm sorry to hear that you had to witness that at your house."
5267040,5271680," I want to say one thing about the last topic really quick as well. I don't know if we could"
5271680,5277840," do that super legitimately without people saying that there's like inside bias and stuff. If we"
5277840,5282000," tried to evaluate our own customer support. Even if we did it, people would call us liars anyway."
5282000,5287600," That's what I'm saying. I still, I'm interested in it. I'd like to do it. I can tell you now that"
5287600,5293280," the sponsor secret shopping project isn't going to be the last. So, that's absolutely something"
5293280,5301680," that we could do. Wait. No, I pitched it. Pitched what? Secret shopping LTT store. Oh, okay."
5301680,5305920," Yeah. No, I totally blanked on that. Yeah, I pitched it to James. I actually don't know"
5305920,5310400," if they are secret shopping LTT store. I know that the project has started. That was the thing that"
5310400,5317360," I it's going to get called out like. Huh. Okay. I mean, but I mean, it would be fair to call"
5317360,5322320," it. Yeah. Yeah. I don't. I'm not saying you shouldn't do it. I'm just saying people are 100%"
5322320,5329600," going to call it out. All I can say is the customer care team, however many of them there are,"
5329600,5338640," has one directive. Make it right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Sorry. What kind of UPS do you use"
5338640,5345440," for your critical equipment at LMG? We use one from Eaton. Yeah. You have other little ones too,"
5345440,5349680," though, right? Oh, oh, oh, yeah. So the giant UPS that's in the server room. Yes."
5349680,5355120," Is a huge, crazy, epic monster from Eaton. Yeah. But then, yeah, smaller ones all"
5355120,5360880," the proper industrial grade commercial UPS. Yeah. And then the ones. Yeah. The ones that we use for"
5360880,5366560," just everyone's workstations because it's just, man, it's not worth it. Like every UPS is like"
5366560,5374480," $150 or whatever. Like they're not cheap. But if the power goes out and that thing that that person"
5374480,5384800," was working on was worth, I don't know, something you'll thank yourself for having paid for UPSs so"
5384800,5389920," they can save their work and shut down properly. It's so, I can't cannot emphasize the importance"
5389920,5396720," enough. So I believe, hey, Dan, they're APC units. Hey, I believe so. Yeah. APC 1200, 1500s. I don't"
5396720,5407280," know. We buy them in bulk at Costco a lot. Yeah. I think most of the cost is with the batteries"
5407280,5412560," anyway. So if they go bad, do we just take them back to Costco? I'm not going to answer that."
5412560,5421280," I actually don't know. Okay. All right. That's a good idea. Next. Yeah. Okay. What else we got?"
5421280,5426080," We got one from David. Hey, Linus and Luke, heart you both. Quick question regarding cloud"
5426080,5432000," services. It seems that when mentioning a cloud service provider, I've seldom heard a zero as a"
5432000,5438720," reference point in lieu of AWS, Google or even Linode. Any reason or is that just happenstance?"
5438720,5445680," Like from us? Apparently. I never talk about a zero. I can tell you that much. I just don't"
5445680,5451520," really think about them. Yeah. Yeah. Like, have you ever used a zero for anything? Yeah. Oh, okay."
5452880,5460000," There's a long time ago, to be honest, I needed some VM thing that liked worked better through"
5460000,5465760," Azure for some project that was like pre this. Oh, all right. Like long time ago."
5465760,5473840," Since then I haven't, but like flow plane doesn't really use a lot of that stuff anyways."
5473840,5480080," Yeah, we kind of like core design thing. Like the whole idea of vote plane was to not do that. So"
5480080,5485200," like we don't use a lot of that stuff at work. So I don't know. I don't have we talked about"
5485200,5490560," Linode much. I don't know if they're trying to go for a lot. So I mean, we have so we've talked"
5490560,5494800," about them for sure. As you were as in sponsored us. So they might have at one point. Really?"
5494800,5501760," I think so, actually. Surprise. Microsoft has sponsored stuff with us before."
5501760,5513360," Trying to think, didn't they? What is or have they? This is the best way that I can avoid bias"
5513360,5520320," is that I actually just don't know a lot of the time. I don't think it's been a ton. I know."
5520320,5526320," I've talked to someone from Microsoft and basically heard from them that they're not"
5526320,5530800," honestly the biggest fan of doing it. Like sponsoring direct influencers too much."
5530800,5533520," Yeah. I see them do it 100%. Oh, yeah. Definitely."
5533520,5538880," But I know it's like if they really wanted to turn it on, they could like just crush"
5538880,5543200," because they have all this financial backing and they have Xbox. So they have lots of people"
5543200,5545840," interacting with their things all the time and they have Windows. They have lots of people"
5545840,5549600," interacting with their things all the time. Like it would they would be able to just like cover"
5549600,5554480," the internet, but they just they don't for whatever reason. I don't know. Yeah."
5554480,5559040," Yeah, it's a funny thing. So sponsors or ads, Linus doesn't see ads."
5559760,5567680," Yeah. That's a good take. That's funny. Yeah. Yeah. It's it's kind of a funny."
5567680,5572240," It's kind of a funny stance. Like it doesn't really matter what company you are. Like even"
5572240,5578320," we engage in influencer marketing with other influencers because it works like compared to"
5578320,5585680," conventional conventional marketing. It's just it's kind of you got to imagine that it's like some"
5585680,5590880," CMO or like VP level executive there that just is like yeah."
5590880,5594560," Yeah. TV. Yeah. You know or something large event."
5594560,5601840," TV. Microsoft does a lot of like big event sponsorship type of stuff. I don't see them doing a ton of"
5601840,5607600," influencer things or if they do influencer things, I see it more as like an entire takeover, you know."
5607600,5613280," Yeah. Like we're going to send this person to this various country and they're going to"
5613280,5616720," specifically check out our product. Well, it's not a lot of like sponsor"
5616720,5622480," spot type things. Yeah. It just seems kind of silly to take an entire like branch of marketing and"
5622480,5626400," just be like, yeah, we don't like that. But you don't like what like I don't really get what you"
5626400,5632160," mean by that. I agree. I mean, there are some risks. There are risks associated. You have to"
5632160,5636320," actually do do diligence on the people that you're sponsoring and make sure they're not complete"
5636320,5640800," a holes, for example, because that does end up dragging your brand through the mud. Yeah."
5641680,5648480," I mean, that's something. All right. Why don't we, why don't we do some more topics guys? If you"
5648480,5654000," want to get your merch messages in, we just launched new colors of our plaid flannels. We just launched"
5654000,5659200," our new super comfy pajama pants. So those are great things to check out. Also, you know, don't"
5659200,5666160," forget backpacks are shipping now. So there's no backlog for backpacks. I'm just trying to think"
5666160,5671600," if there's anything else to kind of update you guys on. No, sounds good. Oh, yeah. Top"
5671600,5677280," pick. You're going to talk about AMD thinking that 110 degrees. Yes. Pretty chill on the 7900"
5677280,5685440," XTX user reports of AMD's recently released Radeon RX 7900 XTX GPU, commonly hitting hot spot"
5685440,5693040," temperature of 110 degrees Celsius and throttling have been met with dismissal from team red,"
5693040,5699840," at least until it went viral. That's how things tend to go. The first user that we know of to bring"
5699840,5706560," this up attempted to get an RMA from AMD first posted their problems 11 days ago. But on the 26"
5706560,5714640," AMD claimed that 110 degrees was in spec for RDNA three GPUs and the made by AMD cards,"
5714640,5719920," such as the one we reviewed can safely operate at that temperature, a temperature high enough to"
5719920,5726720," boil water and and probably cook things on. More specifically, they said it is the normal"
5726720,5732720," junction temperature in the reviewers guide given to press AMD had a special note on GPU temperature,"
5732720,5737680," specifically mentioning that the card aggressively boosts until reaching the junction temperature"
5737680,5742320," on any of its sensors, but that the product will operate below this temperature under normal"
5742320,5748320," workloads. Anthony notes that this is normal for AMD cards and would be unremarkable. We did not"
5748320,5757040," remark on it. If it only hit 110 rarely, okay, I get what he's saying. If it very rarely happened,"
5757040,5763280," it wouldn't be remarkable. Got it. Since the original complaint, many other users have reported"
5763280,5766960," thermal issues with some taking their cards apart to inspect the thermal interface material."
5766960,5776560," That's going to be a problem. In many cases, it seems the flatness of the cooler may be part of"
5776560,5781200," the problem with obvious contact points and no contact voids visible. That's not good."
5781200,5786240," One user went so far as to attempt to return the card to AMD, but was denied because they had"
5786240,5790480," already opened the box. Okay, so it wasn't even taking the card apart. It was just opening the box."
5790480,5795760," In AMD's defense, this seems to be their distributor digital rivers policy and not theirs."
5795760,5802880," I can tell you right now, a distributor's policy is based on the policy upstream."
5802880,5805840," Yeah, that's like how that works. Yeah, that's not much defense."
5805840,5810720," The policy upstream is, yeah, take it back. We'll deal with it."
5810720,5814560," Then the distributor is more than happy to not have to have someone yell at them on the phone."
5814560,5822240," Yeah. Yeah, that's not a defense. AMD's been having a hard time with the 7900 series so far,"
5822240,5826800," particularly in respect to power and thermals, which they appear to have known about prior to"
5826800,5833280," launch. In particular, the cards released so far have locked power play tables, a popular method"
5833280,5838320," for overclocking Radeon GPUs, which means that overclocked potential is much more limited than"
5838320,5843600," previous generations. This coincides with our testing where we noted very strange power consumption"
5843600,5848000," figures and an apparent inability for the card to effectively throttle itself."
5848000,5854320," Power color, Steven, a rep for one of AMD's board partners, I wonder which one, has chimed in"
5854320,5859280," asking everyone to send reports of high thermals to him regardless of board vendor."
5859280,5863840," Cool. To help collect data and provide evidence to AMD that there is in fact a problem. That's"
5863840,5870560," cool. Help them out if you have evidence. AMD has since recognized that there are thermal"
5870560,5876160," throttling issues at the 7900 XTX and recommend users contact them directly. And maybe Steven,"
5876160,5882720," maybe do both. The user with the opened and non-refundable Radeon is now being offered that refund."
5884080,5892560," But AMD still won't pay for shipping. Got him. What is the correct way of addressing a problem"
5892560,5898720," like this and how is AMD missing the mark if they are? I mean, the correct way of addressing it is to"
5898720,5906880," basically stop blaming the user for one thing. If a card that is completely assembled and shipped"
5906880,5913680," to a user as a single unit and it just goes into place is seeing these kinds of temperatures,"
5913680,5918560," especially if they knew that this was a problem prior to launch. I just don't really understand why"
5918560,5924320," nobody was primed on it and why they didn't have some idea that this was going to happen."
5924320,5928480," At the same time though, at 110 degrees, I wonder if you're getting it. I mean,"
5928480,5932720," you're not supposed to stick your hand in your computer, but I wonder if there's safety concerns."
5932720,5938000," No, because that's the junction temperature. That's not what the actual heat is."
5938000,5942240," This is what I'm kind of, oh yeah, fair enough. This is what I'm kind of getting at though. If it's"
5942240,5946960," rarely, and if it's only at specific spots, if it's not overall temperature, stuff like that,"
5946960,5953200," and it is in spec, is this a problem? Is this much of a problem?"
5953200,5958800," Well, it depends how rare rarely is. Yeah, it's a problem if the thermal compound is not contacting"
5958800,5964080," properly. That was the scariest part of the article for me. Yeah. The void zones. That's a little"
5964080,5971040," sketch. Yeah, that's that's super sketch. I mean, these dies are packed so densely with transistors."
5971040,5974720," You can't just have a spot that isn't being cooled. No, that's super bad."
5974720,5980240," Or it's super bad. Air is an excellent insulator. And so if you have an air bubble above just one"
5980240,5985200," part of this die, even if it doesn't, even if it doesn't cause a problem immediately,"
5985200,5990320," there's a very good chance it could in the long term. Especially if it's not throttling itself"
5990320,5992240," properly, which was also noted. Yes."
5996640,6003120," Was the correct way of addressing this problem? I mean, I would say it should be probably through"
6003120,6006960," their partners since that's where the boards are going to be shipping through. There's no more built"
6006960,6011840," by AMD. I'll say to you. There's no more built by AMD cards anymore. So the way they should be"
6011840,6017520," addressing it again is if partners are afraid that if they take cards back, they're not going to get"
6017520,6023440," compensation for them, then that's going to be reflected in their policies. So the policy needs"
6023440,6028160," to be that they need to support their partners. I mean,"
6028160,6033760," Probably offer that guy free shipping. Both AMD and Nvidia have been guilty of not supporting"
6033760,6039360," partners properly than blaming partners when there's bad customer service."
6039360,6047200," And this is why when people try to like fanboy for AMD and act like they're like"
6047200,6050960," perfect, squeaky clean and we're like, man, like we want them to do well."
6050960,6053840," Yeah, we really do for real genuinely really do."
6053840,6058960," But you can support and not be a fanboy that is entirely possible."
6058960,6062560," Yeah, exactly. You can cheer something on and not be a fanboy."
6062560,6068400," And still and still see the challenges. Yeah. Right. Like, you know, I made a whole video."
6068400,6072880," I love Intel, right? Why I still love Intel, I think was the title of the video. That doesn't"
6072880,6077040," mean that they don't have a lot of problems. And that's what the video was about. And it's the same"
6077040,6084320," for AMD. I still love AMD, but they've got a lot of problems, right? And that's the thing. I mean,"
6084320,6091040," anytime, anytime there's a human element, right? It's going to be amazing. But"
6091040,6095040," there's going to be some amazing screw ups, you know?"
6095040,6103360," That's that's the that's the magic of being human. So we just have to, and it's not wrong to"
6103360,6110800," recognize that. Yeah. It's fine to air as human, right? You just got to you got to fix it after."
6110800,6114640," So yeah, they should they should probably cover shipping for the guy if the card is defective,"
6114640,6122160," right? It's it's wild to me that in the tech industry, it has been normalized to pay for"
6122160,6127920," return shipping on a defective item. If you want to return something, you're paying the shipping."
6127920,6135120," Like no one's going to eat that for you. But this thing is broken. What? That's not on me."
6135120,6140560," Yeah. I mean, you should be compensating me for the time it takes to put it back in a box"
6140560,6147040," and like drop it off for you. Yeah. No, you should be booking a courier to come at my convenience"
6147040,6153440," and pick it up. Like, I don't I don't get it. Don't don't ship broken stuff. But that I mean,"
6153440,6158160," that's the thing. That's the race to zero, right? Is and like to be clear, we've talked about this"
6158160,6165120," extensively in the past. I understand why there's no margin in this industry. If they actually"
6165120,6170880," offered the kind of service that I think is correct, they'd go out of business and then there"
6170880,6176480," would be no tech. You would not buy them until someone who has worse policies and can stay in"
6176480,6180400," business stays in business and you'll buy from them because ultimately you're still going to want"
6180400,6185680," a new GPU. And that's why that's why we take it. That's why we lie down and take it."
6185680,6197760," There's a rapid fire topic. LTT float plane exclusive, the star forage info is up on LMG"
6197760,6203200," clips for 48 hours only. Apparently, there is a link to this video in the WAN show description."
6203200,6208160," This is some behind the scenes content that you can find on our Linus Tech Tips float plane"
6208160,6212320," account or Linus Tech Tips float plane page. Sign up for float plane for as little as five bucks"
6212320,6219440," a month or 50 bucks a year at floatplane.com/linustechtips or LTT. There's so many good exclusives on"
6219440,6225440," float plane. I think the policy now is we shouldn't go three days without a new exclusive, whether it's"
6225440,6231920," behind the scenes or like an ask the team or extra like cutting room floor or anything like that."
6232800,6238320," And yeah, just don't I would highly suggest adding the slash LTT on the end because then you just go"
6238320,6243200," directly to the account. You don't have to go to the front page. Yeah, I know our front page is bad."
6243200,6252240," We'll fix it. Moving on more topics. Should we talk about the most exciting thing ever?"
6252240,6257680," A graphics card leak? I guess. I wonder what graphics card hasn't been leaked in the last while."
6258400,6263200," NVIDIA leaks their own card. Wait, you mean all the previous leaks weren't also directly from the"
6263200,6274320," companies? Well, no, in a lot of cases. NVIDIA in particular is pretty... I believe that if an"
6274320,6282080," NVIDIA leak happens, it is probably not intentional. Okay. Like pretty much every one of their cards"
6282080,6285680," gets leaked though. Well, yeah, that's because they're working with a whole bunch of partners"
6285680,6291680," all over the world. And they eventually have to tell them something. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So..."
6291680,6300960," When show behind the scenes, full plane exclusive, please. It's not that interesting. Oh, yeah, no."
6300960,6305120," I mean, if you're on full plane, you get the pre-show, which is kind of a behind the scenes,"
6305120,6308320," like when we're setting up and talking about topics and stuff, sometimes it's very short,"
6308320,6312880," like a minute. And we're just like, okay, let's go. And then other times we kind of shoot the breeze"
6312880,6316720," for... We could maybe have Dan like shoot a thing about the setup that's back there."
6316720,6320800," Yeah, that would be a pretty good full plane exclusive. Yeah. Now that it works."
6320800,6325920," I think they did a short about it. Good day. Oh, okay. That's cool. Sweet."
6325920,6333040," Anyways, yeah. NVIDIA leaks their own card, RTX 4070 Ti. NVIDIA Omniverse, in quotes,"
6333040,6340080," the platform for creating and operating metaverse applications. Sick. Leaked the 4070 Ti confirmation."
6340080,6345760," They were quick to retract the info, but here's a screenshot from the Omniverse article."
6345760,6346800," Want to show it? I do."
6346800,6355360," There we go. Wow. Nice. This all but confirms that NVIDIA has simply rebadged the 4080 12"
6355360,6361920," gig as the 4070 Ti. Nice. Same memory size, same boost clock, same CUDA core count."
6361920,6368560," And there's a link to the tech power up 4080 page. There are also rumors of a slight price drop,"
6368560,6377360," originally 899 for the 4080 12 gig. Now 799, potentially not sure. This is still a $200 price jump"
6377360,6384640," from the 3070 Ti, which had an MSRP of 599. So it's still bad. Overall, people don't seem excited"
6384640,6389680," about the current price of modern hardware with good reason. Desktop GPU sales have reached their"
6389680,6395040," lowest point since 2005. Great video title. That would be overall. Overall, people don't seem"
6395040,6400240," excited about the current price of computer hardware or the current price of anything,"
6400240,6404480," because companies are just looting people and it's horrific. Micron has seen"
6404480,6412480," demand drop so much that they've cut 10% of their workforce. Intel reported a 15% decline in sales"
6412480,6420320," and a 59% drop in overall profits for Q3 2022 compared to Q3 2021. Yikes."
6421840,6425920," I do think there was a bit of a spike in purchasing when COVID happened because people needed to"
6425920,6430560," boost their home offices. And now we're probably dealing with the trail off of that, which makes"
6430560,6436720," sense. More information should be available at CES next week that totally makes sense. Watch"
6436720,6442240," the channel. There's going to be a bunch of videos discussion question. Why did the 90 tier"
6442240,6448480," basically stay the same price? Because it was already overpriced. But 780 have increased so much."
6448480,6453760," It's 50 because they were less overpriced level and it's 60 the new 70 for mid-range gamers."
6453760,6460240," I mean, it's pretty simple. Basically, what we're seeing is that in video observed during the"
6460240,6469360," most recent crypto craze, that people were willing to pay this new amount and they are being the"
6469360,6475120," market leader. They essentially set the price for what a GPU costs. And this is why we were so upset"
6475120,6480000," when people were happy to pay that. Because as a business, as much as we can rag on a video,"
6480000,6488080," which is a lot, as a business, this is what you're supposed to do. It sucks. It sucks. But every"
6488080,6493360," business school in the world will tell you to do this. What the market will bear. Yeah. And so"
6493360,6499840," like literally like lesson one of the whole program. And so what gamers, I mean, it basically"
6499840,6505680," operates exactly the same way as the current housing bubble that's taking place in BC."
6505680,6514400," Like instead of the calculus for affording a home is supposed to be based on how much income"
6514400,6521120," versus how much the price is so that you can live in it. But as people have started treating real"
6521120,6527040," estate as a speculative investment and as people have turned that speculative investment into more"
6527040,6532800," than just a speculative investment, hoping that it will go up in value, but also a like a regular"
6532800,6541120," revenue investment through either leasing to other people directly or in particular through Airbnb,"
6541120,6546640," the calculus has changed a lot. So now people who just want a place to live have to bid against"
6546640,6552720," people who want to rent it and just have free cashflow to acquire these properties and can"
6552720,6558640," afford to wait for a return, maybe in five or 10 or 20 years, and they have to bid against people"
6558640,6566320," who are renting it short term, which can generate just unbelievable returns. I mean, that's what"
6566320,6571680," the calculation is based on. I wish I could find it. I read this amazing article that was basically"
6571680,6576320," like the average price for a home will be like $5 million. I don't remember what exactly the number"
6576320,6583120," was, but like this astronomical number by this year, not very far from now. And here's the math"
6583120,6588000," to prove it. If anybody has this article, please, please post it in the chat because I want there's"
6588000,6592400," been a handful of people I've wanted to show it to because it was really amazing. It opened my eyes"
6592400,6599920," because I realized that it's not because there's not enough houses. It's certainly not because people"
6599920,6607520," are making more money. It's because the commoditization of housing and the way that it's transitioned from"
6607520,6615280," being a place for people to live, a basic necessity to this vehicle for investment dollars has changed"
6615280,6620560," the way we calculate how much it's worth. So the worth of a house is no longer based on what a person"
6620560,6627120," can afford. The worth of a house is based on how much a landlord can extract or based on how much"
6627120,6633520," a in particular short-term landlord can extract from multiple short-term tenants. And if you look at"
6633520,6640480," the numbers, the amount of money that people charge for an Airbnb, assuming they can get even 75%,"
6640480,6646640," like what would it be like a fill rate or like, I don't even know what term to use for it, but"
6646640,6655120," 75% occupancy or something like that. It's mind-blowing, right? And so how can you possibly bid against"
6655120,6660480," that if they can just use their money to make money, then the price goes up proportional to"
6660480,6665520," how much they can charge for it. And that's never going to be attainable for just like normal"
6665520,6669040," people working normal jobs trying to buy a house. I understand where you're coming from."
6669040,6675600," Fan Stan, somebody said nobody's home in BC is a basic necessity. That's just not true,"
6675600,6679600," but I understand where you're coming from. People still need places. Yeah, people like,"
6680160,6686080," by that logic, no food in California is a basic necessity because they could go get food somewhere"
6686080,6692880," else. There is lots of basic housing. That's a brain dead take. Sorry, bro. I shouldn't"
6692880,6700480," point you out the line is, I'm sorry, brother. I think I get where he's coming from because he's"
6700480,6705120," saying it's all investments, basically. And to a certain degree, even if you didn't intend it to"
6705120,6709520," be investment, it is now. But there's a lot that can be done to present that. But you still have to"
6709520,6714480," have a place to live. Yes, for sure. There's a lot that can be done to prevent that. And it could go"
6714480,6720320," back that way. I don't have exactly the right solution. Anyone claiming to have a perfect solution"
6720320,6730400," is probably to lunch, probably either a liar or an idiot. But like, there's obvious, there's low"
6730400,6736320," hanging fruit that could improve the situation. So anyway, it's pretty much the same thing that"
6736320,6745200," happened with GPUs. Instead of weighing the personal satisfaction, the value of enjoying gaming"
6745200,6750640," against the number of hours that you had to work doing something, presumably it isn't your favorite"
6750640,6760080," thing to do to attain it is no longer the primary driver of GPU pricing. The primary driver of GPU"
6760080,6766240," pricing became how much money you could earn with it over a prolonged period of time for people"
6766240,6774880," who had money to invest. And so NVIDIA enjoyed that shift and is now trying to maintain that"
6774880,6780800," momentum for as long as possible. And AMD is absolutely playing along. $1,000 GPU is still"
6780800,6787520," unbelievable. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. It's way out of line with inflation. And inflation is out of line"
6787520,6792640," with what inflation should be. I mean, you need to look no further than the record profits of our"
6792640,6800080," local friendly grocery. Oh, yeah. So sorry, we have to increase the prices on these various"
6800080,6805280," goods at the grocery store. It's all inflation. It's cousin inflation. By the way, 60% higher"
6805280,6809520," peak profit than we've ever had in history. Yeah, whatever that came from. It was inflation,"
6809520,6816960," though. Yeah. It's just so cool. Groceries are so expensive. It's actually crazy."
6817840,6826960," Yeah, water would be good. But what I'd rather have is some merch messages."
6826960,6829920," All right, let's get you some merch messages. Thank you."
6829920,6836720," Okay, this one's from Brandon. Do any of you have New Year's resolutions or do you have"
6836720,6842160," resolution on any of the businesses? Is there something you are looking forward to in the New Year?"
6842160,6847760," I've never done New Year's resolutions. January 1 is just a day to me. Yeah."
6847760,6854320," You can form resolutions at any day out of the year. You can decide you're going to improve"
6854320,6860400," yourself 365 days a year. I think your December 30 resolution should be to not put things off"
6860400,6866640," until some arbitrary bullsh*t. That's a good resolution. Yeah, that's the best resolution."
6866640,6871760," I like it. I miss all my goals January 1 and then have to wait another year. It's"
6871760,6878000," perfect. This one's from William. Hey, guys. Love the show. Do you guys have any little hacks,"
6878000,6882800," scripts or automations that you find make your life or workflow better?"
6882800,6894160," Yeah. Hiring people? That's a hack. That's a good one. Yeah, we have tons at Flowplane."
6895760,6902240," We finally actually handed it. Oh, I have to give them the update. We have the update for it. But"
6902240,6907280," the whisper thing, I'll leave about that. That's like more or less done now."
6907280,6913840," So it taps into OpenAI Whisper. Oh, yeah. It's just like an easy way to do it."
6913840,6917040," So now instead of needing to install the dependencies and all that kind of stuff,"
6917040,6921440," you just run an executable. It throws some temporary files around and handles all that for you."
6921440,6927280," And then you can either select file, press a button that says select file and a file prompt opens up,"
6927280,6932000," or you just drag and drop things on top of it. And it can queue a bunch and then queue all the"
6932000,6937280," tasks and go through all of them. And it automatically deposits the script file and the root folder for"
6937280,6941920," where the video came from, regardless of where it came from. And you could queue up like a bunch of"
6941920,6945440," videos all at once and it'll just chug through all the tasks. That's super cool. It has dropped"
6945440,6949120," down menus for all the different settings and stuff. I mean, his basically entire job. Oh,"
6949120,6951280," you know what? Why don't you do your eyes thing?"
6951280,6960080," What? The eyes thing that you were so proud of?"
6960080,6968960," I have no eyes. Slack? Oh, okay. The eyes thing is cool."
6968960,6975760," There's so he's still on the thing. So I won't say the name, but there's some this was collaborative,"
6975760,6982320," but notifications and Slack suck notifications and team suck notifications in everything sucks."
6982320,6986480," Yeah, boo notifications. I use that on my notifications. Please use to be super mad at"
6986480,6992960," specific applications for this. And now I just I'm not mad at specific applications. I'm just"
6992960,7000000," mad at everything notifications in the modern era are just rough. It seems like I will definitely,"
7000640,7007040," for sure, get notifications for things that I don't care about. Yeah. And I will often not get"
7007040,7012640," notifications for things at all or get notifications like days down the line. I got a notification from"
7012640,7019920," teams. I think I might have shown you this. It was like over 170 days old. It came up on my thing"
7019920,7026880," and it said like 170 whatever D and I was like, what is that? And I clicked on it and it like"
7026880,7030960," scrolled all the way up and got me back to the message and I was like, bro,"
7030960,7038960," the entire reason why this application is important is because it needs to notify me of"
7038960,7044560," important work communications. That is like the core thing that I needed to do. And it just"
7044560,7050880," fails at it. And so to slack, I'm not singling out teams. So we have this thing now where both"
7051760,7058000," like the float plane specific team and the labs web specific team, both of them are doing this"
7058000,7064880," thing where when they do standups or sorry, not when they do standups, when you like post a thing"
7064880,7071120," for code review, you the person that you're tagging that should be reviewing it reacts to it with"
7071120,7076800," eyes when they've seen it. You don't have to rely on notifications anymore. And then everyone in"
7076800,7080480," their profile on slack, if you click on them, you can see their phone number. So if they don't"
7080480,7085520," react to it, you can it's not it's not even a rude thing, right? I think honestly, a year ago,"
7085520,7089360," if someone texted me and was like, Hey, you haven't looked at whatever yet, I would have"
7089360,7096400," probably been like, that's a little like, give me a sec, do whatever. Now, no, not rude anymore,"
7096400,7101520," because you probably didn't get notified. It probably didn't work. I'll be at my computer,"
7101520,7106720," focused, working on stuff. And I'll get a text message from the main one it happens from for me,"
7106720,7111280," the person that actually popularized it might be watching right now is Jaden. By the way,"
7111280,7115120," did you see this come through? Because he will have worked on something for a while, and I need to"
7115120,7119680," roll it out on the app store or something. I have no idea he sent me the message out. My phone hasn't"
7119680,7124560," gone off. I haven't gone on a desktop notification. Slack isn't blinking. Nothing's happening. There's"
7124560,7129760," no reason for me to read this. I'm just working on whatever. And then he texts me and I'm like, Oh,"
7129760,7136000," good. Now I know I will open up slack to the channel that doesn't even highlight it. It doesn't even"
7136000,7140880," say that there's a message there. I click on it and yup, there's his whole nicely written out prepared"
7140880,7145920," thing for it. It's like, Oh my God. So yeah, if if the person doesn't react with eyes,"
7145920,7151120," you can just text them. And then eventually they'll see it, they'll react with eyes. Now you know,"
7151120,7156400," for sure, because read receipts, if they exist, they don't exist in slack, as far as I know,"
7156400,7160800," maybe you can get that on for it. But if they exist are also not reliable. Yeah, because what"
7160800,7165600," if the person just had the window open? Yeah, they might not know it came in. So now you react"
7165600,7173600," specifically that way. And you know, it's good. And I mean, Luke's at the point now where compared"
7173600,7178960," to 18 months ago, I'd say you're managing what about three times more people? It's probably somewhere"
7178960,7185280," around there. Yeah, and maybe not necessarily like managing, but certainly getting need reporting"
7185280,7193120," from like someone else who's realistically their actual like manager, who actually gives them tasks"
7193120,7200960," to work on that to but Luke is the Luke is the only person in like executive management here"
7200960,7208320," who can look at code and have any idea what the crap it is. Like, is this spaghetti or is this"
7210640,7218400," one thing that I will say is, yeah, our development team is really strong. So it helps when like,"
7218400,7225520," I'll say the labs local team, all of them are it's it's three developers. There are other people"
7225520,7228800," that do development on the labs local team, but I'm talking about three specific ones. I don't know"
7228800,7233120," who's off probation who isn't. So I'm just not going to say any names. Well, Jake is clearly"
7233120,7238160," off probation, but I'm not I think Nick is as well then. I'm not sure about the last one. So I'm not"
7238160,7245760," going to say that person's name. But they're all like super good. So I can be pretty hands off with"
7245760,7249440," them realistically. I mostly just like want to know what they're working on so I can make sure"
7249440,7252800," that if there's any blocks that I can remove or if they need to connect with someone else in the"
7252800,7256640," team, I can make sure that happens or whatever like I'm mostly trying to be a support structure"
7256640,7262480," for them because they're just like killing it. Oh, yeah, someone in chat said, love it. I do eyes"
7262480,7268480," and then green check mark when done. You guessed the green check mark part because we do that too."
7268480,7275360," It's great. It's great. I yeah, it's fantastic. Nice. Want to hit us with some more merge messages?"
7275360,7281680," Sure. I've gone here from an anonymous user. Would you be at all interested in touring a fiber ISP?"
7281680,7288560," I mean, what ISP would not have fiber optics? If you don't have any fiber optics and you're an"
7288560,7294000," ISP, you're a pretty tear. I think I would be more interested in touring a non fiber ISP. Yeah."
7294000,7300640," We have rope. We like vibrated at a certain frequency to send data packets."
7300640,7307360," For real though, yeah, I'd be pretty interested in touring an ISP. Depends what you mean by ISP."
7307360,7312800," ISPs have a lot of different show. Yeah, have a lot of different facilities. I can tell you right now,"
7312800,7318160," you're not going to get me out of bed for just like a cursory high level thing. If I don't get to"
7318160,7327120," actually poke and prod at things, I'm not going to go. And that's not me just like being an ass"
7327120,7334720," about it. That's me recognizing what the viewers expect from LTT and wanting to deliver that. So,"
7334720,7339040," it's kind of like what I said to Micron. It's like, yeah, sponsorship aside. I don't care."
7339040,7344080," Pay me, don't pay me. We're not even having a conversation if I'm not building my own ramp."
7344800,7348400," Because and there's so much feedback on that video. This is the best video you've ever done."
7348400,7352480," This is the best factory tour ever. This is fantastic. I've seen it now. That's great."
7352480,7359200," Because that's where I draw my line in the sand. Does that make me a little difficult to deal with?"
7359200,7366320," Sure. But not for you guys, right? For you guys, it's great. Because if I'm, you know, a hard"
7366320,7371040," nose negotiator with these companies that are offering tours or whatever else, then ultimately,"
7371040,7378160," that's a benefit for all of us because we get a way deeper look. So in response, yeah, I'm interested,"
7378160,7382880," but don't waste my time. Don't waste and by that, I mean, don't waste our viewers time."
7382880,7389920," So if you guys have actual like high level approval, so we don't have to go in and like,"
7389920,7393840," \"No, you can't go in that room. Oh, you have to blur that,\" or whatever. Yeah, sure. Let's talk."
7393840,7400000," Yeah, I'm interested there. Yeah, that would be pretty exciting. Good. Another one here from Mark."
7400000,7403920," Hey, Linus and Luke, I'll be attending CES for the first time next week."
7403920,7408880," Anything you wish you knew before your first CES and or advice for a first time attendee on how"
7408880,7414560," to make the most of the event, I guess, is really big. Like the strip, you know, you look at it on"
7414560,7421280," a map and it's like, \"Oh, it's just like a few hotels.\" I walked everywhere my first year. It's"
7421280,7426960," mostly, it's most, I think part of it is in effect because they really oppress being able to walk"
7426960,7432800," anywhere reasonably. I almost died. I wouldn't try to walk everywhere. If you can afford it,"
7432800,7438720," take cars. It's not designed for you to be able to walk around very efficiently. If you don't know"
7438720,7442640," the like really weird routes that feel like you're doing something you shouldn't be doing."
7442640,7450320," I am very anti-tipping culture. I think people should just be paid properly to be clear. I tip"
7450320,7455760," because I know they're not paid properly, but I'm very anti-tipping culture in general."
7456720,7464320," But even though I'm anti-tipping culture, I would say in Las Vegas, okay, so here I will tip"
7464320,7469600," just because I know people aren't paid properly. In Las Vegas, I tip to make sure that people don't"
7469600,7476240," harm me and my stuff. They're really aggressive. I didn't tip enough. I did tip, but I didn't tip"
7476240,7480400," satisfactorily to some cabbie and he literally took my luggage out of the back of the car and threw"
7480400,7486560," it on the ground. If I never had to go to Las Vegas again, I wouldn't."
7486560,7491920," Yeah, if you're not into the things that Las Vegas is made for,"
7491920,7497520," it's not great. I don't like Las Vegas at all."
7497520,7503440," If you're not going to a specific place that's not going to a specific place,"
7503440,7508480," I would use the monorail as much as possible to get to and from the convention center at least."
7508480,7514480," Yeah. It's possible the first year I went, I stayed at Excalibur, which I didn't know was a bad"
7514480,7521360," hotel or something. Honestly, to me even now, they all smell like crap because they allow smoking"
7521360,7526000," on the casino floor. And they just dump perfume to try to cover it up."
7526000,7532160," To cover it up so that it doesn't really. Yeah, they all smell awful. They're all, I mean,"
7533120,7538560," theoretically, I guess, like, oh, there'll be like a class of clientele here or there,"
7538560,7542400," whatever in practice, everyone just goes and gambles at whatever hotel they feel like going"
7542400,7548160," to. Like anyone can walk into any of them. So it's like the imaginary lines that they draw"
7548160,7551840," between like the good hotels and the bad hotel. I don't really get it personally."
7551840,7556800," But anyway, I stayed at Excalibur not realizing that it's like a bad one or something. And"
7556800,7562160," I will say it's inconvenient to get anywhere from Excalibur because it's like way down at the"
7562160,7565840," end of the strip. So I wasn't really able to take the monorail anywhere. But if you can,"
7565840,7571040," stay somewhere with easy monorail access because that's by far the fastest, most affordable way"
7571040,7576560," to get around. Definitely most affordable. Because during CES, while getting around in a car is"
7576560,7581120," is probably a better way to go than walking depending on where you need to walk."
7581120,7589760," It's going to be slow because everyone else is doing that too. Yeah. Okay, I've got another one"
7589760,7595680," here. Do you guys think wired mainstream earbuds will forever be an extinct species or might they"
7595680,7602240," return? My AirPods desinking from my Z Fold 3 in my pocket is close to giving me an aneurysm."
7602240,7608320," And every USB-C to 3.5mm adapter is horrible in some way. It's annoying that that's true."
7608320,7615600," Yeah. I think it's over. I think Wired Headphone Party is definitely over."
7616560,7620080," I mean, I've seen that it's becoming trendy to use Wired Headphones again."
7620080,7625360," But I don't see that becoming the norm again. I don't think Apple's going to release a new"
7625360,7632080," iPhone with a 3.5mm jack. It's not happening. Yeah. And what Apple does so does the rest of"
7632080,7639040," the industry. Yeah, hopefully those adapters get better. Yes. Sec IT guy says you should stay at"
7639040,7643200," the ARIA. It's smoke free and segmented from everywhere else. Also has monorail access."
7643200,7648880," That's where we stayed our first year as Linus Media Group. It's also adults only if I recall"
7648880,7654400," correctly. We did it a few times. The reason we did it though was actually because it had the fastest"
7654400,7660560," internet on the strip. And that's no longer the case. It seems like the one company that deals"
7660560,7666240," with everyone's internet now deals with ARIA as well. And the last time we stayed there."
7668800,7673120," Excuse me. The internet was just as slow as everywhere else. So we paid extra for no reason."
7673120,7677520," That sucks. Okay, I could use some water then. I'm going to take you up on that. Okay, sense."
7677520,7682960," Do you want me to read merch messages? Just like a lingering... I've had this car for like"
7682960,7687920," nine days. Do you want me to go over another topic so you can take a break? Anything's fine. Just"
7687920,7692320," something. Dying. I'm looking for another topic."
7698080,7710080," I'm fine. Okay. Oh, that was better. Oh, this is unfortunate. Pixel 7 users complain of camera..."
7710080,7713600," How is this suddenly happening? Pixel 7's been out for a bit, hasn't it?"
7713600,7720640," Pixel 7 users complain of camera glass spontaneously cracking just as MKBHD crowns it phone of the year."
7720640,7726400," 7 Pro users also affected. How long has it been out? Hasn't been out for like a while?"
7726400,7730400," Yeah, it's been out for a few months. Users on Reddit, Twitter, there's even a hashtag,"
7730400,7734480," and Google's forums have reported that the back camera glass on their Pixel 7 or Pixel 7 pro"
7734480,7740400," phones has just spontaneously cracked leaving a hole over the camera lens. It's currently unclear"
7740400,7744480," what's causing the issue. Some users are reporting it occurring when the phone was in a case."
7744480,7750000," Others suspect it may be due to cold weather or accidental bumps. Most, if not all of these"
7750000,7755200," phones have had their camera glass break in identical spots though directly over either the"
7755200,7762000," wide lens camera or the ultra wide lens camera. I mean, well, you know that some types of glass"
7762000,7766160," can even have inherent tension, right? Like tempered glass. Man, if you ever want to go down"
7766160,7770240," a rabbit hole, learn about tempered glass. It's super cool. Spontaneous combustion of like glass"
7770240,7775360," doors and stuff. Did that happen to us? Yeah, that happened on when back when part of the editing"
7775360,7780320," den used to be called the library that that huge tempered glass door we had just as boom"
7780320,7785280," shattered in the middle of the night. Yeah, crazy. Google has not yet made an official public comment"
7785280,7789680," on the issue but has assured at least one customer that not only are they aware of it,"
7789680,7793840," but after the engineers deliberated, Google decided not to cover it under warranty."
7793840,7799920," Some users have gotten phone replacements from Google support while others have been told they"
7799920,7806080," need to spend hundreds of dollars, 200 at least 400 for some to replace the entire back panel."
7806080,7812400," This is the problem with that right to repair bill getting neutered. Yeah. Oh, well, you can"
7812400,7815840," repair it, but you'll have to buy an assembly. Are you sure you wouldn't rather just have a whole"
7815840,7822000," new device? That's the whole problem with the current situation. A similar issue occurred with"
7822000,7826960," the displays of Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 pro phones with Google blaming owners even telling one"
7826960,7833280," customer screens don't crack. That's a good one. That's nice."
7833280,7843360," Our discussion question is who wrote this? Okay. What does it say about a company when two children"
7843360,7847760," in a trench coat trying to sneak into an R rated movie could do a better job at public relations?"
7847760,7855600," I mean, if they can get away with it, they're going to do it. This is why that right to repair"
7855600,7860640," bill needs to be better. That's it. Because this is like clearly BS. Yeah."
7860640,7867920," If it's an issue with the device and they know it's an issue with the device, how is it not covered?"
7867920,7875120," That's actually crazy. Speaking of issues, what does lifetime even mean?"
7875120,7883440," Phil Mora says no more to lifetime licenses. I like that nice little touch on the title Adam."
7883440,7889520," This is written up by Adam. Software company Wondershare recently launched the newest version"
7889520,7895280," of their video editing software, Filmora 12. And alongside it, they brought another new feature"
7895280,7904320," that lifetime license users now get to pay. I have never heard of Filmora."
7904320,7910880," To be fair and neither by. But you two bird Daniel Batal has. And he noted he noticed when he tried"
7910880,7915520," to log into the new version of the software, who's prompted to pay for a license to use the new"
7915520,7921200," software, despite having a lifetime license that promised all software updates are completely free"
7921200,7929040," on the product page. This sounds a lot like, Hey, it's only local storage. This page has now been"
7929040,7937280," deleted, but can still be viewed via archive.org. Just dunking on people again. Actually,"
7937280,7942800," amazing. Batal, whose channel provided numerous tutorial videos for the software,"
7942800,7947360," reached out to the company. They replied that to provide competitive pricing,"
7947360,7953680," we provide a big discount for non subscription plan holders who want to upgrade. It only costs"
7953680,7964480," $29.99 to upgrade with free access to effects and plugins worth $20.99. Okay. And noted that"
7964480,7970720," many companies do not even offer a perpetual license. That is literally not an argument."
7970720,7978160," Because you do. Got him. They also asked to do another sponsorship with Batal."
7978160,7984000," I hope this goes the direction I think it's going to. Batal's major issues is that the company no"
7984000,7988640," longer is providing updates for the software. Makes sense. Their new perpetual license is much"
7988640,7993840," worse, providing only updates for Filmora 12 and no updates to future versions of the software."
7993840,7999360," I'm going to add in a little bit thing here, despite claiming that they would, right? Because like,"
7999360,8003360," you could buy a perpetual license to a version of a software and they could update and then it's"
8003360,8007920," annoying, but it is what it is. But they said that you would get new versions. So that's the bigger"
8007920,8014640," problem. Any in emails to Batal, the company clarified that they are calling new versions of"
8014640,8024320," software upgrades instead of updates. And that their license agreement only covered updates."
8024320,8030800," Wow. That is the dooshiest thing ever. I don't know if that word isn't that bad, right?"
8030800,8035680," I'm pretty sure you can say doosh. Yeah. Okay. Cool. Wow. That's horrible. Furthermore,"
8035680,8042320," the web page used to state that lifetime users of Filmora 9 or earlier would receive a free upgrade."
8043040,8050880," Oh, that's funny, but the page was removed a couple of weeks ago. Hopefully that one's covered"
8050880,8055360," under archive.org as well, because if it is, then update and upgrade are both stated and they're"
8055360,8060720," just liars. Discussion question. In other markets, certain technologies protected terminology is"
8060720,8065360," protected, but tech remains a wild West for advertisers. Do you think the term lifetime needs"
8065360,8071520," to become protected? I mean, I thought it was I thought it was 25 years. I don't know. 35 years"
8071520,8076480," or whatever. I thought lifetime in any form of marketing like was like a limited lifetime warranty"
8076480,8081920," is within the reasonable expected lifespan of the product. Like that's why we had that whole"
8081920,8090480," warranty conversation where at the end of the day, oh God, the value of a warranty is only in the"
8090480,8099280," company's will to honor it. That is true. It is a true thing. Our will to honor our, to support our"
8099280,8104160," products, to honor our warranty, to honor our commitment to you guys is extremely high."
8104160,8108640," And like, yes, you can take companies to cord over it and stuff like that, but it"
8108640,8114560," no one will. It often becomes far too unreasonable for a standard user. So that no one will and"
8114560,8120160," class actions suck. All they do is enrich lawyers. There's basically no recourse. So"
8121600,8132160," with that in mind, no, I don't think lifetime does have any particular actual meaning that"
8132160,8137680," carries any kind of weight. I think lifetime means whatever they decide it means. And in this case,"
8137680,8141680," they are altering the agreement and pray they don't alter it further. There's a"
8141680,8147040," nice. There's another discussion question which ties into kind of what you're just saying that"
8147040,8151360," says, when you buy a product, what does lifetime mean in your eyes? What should it mean? To me,"
8151360,8157840," you're gonna throw this in here, I will always look into the company, if that is said. And if it's"
8157840,8163680," like snap on or something, that's just the main one I can think of. Lifetime is going to mean a"
8163680,8169520," lot to me because like every customer you hear about from snap on will say, yep, their tools are"
8169520,8174320," incredibly expensive, but the truck comes by every Friday. And if something's broken, I get a new"
8174320,8179840," one, unless you talk to people whose truck is like not not bad or whatever. Right. I've heard"
8179840,8183920," some people say it's not always issues in relation to that. But as far as my understanding goes,"
8183920,8188480," if you break a snap on tool, my understanding is the policy is, and you might run into an"
8188480,8194720," idiot like that ICBC person that I ran into who just had it in their mind that they wanted to make"
8194720,8199600," your life worse that day. That can happen with any company. But my understanding is their policy"
8199600,8204240," is make it right. Yeah, which is so that's cool. So that would make and there's other"
8204240,8207760," companies that are like that. That was just the first one that came to mind. So that's cool."
8207760,8212320," It's expensive. You're paying for that service and the price of the tool. So if that's something"
8212320,8218560," that you want, then great, if not, whatever. But if I look into a company and I don't hear a lot"
8218560,8223680," of that about it and it says lifetime, I just assume bad. I just ignore it. Yeah, exactly."
8223680,8231040," I bought, I bought some files at Home Depot and it had like lifetime warranty all over the packaging."
8231040,8235120," But like the name of the company was not, there was no way to contact them or anything. I was like,"
8235120,8238880," okay, sure. Yeah, so it doesn't mean anything. So I'm just going to use these files until they"
8238880,8245280," are dull and then I will discard them because realistically you're not, yeah, it's consumable."
8245280,8249840," And if I try to claim warranty on a dull file, they're just going to tell me that it's worn out."
8249840,8252960," Yeah, so someone in full of playing chat, yes, snap on is stupid expensive, but my"
8252960,8257040," reference replaced any fail tool I've had, no questions asked. So I hear that a lot."
8257040,8262080," So I would believe that, but I believe that because users, yes, I don't believe that because of company."
8262080,8266560," And then I will always see it that way. And that is what it is."
8266560,8274400," Yeah, I like this. ADHD idiosyncrasy on float plane says lifetime should mean the same amount of"
8274400,8279280," time that a work is protected by copyright before going into the public domain and then let the"
8279280,8286480," two industries lobby it out. That's actually really, really good. Oh, I love it. That's really great."
8287440,8291200," Oh, man, I like that form of doing things. We should do that more often."
8291200,8298240," That's fantastic. Your rock or seat battle. Yeah. Oh, that's great. Oh, I really like that."
8298240,8303120," Okay. Should we, are we covering more things or we ditch an emergency?"
8303120,8307040," Let's do some merch messages. Let's call it. Let's call it. It's 830."
8307040,8311920," All right, got anyone here from Eric with a successful launch of the screwdriver and backpack."
8311920,8318400," If you could launch a V2 today, what would you change about them? Wow, that's a good question."
8318400,8322560," Define a V2 because you're releasing the shorty, right? Or whatever it's going on."
8322560,8326000," Yeah, that's not a V2. That's a completely different. I have one. You want to see it?"
8326000,8328080," Yeah, sure. Oh, I don't. I lied. Sorry. Never mind."
8328080,8331440," I left my backpack at home today. It's usually here."
8331440,8335920," So that's that's very rare. Well, I wasn't in office today. I was shooting at my house."
8336720,8340480," Yeah, I like zoomed over here to do ancho. That makes sense. Anyway, yeah, yeah."
8340480,8347840," Man, for backpack, I think the answer would be to do two versions at the same time."
8347840,8352560," I think that we've gotten enough feedback from people that they would rather have it be smaller"
8352560,8359760," and particularly that they'd rather it was smaller that I think that less, it's less of a like,"
8359760,8364320," here's what I would do as a V2 of this product and more that here's the second version of it that I"
8364320,8369120," would launch alongside. We are working on that now. There are some challenges getting the ergonomics"
8369120,8377360," right with a smaller bag. We still want to keep our anti-chafing straps. You see a ton of feedback"
8377360,8382080," in the in the reviews for the backpack that like, man, I took all the stuff out of my old bag. I"
8382080,8386160," put it in the new bag and it just like feels lighter. That's not an accident that took a ton of work."
8386160,8390880," We want to make sure that we nail that for the smaller one as well. But if I if I could go back"
8390880,8395200," and do it again, I would have wanted to launch them alongside each other. And for screwdriver,"
8395200,8402800," man, I don't know. I don't think we will I don't think we will revise screwdriver for a very,"
8402800,8408240," very long time. We've had a couple of reports of the clips breaking from people dropping it."
8408240,8415600," Oh, in the retention clips. It's rare, but it's happening. So it's something that, you know, if"
8415600,8421840," it's less of a V2 and more of like a V1.1 though. So if we could make some small revisions to something"
8421840,8432640," like that, I'd like to make them. I feel like accessories or alternates are the main things."
8432640,8438560," So like Shorty. Yeah, Shorty's coming. Maybe a bit holder. Bit holder's coming. Like, yeah, like,"
8438560,8444880," we hired two more like mechanical engineers specifically with experience and tool making"
8444880,8447360," in the last like three months. Very cool. So"
8447360,8456160," are we already past 100? I think maybe. How many are on your team? I don't know anymore."
8456160,8460320," Depends how you slice the team, but I think if you're going with"
8461040,8470480," Flowplane Inc. I think that's 19. Really? It's 18 or 19. A flowplane Inc? Flowplane media Inc?"
8470480,8475040," Yeah. Oh, then we're well over 100. Not the Flowplane project to be clear, but like"
8475040,8482400," any contractor is under Flowplane Inc. Right. I don't know if you knew that. Okay. So like the"
8482400,8488000," Labs Web team. Oh, I have no idea then. I actually do not know how many people work here."
8489280,8495040," It's that big. It's hard even just counting. I've gone to the point where"
8495040,8498080," when we have morning meetings and I'm like trying to check if everyone's there."
8498080,8499840," That can take me a sec."
8499840,8506000," Because I actually like actually go through all of it. I'm like, jeez, a lot of people."
8506000,8512560," Yeah. Yeah. Anyways, enough, enough people, I think."
8514080,8519600," No, I sent someone. I don't know if they're off probation, so I won't say it. But I sent"
8519600,8524800," someone in email today being like, hey, so I need to hire this position if you help me with that"
8524800,8531360," starting next week. Oh, to our HR person? Yeah. We have a dedicated HR person as far as I can tell"
8531360,8538000," aside from like, okay, I don't mean this is like a knock because she does a lot."
8538960,8543920," Like she did some work on like our GRSP program that we introduced and like some other stuff."
8543920,8550320," But as far as I can tell, basically all she's done since she started is like interview people,"
8550320,8559360," hire people. Yeah. We've been hiring so much. Logistics doesn't have any computers anymore."
8559360,8564800," I heard about this problem. Yeah, we have like no more laptops to give people. We've got no more"
8564800,8571520," standardized workstations. I think we bought every single one of motherboard type that exists."
8571520,8578320," We just can't get computers. Oh. That is a first time problem for us. Yeah."
8578320,8582640," For anyone watching, usually we've had so many samples come in that everyone's just running on"
8582640,8586800," sample machines and the rate that samples come in has always been high enough. But it's been"
8586800,8593840," fairly static. Yeah. So it was staying the same. The rate of new people is going up."
8594560,8597840," I had to give my quadro in my computer to an actual engineer."
8597840,8605200," Why do you have a quadro in your computer? I do a lot of solid works. That's amazing."
8605200,8611200," Now some things I know we outstripped a long time ago, like we've been buying CPUs for at least"
8611200,8617200," a few years now. That makes sense. Because you can't just use like old gen CPUs for a lot of what we do."
8617200,8622240," Like Nick, on float plane, there's an exclusive of Nick getting a new workstation."
8622240,8628640," So he got the best buy gaming PC from our first best buy gaming PC video like seven or eight years"
8628640,8633120," ago. And he's been complaining about it ever since because he's one of the most senior people"
8633120,8640880," in the company now. And newcomers get machines with a ramstick that's worth as much as his"
8640880,8644640," entire computer. And he's like, I'm like, what do you even do? Emails? He's like,"
8644640,8648320," yeah, but my computer sucks. I'm like, yeah, write an email about it."
8650800,8656560," So anyway, we finally gave him a new computer. And it's the one from the best buy secret"
8656560,8661520," shopper gaming PC from like a week ago. Oh, I thought it was from like way. No. So there's an"
8661520,8668800," exclusive of Dennis dressed up as Santa bringing him his new computer. And it's another best buy PC."
8668800,8677440," Oh man. Yeah. Love it. He rains everyone else with gifts of merch and all this other type of"
8677440,8681440," stuff. And then you can't even get a computer. Give him a trash computer. So"
8681440,8687360," sad. Anyway, but like that was the norm probably up until about three years ago that we would just"
8687360,8691200," use whatever we had kicking around because like what it's a functioning computer. What do you want?"
8691200,8698800," Like do your job, right? You got a computer. Let's go. But no, now it's like, I talked about it when I"
8698800,8704240," did the the video recently, like what computer would I buy because we do have to buy our computers"
8704240,8711680," now. And one of the reasons is that while we probably have enough hardware to throw together"
8711680,8717440," computers for everyone, like in inventory, it would affect our ability to make videos. And those"
8717440,8723040," computers would be so random that the upkeep on that fleet of machines would be a nightmare."
8723040,8728640," Standardization is actually nice. Yeah. Well, your new solution didn't work either. We're still"
8728640,8734800," struggling, but we'll get through it. I mean, I gave you guys the money. I gave you money."
8734800,8739200," Yeah, well, it's a enough money. I heard money solves people's problems, right? Give us more money."
8739200,8746000," That's always the fix to the previous problem. More money. I need different"
8746000,8749760," companies to buy computers from. That's actually the problem."
8749760,8756080," Because they just are like out of whatever we need to buy. I want this type of motherboard for"
8756080,8763600," this chipset and we can't get it. And so either we have like three to five different standard"
8763600,8771760," computers. Yeah, right? That's not standard then. Exactly. It's all falling apart."
8771760,8776320," Make more motherboards. Someone said, I actually just thought about them before I saw this message,"
8776320,8782160," but it's, they said, whoa, it's a long one that pushed it all the way off. How weird would it be"
8782160,8786160," if LTT went to Puget Systems for computers? The problem is they're over the border."
8786160,8792640," Yeah. So it's like huge issues there. Yeah, it's pin the butt. So it's easier for us to just"
8792640,8803360," buy things here. I reached out to Nick from logistics because my dad is going to be making a"
8803360,8812080," donation to the company's inventory of a GTX 9800. Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah."
8812080,8818640," Apparently we're missing. Very nice. And 9800 GTX. Oh, right. Sorry. Yeah."
8818640,8823360," Yeah. Right. That was before they reversed them. Yeah. Yeah. It looks amazing, by the way."
8823360,8828560," The old shroud and stuff. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. And I realized this after I sent the message,"
8830400,8835120," but he's going to be donating a card that is definitely from work."
8835120,8840960," So we're going to be getting him back."
8840960,8850720," After he's like, he's asked me what to do with these cards. And I was like, I don't know. And I"
8850720,8855200," reached out to Nick to see if work would need him. And then I realized like a few hours after I"
8855200,8859360," sent the picture, I was like, wait, I remember that card. I tested that card like back in the"
8859360,8864720," garage. Somehow my dad ended up with it. And you tested it at home, I guess. Yeah. And then it"
8864720,8869200," probably got, you know, handed down from from me to my dad at some point. Oh, he still has it."
8869200,8874800," It's like a twin froze or two. I didn't I couldn't actually tell from the picture, but I think it's"
8874800,8882720," like a like a 560 or something. Okay. But yeah, apparently they both fit slots that are vacant"
8882720,8888160," in the like, right, log of GPUs. So does every coming home and one is new."
8888160,8893920," Does everybody just check stuff out, Linus or like not? I don't know. I worked in logistics."
8893920,8898800," Things used to be a little more Lucy Guissey back in the day. And Luke in particular,"
8898800,8904080," probably got too much leeway. I mean, he didn't get paid enough."
8904080,8911440," Like, let's be real. Yeah. I didn't have any money. It's not like I could give you money,"
8911440,8916080," but I had hardware and you like hardware. Hardware is pretty cool. And you know, what's really"
8916080,8921600," funny is like even back then, I would tell potential sponsors and like companies that we"
8921600,8926320," would partner with would be like, no, look, because influencer marketing wasn't as big of a thing"
8926320,8930880," back then tech companies weren't used to actually like paying money for advertising."
8930880,8936880," They had tried to skate by on just the tech news industry being a bunch of enthusiasts"
8936880,8943280," living at home in their basements or whatever. And just kind of compensating people in hardware."
8943280,8947680," Like one reviewer famously would ask for two of everything that they covered."
8947680,8953040," I remember this one to cover and one to sell on eBay. Like it was it was a whole thing, right?"
8953040,8958800," And so I remember telling like trying to shift this mentality, like, look, I can't pay my staff in"
8958800,8965040," computer parts. I need actual money to run this business. And ultimately we won that battle."
8965040,8970880," We actually, you know, are a successful, I think company now at this point, but it was actually a"
8970880,8976640," lie because at least one of my employees, I did definitely help them at least top up in hardware."
8976640,8982720," I I've never I've obviously never sold any of it. And theoretically, unless I like lost things"
8982720,8989520," like that one, they they come back eventually. But yeah, that is definitely true. Yeah."
8989520,8992960," Okay, I'm going to pull you guys back on track. Let's get through these merch messages."
8992960,8993520," Yeah, for sure."
8993520,8996080," Dan wants to go home. You're here first."
8996080,8997280," I'm saving you from yourself."
8997280,8998640," Kind of true."
8998640,9000320," I got one. It's like hanging out with the people."
9000320,9005360," It's fun. It's fun. I got one from Shane. I'd said I'd buy two plaid shirts. If you made it"
9005360,9010800," purple, got to put my money where my mouth is. Last week, you mentioned making a smaller screwdriver"
9010800,9014080," and showed a stubby version on social. Glad you have it with you today, Linus."
9014080,9019200," Have you all considered making one specifically for small electronics with a torque limit?"
9019200,9025360," I don't think we have a torque screwdriver planned right now. It's definitely not impossible,"
9025360,9031360," but that it would not be it's not on a road map. So if you see one and you like it, go buy it."
9031360,9032960," Don't wait for ours."
9032960,9038400," Okay. Got another one from Sam. Hey, guys, do you have any experience with vintage display tech"
9038400,9045440," like Nixi tubes or I TS 1A thyrotrons? That's a new one for me."
9045440,9047040," I've never heard of that, but it sounds amazing."
9047040,9049520," I want a thyrotron. That's from follow. Oh my God."
9049520,9052240," I would love to see a clock assembly stream."
9052880,9059440," Past indicators sent me one of their Nixi tube clocks. My understanding is they sometime ago"
9059440,9067280," acquired a lot of inventory of these vintage Nixi tubes. They don't make them anymore as far as"
9067280,9072720," I can tell. Yeah, here's their site. We install original Soviet Nixi tubes from the 70s and 80s."
9072720,9077840," I do have a clock. I have one of their clocks on my desk. I think it's super cool. But beyond"
9077840,9084240," just thinking it's really cool the way that all the numbers are front to back like this and they"
9084240,9089200," glow to illuminate and stuff like that. I don't know really anything about them. Yeah, it's super"
9089200,9094560," cool. See all the layers of these like filaments or whatever they are? Only the active one glows,"
9094560,9098560," and you can actually see it through all the others. But each number is a discrete element in"
9098560,9102320," here. It's like super cool. Yeah, they're super cool. I didn't actually know this how that works."
9102320,9107600," Yeah. Yeah, they're really cool. And you can see like weird little like, you know, cost saving"
9107600,9113840," measures in Soviet Russia. Dollar saves you. But like the two and the five are the same thing."
9113840,9119200," Just ones like this and ones like, you know, this. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. That's funny."
9119200,9120960," Yeah. Just a little funny stuff like that. Yeah."
9120960,9125840," Easier manufacturing. Oh, yeah. I know the thierichons. They're like the square versions of those."
9125840,9132720," Cool. Yeah. Okay. I've got one here from Aaron. I know you're still trying to figure out your"
9132720,9138240," shirts. But once you do, would you consider doing a print to order for shirts? No, no, no,"
9138240,9144240," the quality's crap. Not a shot. No shot. Absolutely not. It's just"
9144240,9156000," we I'm stubborn. And I think shirts should look good and feel good. And so we're not going to"
9156000,9161040," ship a shirt that doesn't look good and feel good. That was the whole reason that we ultimately"
9161680,9166800," went and built this whole creator warehouse thing was I was so tired of getting screen"
9166800,9172880," printed samples and then finding out that people were getting direct to garment printed product"
9172880,9178960," that looked like garbage. Your other question was, are you going to do a laptop slash shoulder bag?"
9178960,9187360," It's really good. We have one. Leakier than it turned on."
9187360,9194800," False. I know, right? But the the shoulder strap. Okay. Shoulder strap on laptop bags. Like just"
9194800,9201360," sucks. You know, it never distributes the weight properly. It always falls down or rides up or"
9201360,9208800," like it slides too easily or not easily enough in the strap. We nailed it. I'm really happy."
9209600,9218480," It's closely based on the our padded straps for the backpack but tuned for obviously the different"
9218480,9223760," angle that it's going to be sitting on your shoulder and man, like everyone in the team's"
9223760,9228320," like super stoked like Nick, Bridget, Matthew, me, all the people who have like tried it."
9228320,9235200," It's good. It's really good. And because it's designed by us, it has room for a bloody charger"
9235200,9241360," in it. Right? I've seen laptop bags that are all like nice and they look good and then they're just"
9241360,9246240," like, right in the middle. It's like, oh my goodness. I have always appreciated about"
9246240,9252800," Creator Warehouse and the LTT store about how they sell like merchandise that is heavily marketed"
9252800,9259120," by a creator. But it's not like merch. Yeah. I really got stuff using that word. Good. Yeah."
9259120,9262000," We should probably rename merch messages, stuff like that. Yeah. Because it's not,"
9262720,9269200," that gives it association with merch, which is usually junk with a logo on it. Yeah. It's not all."
9269200,9275200," Some of it's good, right? Ours is good. Some of the people's is good. But in general, I think the"
9275200,9280400," assumption that is made when you hear merch is that it's junk with a logo on it. And that's,"
9280400,9287360," that's not what we sell. We sell good stuff. Hey Linus, I know you made some long video runs for"
9287360,9292400," your home computers. Is there a noticeable latency hit from using optical to copper cabling? No."
9292400,9298400," No. I mean, it's speed of light, whether it's light or whether it's electrons running down a"
9298400,9305680," wire, it's functionally speed of light. And the converters are extremely fast. You wouldn't,"
9305680,9310080," if you think you're noticing it, you're imagining it. Okay. This one's from Mitchell. Hey, guys,"
9310080,9314640," love the show. I work in commercial construction and was wondering if you had ever looked into tech"
9314640,9319680," used on construction sites, like using Lidar to measure the walls for window and siding or"
9319680,9324080," augmented reality to see the finished product when there's just the skeleton up."
9324080,9332400," The closest I think we got was in somewhat controversial video, the Prepper PC video,"
9332400,9338240," where I think probably the most interesting content in it was when we got one of these like"
9338240,9344640," underground conduit trackers. So basically it's like a snake with a transponder on it."
9344640,9351120," And then a handheld like like like divining rod thing for finding where that where that"
9351120,9357520," buried conduit is. And it was super cool. Unfortunately, I like I wasn't in touch with the company or"
9357520,9361760," anything. I was just using the tool. So we didn't get to share a lot about how exactly it works"
9361760,9367120," or anything like that. But I think that's about the closest we've been. But yeah, that actually sounds"
9367120,9369840," like a like a super cool direction we could take things."
9373200,9378960," Hi guys, question for Luke. Have you considered doing native 1440p resolution on floodplain?"
9378960,9386720," Not really? No. Realists that there's there's even some I've been said some screenshots of"
9386720,9390080," this. I don't know. Maybe it was from you. I don't remember. But there's there's some like video"
9390080,9397520," players in Japan that don't do their their quality selection by resolution. Yeah, they do it by bit"
9397520,9404640," rate. Yep. Sweet. Our 4k is more bit rate. It's a little bit more complicated than that. Sure."
9404640,9409600," But like you're just adding a selector between 4k and 1080 and then we have to"
9409600,9415120," transcode a whole new thing and like is I don't really see the point we don't actually get asked"
9415120,9422800," for it very often. It's very uncommon that we do actually. I'm even a 1440p monitor boy. And"
9422800,9428640," I don't care because I just watch in 4k like because you get because you get more bit rate like."
9428640,9434320," They do specifically say their old laptop had a 1440p display but struggled to decode it 4k."
9434320,9441280," That is such an edge case I think that to take on the storage burden of every video at 1440p is"
9441280,9446240," just not. It's a laptop screen. It's smaller. Just run it. It's gonna look fine. Our 1080 looks"
9446240,9451520," really good. Not all 1080s credit equal. This is why some of those Japanese players do it based"
9451520,9456320," on bit rate and sort of resolution. It's actually like pretty darn good at 1080p."
9456320,9461680," Yep. Yeah. Last clear-rated one I've got here is from Devin. Hey guys glad I could tune into"
9461680,9465920," the stream this evening. Any plans to discuss the YouTube policy change today that supposedly"
9465920,9472320," has a bunch of channels suddenly demonetized? Thanks. I suspect neither of us knew about that."
9472320,9481280," I also suspect. Yeah. It doesn't seem like anybody. I was not aware of this."
9481280,9484240," News."
9484240,9493840," I don't see anything. Yeah. I don't see anything right now."
9493840,9497280," I actually got a couple of merge messages about this so I'm not entirely sure"
9497280,9499840," where this has come from."
9500320,9502240," Um."
9502240,9511920," YouTube policy change. Okay. How about just YouTube policy news?"
9511920,9517680," The most recent update I see is- I'm gonna try searching for it on Bing."
9517680,9525440," Okay. So there's updated November 2022. More low quality content principles for kids and"
9525440,9529680," family content are now in scope for YouTube channel monetization taking effect in December"
9529680,9533200," 2022. That's the only thing I've found and that sounds like it's uh"
9533200,9544800," maybe like adding. I don't know. Well here's Bing. Nice. Nice. Let's go. Nice. Good job Bing."
9544800,9547840," Well wait hold on."
9547840,9558560," Whatever this is. Change swearing rules retroactively applied. Apparently they did not like last"
9558560,9568400," win show. Are there any changes? There are no changes to our policies. Um okay. So this very angry"
9568400,9575600," looking guy has a video apparently moist critical did a video about it. Oh okay. Okay."
9575600,9581680," Okay. Well sorry. We don't know anything about it. I am the one view on this video apparently."
9581680,9586880," Oh. Let's go. This is what Bing is good for though. Surfacing something other than"
9588400,9594720," you know what everyone else was looking for. Yeah. I mean in this case that I mean it might not"
9594720,9600000," be necessarily the perfect resource for it but um yeah moist critical has a video on it from"
9600000,9605040," three hours ago. Huge YouTube change just ruined many channels. Um I mean I haven't watched it."
9605040,9608800," I know nothing about it but maybe I guess you guys can go check that out. This is breaking"
9608800,9614000," breaking. Um and then I've got some uh potentials for you guys to have a look at if you uh if you"
9614000,9621840," want or uh sure. Um I think we've talked enough about tech companies not following through with"
9621840,9629680," promises Logan D. Um thank you for sending in the message. Uh Daniel E. What do you think the next"
9629680,9636160," shop slash IT technician tool upgrade you could see need to improve is uh flat end cutter multi tool"
9636160,9641120," built in device reset slash sim tool for cable management. I am not sure. Uh we don't have anything"
9641120,9646640," on the road map right now for IT tools. Uh definitely more screwdriver stuff coming down the line though."
9646640,9652400," Uh okay I'll go through these. I'll go through these pretty quick. Everyone wants to get home. Theodore"
9652400,9657360," H love the show. Have you considered doing an extreme upgrade style show with some more gaming"
9657360,9664080," streamers like Stone Mountain 64. It's tough to collaborate with people who are not local. Um"
9664080,9670400," that's one of the reasons that Intel Extreme Tech upgrade is with our employees because uh it"
9670400,9676080," honestly they're already a nightmare to arrange all of the procurement for and set aside a shoot day"
9676080,9680800," for and you know get everyone on set and all the equipment blah blah blah blah blah. I mean if"
9680800,9687280," it was in like Arizona or something whole other level whole other level. Now it's a three day"
9687280,9692560," commitment for me instead of a one day commitment and as you can probably imagine I'm our biggest"
9692560,9697600," bottleneck a lot of the time and for what it's it's completely the same piece of content."
9699440,9705600," So it's it's tough to justify. Uh there's someone asking if we're if we have interest in checking"
9705600,9711600," out NASA. I mean sure but that's one of those things. You have to show us something cool. Yeah it's"
9711600,9716880," kind of like the ISP like sure but I'm not just gonna stand outside the building and be like look"
9716880,9721360," it's NASA. And and it can't be something that you just show everybody on a normal tour. Yeah"
9721360,9727440," it would have to be something where you're letting us go behind some closed doors which I seriously"
9727440,9731840," doubt is gonna happen. Yeah this says something about private tour. I don't think I've ever taken"
9731840,9737520," a private tour of anything. In fact even when I went to Micron when I went to Intel both of them"
9737520,9741600," my tour guide offered to show me things that could not be included in the tour and I said no don't"
9741600,9748960," waste my time because for me I'm there to bring you guys along. So if they're just showing it to me"
9748960,9754160," then what's the point? I might be down off camera but that's a totally different thing."
9754160,9757280," That's this. I'm really into that stuff but that like that's not gonna. Well it's not gonna not"
9757280,9762880," into it. I have a job to do. Yeah I'm just saying like it's not it's not gonna happen on camera"
9762880,9770640," basically. So it's probably not what you're looking for but yeah yeah. Thanks for offering"
9770640,9775920," though either way like I don't want to be like that about it. I've taken advantage of a couple"
9775920,9781680," viewers that reached out about saying that they like could get me access to something cool but I"
9781680,9788800," couldn't like put on the channel. I went to go see a really cool laser lab in Sweden. I went to"
9788800,9792080," go to other stuff. I like happened to be in that area and I knew I was there and they're like by"
9792080,9798960," the way do you want to come check this out? And I'm like yes that looks awesome. So I don't know but"
9798960,9802800," I actually hold on before we do any more merch messages I've got a few things on my little"
9802800,9808960," notepad. Shirt printing update we already ended up doing. Backpack zippers. Still very much a work"
9808960,9815520," in progress. Tynan was on vacation for it's been Christmas season and stuff. Tynan is the one who's"
9815520,9823280," on point for that. He was on vacation for a while and stuff. There's some delays waiting for things"
9823280,9828800," to go back and forth. The entire creator warehouse engineering team has had to spend a lot of time"
9828800,9833760," setting up their new shop. So when we did our creator warehouse tour that video is completely"
9833760,9840800," out of date now. What used to be the entire engineer area is now completely like a workshop."
9840800,9845440," So they have an electronics area. They have way better 3D printers now and stuff. They can do"
9845440,9851280," so much more fabrication and like rapid prototyping. And then they all have their desks upstairs in"
9851280,9855600," what was like the weird like suite area that used to be a living space for the previous owner."
9855600,9862240," So things have been delayed a little bit. Tynan's on it. We're going to find a solution. We're having"
9862240,9870960," a hard time designing a cheaply fabricated plastic tool to swap it out. We're still confident that"
9870960,9880960," we can solve it. There you go. Richard Gee the NASA guy. Reach out somehow like my Twitter or"
9880960,9887360," even support it for open.com and I can just have Joe to hand me the ticket information."
9887360,9893280," Linus Tech Tips at gmail.com is our other broadly available public facing email address that does"
9893280,9900000," get checked. If we can't figure out something for work which if we can see cool things like if we"
9900000,9907520," could see how you guys deal with like data and communicating with things like that could be really"
9907520,9911920," cool if you guys are willing to let us see that. But if it can't be on camera I'm also"
9911920,9918480," interested in going down personally. Another thing that I have in here. Update on the person who"
9918480,9922480," called me out of touch for thinking our printer is being dumb our t-shirt printer."
9922480,9926800," I responded to them and then last I think it was last week I also talked about how I'm just"
9926800,9931280," going to be like shadow banning a lot more liberally. I did it like five times and I was like this is"
9931280,9939920," pointless. So I give up. Just so you guys know I what I realized is like A this isn't going to do"
9939920,9947520," anything because it's an endless flood of just like whether it's bad takes or whether it's just"
9947520,9952720," people going out of their way to to view whatever it is I'm saying or doing in the worst possible"
9952720,9959280," light. Like it's it's never going to stop. And so if I if I wage a war against it effectively I lose."
9959280,9965600," And so the other thing too is that every once in a while I mean a stop clock is right twice a day"
9965600,9970880," right so if I shadow ban these people and they do come at me with some kind of valid feedback"
9970880,9980240," in the future I'm missing out on that. So I update for you guys. I I blocked like like four"
9980240,9986000," or five people from from commenting on the YouTube channel. I would undo it actually if I could I"
9986000,9989680," just have no idea how to even do I just did it on mobile and I don't even know what their names"
9989680,9997120," are anymore. So sorry. But the rest of you. It's an interesting problem because like I can"
9997120,10001360," understand a lot of people that are like never ban anyone open discussion is always best. Well,"
10001360,10007200," I've often been on that train but then you have to understand that any any good thing ever is"
10007200,10014640," going to be ruined by humanity because people will see some structure like that. Yeah, then ruined."
10014640,10020960," Yeah, that's all such. But yeah, people are going to see a system like that and go, oh,"
10020960,10026320," I don't get banned for any reason. I'm just going to make this person's life horrible by being just"
10026320,10032480," incredibly disingenuous and clearly obviously starting arguments based on things that are"
10032480,10037600," obviously not true or obviously not said or obviously weren't the reasoning or the or the"
10038240,10046160," meaning of what that person said or whatever else and they just brutalize. But banning people"
10046160,10051520," also does create tons of problems. So I don't know. The best solution that I have personally seen"
10051520,10058240," is the community like correcting itself. And we've even talked about that before. We're like,"
10058240,10062480," I think this conversation that we had specifically was about Twitter or someone will like tweet"
10062480,10069840," something at us. And it's like, oh, man, I really want to reply to this in a certain way. But I like"
10069840,10077120," probably shouldn't. So I won't. And it's like taxing on your like emotional state. And then you"
10077120,10082800," see some viewer just come out of left field and there's like, bam, and you're like, thank you."
10082800,10089120," And I can't I can't like your response. I can't interact with it. But thanks, bro. Thanks."
10089120,10092960," Thanks for writing what I couldn't. Yeah, that's cool. Thanks, man."
10092960,10099360," So I don't know that I guess that would be my only suggestion. And you do see it happen."
10099360,10107200," And I don't know. It is what it is. By the way, this was this was the last note I made for myself"
10107200,10114640," to talk about when we were discussing a wonder share and trying to like bury those product pages"
10114640,10121520," that can and how the internet kind of never forgets, but only just barely. So it also does. This is"
10121520,10128640," a really interesting story. There was a Charlottesville weekly publication called The Hook that closed"
10128640,10135200," a decade ago, but its archives lived on until its 22,000 stories were suddenly taken offline in"
10135200,10139520," June. If you guys want to learn more about this, the Washington Post didn't article about it."
10139520,10147120," Former staffers have theories about its mystery buyer. But basically, as far as people seem to be"
10147120,10158480," able to tell, it's because there was an article about a rape accusation against this buyer"
10158480,10165680," who seems to have bought the publication just to delete it. Whoa. Wild, hey? So this kind of ties"
10165680,10174160," into some discussions we've had really over the last few months about the consolidation of"
10174160,10181520," the information that we're getting in the hands of a very small few. It's not really good viral"
10181520,10188480," tweet a little while ago that was like, if you're outraged that Twitter has fallen into the hands"
10188480,10194400," of some Jack Fess billionaire, wait until I tell you who owns Facebook."
10194400,10201120," Who owns everything else? That's one of the things I've talked to this before, and I think people"
10201120,10205120," don't really understand by point, and maybe it's because I'm not saying it well enough. But people"
10205120,10209280," are super mad at Elon because he's public. His biggest sin is saying the quiet part out loud."
10209280,10216080," Yeah. There's so many more of them. You shouldn't just be mad at only that one because he's really"
10216080,10223600," loud. I mean, it is obnoxious. Sure. And you can be mad. But there's people do it. Okay."
10223600,10229280," I'm not defending him. I need that to be clear. I'm not and I'm not attacking either. Honestly,"
10229280,10233680," I don't care. I hated Twitter before. I hate it now. Nothing's really that different for me."
10233680,10239760," It was on fire. Now it's still on fire. I don't care how big the fire is. It was still on fire."
10240480,10248400," We didn't stop. But yeah. But a lot of things that people go after him for,"
10248400,10254240," it's like, dude, there's like just as bad or worse happening three feet to the left,"
10254240,10259840," but they're not publicly talking about it. So you think it's okay? Like that's what?"
10259840,10266320," But what aboutism is also not a valid defense? Fair enough. But I just don't think that we should"
10266320,10273440," only go after people that are more public about their actions. I think if you are against something,"
10273440,10281920," you should be against it and focus less on the individuals personally. But what do I know? Not much."
10281920,10288720," Hi, Linus and Luke. Do I either of you launch fireworks to celebrate?"
10291200,10300880," See you. Okay, then. Do you? There's a lot of restrictions on them now."
10300880,10307040," Yeah, I don't like them. Like I don't think you can... Oh, you have a very like fire-fightery kind of"
10307040,10313280," background. I always forget about that. Is that because of that? No. Like I know you were super into"
10313280,10318400," I was into it. Now my brother is one officially, which is awesome. Okay, I wasn't gonna like"
10318400,10324000," dox that. That's why I kind of approach that from a super weird angle. I think it's good enough to"
10324000,10329520," be to be public now. Yeah, congrats by the link. Great job, Rich. Finally, finally. He looks..."
10329520,10333280," You waited long enough. He looks real good in the uniform. He sports it really well."
10333280,10337440," Heck yeah. He's rising to the challenge exactly how I expected he would."
10337440,10343680," What was I gonna say? Yeah, but that's not actually... I mean, that part's a bit of a negative,"
10343680,10347600," but I don't think it happens all that often to be honest, especially at like sanctioned events."
10347600,10352960," What about like scaring animals and like... I don't like that part. Okay. I also like,"
10352960,10359680," oh, you look up and it's... This part has always bugged me, but you're looking up at cool explosion"
10359680,10364160," thing and sure, it's cool for a little bit. And then there's just all the like, I don't know the"
10364160,10371040," correct term, but the like black smog that it leaves behind. And I'm just like... Smoke."
10371040,10374320," I think this is what we're doing looking for. Is it just smoke? Yeah, it's smoke. But it's like"
10374320,10379440," it's not good smoke. But it's also like the emission from... I don't think it's... I don't think it's"
10379440,10385360," just smoke. Well, smoke is just particulate matter from burning or burning or something. It's smoke."
10385360,10390240," Yeah. It's nasty smoke. Yeah. And it lingers and it's gross and all the dogs freak out and all"
10390240,10394400," the other animals freak out and people can't sleep properly. And I'm just like, there's so many"
10394400,10399040," downsides to this. Fireworks are bad for veterans. Yeah, because it can sound like gunshots or"
10399040,10406080," explosions or whatever else because it is explosions. I just... Edible whale on Twitch with the red hot"
10406080,10410480," take. Luke would have to buy fireworks to use them. That is also a big problem. We know that ain't"
10410480,10418320," happening. Yeah, that is an issue. Fair. Fair. But like, I don't even really... I'm not like,"
10418320,10423040," I've gone to a few fireworks shows. I never really care that much. I always liked firecrackers more,"
10423040,10427280," which have been illegal here my entire life. So the only way to get them was to smuggle them."
10427280,10433440," Have I ever told the story of me getting detained at the border for trying to smuggle firecrackers"
10433440,10437440," into Canada? I mean, I guess if they caught you, you can tell the story. Yeah, I know the story."
10437440,10441520," Yeah. That might be story time for another day though, just because it's getting pretty late."
10441520,10448320," I love firecrackers. I love just like, bam, bam, bam, explosions. I've always been..."
10448320,10453120," He's like playing with cap guns and stuff like a mirror. I'm just not into it. I don't want to"
10453120,10458320," ban it or anything just to be clear. Yeah. One of my favorites was called... I don't know if it still"
10458320,10463680," exists, but it's called Little Dynamite. And they're essentially... Do you know what a Black Cat is?"
10463680,10469280," Oh, okay. Well, Black Cat's a brand, but that just like little... It looks like a little tiny stick of"
10469280,10474560," dynamite. So colloquially, we called those little tiny sticks of dynamite with the little Black"
10474560,10477520," Cat's written all over them, Black Cat's. And he just kind of goes, \"Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.\""
10479200,10485760," We would disassemble entire things of them so that you could use them more lip bar."
10485760,10490240," I don't know if you want to see what? Teach people how to make explosives."
10490240,10495680," Well, no, no, no, no, no, no, because they were designed with one fuse for like 100 of them."
10495680,10499200," So they'd go like, \"Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.\" But you could disassemble them and just"
10499200,10503280," make them into individual ones. And of course, I was an idiot teenager, so I would hold them while"
10503280,10507120," I was lighting them. Oh, wow. Yeah, I'd want to go off between my fingers once. They were numbing for"
10507120,10511600," hours. Anyway, my favorite, though, was one called little dynamite, which was basically like the"
10511600,10516800," little Black Cat ones, but waterproof, and a waterproof fuse. Oh. And so what I would do-- You"
10516800,10521360," could just terrorize fish. Well, no, I mean, we didn't have any fish in our pond, so whatever."
10521360,10528480," I mean, the frogs were probably not impressed, yes. But what I would do is I'd like stand on the"
10528480,10531520," shore of the pond, light them, and throw them in, and you could see them, they'd go down, and they'd"
10531520,10536880," make a little bubbles. Looks like a death charge. Yeah. And feels like it. Oh."
10537040,10544560," Because it's in the water, which is a non-compressible fluid. Yeah. It would actually transmit that energy"
10544560,10550480," into the shore all around it, even though it's this tiny, tiny little explosive. Interesting."
10550480,10553040," There's also lots of fun in like puddles and stuff. You throw it in a puddle to--"
10553040,10562880," I mean, I love that stuff, but whatever. They're not called M80s. That's a completely different thing."
10562880,10565760," Yeah. Yeah. I forget who made them."
10566480,10573600," Little dynamite. Yeah, they're also from Black Cat fireworks. Here you go. I don't know why you"
10573600,10581200," confused. This is it. Little dynamite. Firework type firecracker. 100 pieces of the loudest cracker"
10581200,10589040," on the market. No, I think we all know who the loudest cracker I'm going to do. I was going through"
10589040,10596720," my head like can I say this? Not on Twitch. So I guess I'm about to be-- Oh, boy. I'm about to get a"
10596720,10605520," suspension. Oh, geez. Anything else we should go over? Well, there's still a few. Okay. Sorry."
10605520,10609520," Nathan says, \"Budding YouTuber, I have the media production covered, but what resources"
10609520,10613120," advice do you recommend regarding all the backend stuff, like legal or financial coverage?\""
10613120,10618240," I would say get an audience first. Figure that stuff out later. Find yourself in a phone."
10618880,10625360," Yeah, though that couldn't hurt. Claude. The Squarespace ad reminded me of the time they got upset"
10625360,10629440," at Luke for adding the build it beautiful slogan to their Wanshow sponsor readings."
10629440,10634240," Are there any other examples from sponsors getting upset for things said during sponsor spots?"
10634240,10639120," Oh, plenty. I mean, we've crossed swords with-- I don't think they were that upset. They"
10639120,10642800," had just retired that phrase. And were like, \"Can you please stop doing that?\" Yeah. Yeah, it wasn't"
10642800,10647920," too bad. It wasn't too bad, Claude. Jimmy says, \"I'm old and remember the days of Leel Laport."
10647920,10650960," Leel Laport is still--\" \"Dil around.\" \"What do you mean, 'remember the days of Leel Laport?'\""
10650960,10655360," That's like when someone asked Weird Al, \"Who do you think this generation's Weird Al is?\" He's like,"
10655360,10663680," \"Me, obviously.\" Brutal. \"Why haven't you collabed with him yet? I've never actually met him.\""
10663680,10667360," We also don't, like you mentioned earlier, you kind of need to be like right here to be able to"
10667360,10671760," collab with, which is why we don't have a ton of collabs because it's like a lot of work. A lot of"
10671760,10676640," creators are on an extremely demanding schedule. Now you add a bunch of flights into it and all"
10676640,10682000," the time you stuff, it's difficult. Also, why don't you ever say \"quick bits on tech-linked\"? What's that"
10682000,10688400," about? I just-- I don't know. I remember telling Riley, like, nine years ago that I thought it was a"
10688400,10692880," dumb name or something and that I wouldn't say it or something. And then people thought it was"
10692880,10697520," hilarious that I wouldn't say it. So that's the only reason I do it now. I don't even care. I've"
10697520,10703360," forgotten. I've said it a couple times. James says, \"I currently mostly trust my 11-year-old son to go"
10703360,10706960," online without supervision. Occasionally checking his Chrome and YouTube history to reassure myself,"
10706960,10710880," but feel a bit guilty for doing so. Linus, how do you feel about monitoring your kids' online"
10710880,10714160," activity?\" I do-- >> Checking the history of the browser is not really doing that."
10714160,10722880," >> Yeah. They can delete that, you know. I do it utterly shamelessly and the way that I justify"
10722880,10729200," that to myself is I tell them I'm going to do it. I tell them I don't want to do it and I only ever"
10729200,10735760," actually do it if they give me some reason to distrust them. But yeah, no. I mean,"
10735760,10740800," online activities got to be monitored. My kids are not allowed to install apps without"
10740800,10746080," me specifically approving them. Like, it's funny. Having a tech savvy parent is a double-edged sword."
10746080,10753200," On the one hand, my kids had everything. Like, their own gaming computers, Nintendo Switch,"
10753200,10759760," Projector, Home Theater. We have like three separate TV areas in the house where you can watch a movie."
10759760,10765280," We got like Wicked Fast Internet, blah, blah, blah. Like, you name it. My kids have got it."
10765280,10771920," They--two of them have their own phones already, even though they're 10 and 8. But let me tell you,"
10771920,10778960," that [bleep] is locked down. >> So-- >> I don't know. It's tough."

10808800,10822800," >> Oh, wow. From a non-tech product management. >> Oh, shoot. Okay, while you're thinking,"
10822800,10829520," I accidentally just did the wrong thing with one. I think we have a women's v-net coming soon, Dore."
10833520,10839200," It depends how close to the dev teams you're getting. If all you're doing is requesting"
10839200,10847440," features and someone else handles all the actual stuff, setting up tickets, doing a b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b."
10847440,10858640," Then I think the main thing you need to understand is timelines are messed. Timelines are especially"
10858640,10863280," bad. I don't know if this is a grasses-greener situation, to be fair, but I find timelines"
10863280,10868800," in web development to be especially bad because there's so many other things that can happen that"
10868800,10874800," can screw up what you're working on. I've heard from some buddies that work in embedded systems"
10874800,10879920," and stuff that it's less chaotic because you pick what you're working on and then, oh, they release"
10879920,10886080," an update, okay, whatever, your system isn't going to get it. So who cares? When you're working in"
10886080,10892800," web dev, it's like, oh, okay, iOS randomly decides that they're going to start interpreting something"
10892800,10896080," in some different way. And it's like, well, you better update because all your stuff just broke."
10896080,10900960," So that can be really frustrating and that can happen in the middle of a development cycle."
10900960,10906000," So you can be like, we are 100% certain without a doubt. This is never going to happen. But let's"
10906000,10911200," say that did. We are 100% certain without a doubt that it will take us 3.7 weeks to do this."
10911200,10916640," And then three weeks in, someone completely unrelated to you. And there was no way you had"
10916640,10921040," any idea of knowing this is going to happen. Update something and it means you have to do a full"
10921040,10925200," rewrite. And it's just like, oh, or maybe not full rewrite, but you have to refactor some"
10925200,10931120," fairly significant portion of the code to be able to work better because they got rid of certain"
10931120,10935760," functions or they got rid of they did whatever else and it can be extremely frustrating."
10935760,10943680," So the main tip that I would do is add two weeks or double any timeline you ever hear"
10943680,10950080," from any developer. And this is not, this is not trying to be mean to the developers, like,"
10950080,10956080," seriously, they're great. They're doing their best. They are. But just trust me, do that."
10956080,10963280," If it's a short timeframe, add two weeks. If it's a long timeframe, double it. Like just,"
10963280,10972080," just do it. Because the over promise, sorry, under promise over deliver thing is a good way to go"
10972080,10977280," pretty much all the time. Because it's easier to give more than people expect. It's harder to take"
10977280,10982560," back from what people expect. And you're going to have issues logged for anyone. Yeah. Yeah,"
10982560,10986400," there's stuff like that can also happen. And that can just mess you up."
10986400,10994400," Like the world of software meltdown, all these different things, you can have expected time"
10994400,11001200," frames, you can have perfectly laid plans, just get obliterated by something that you had no way"
11001200,11009040," of foreseeing. So don't try to tie to reasonable timelines given by developers could developers"
11009040,11016160," are going to approach it in a nothing goes wrong sense. Because how you can't plan for it."
11016160,11020720," You want them to predict that this is going to happen. That's not going to happen. So like,"
11020720,11022400," that's why we don't read YouTube chat, by the way."
11026800,11031840," So let them let them put out their prediction and then build in the error for them."
11031840,11041440," And and try to go to bat for your dev team when when it needs to happen because working on I'm"
11041440,11044720," answering this for way too long. Sorry. But working on the type of things that they have to work"
11044720,11049920," on where they're sitting there. That's literally the last one. Sorry. Okay, so my last point,"
11049920,11054800," and then I'll let us go. They're going to sit there working on solving broken things all day."
11054800,11060720," That was very likely made by them, which can in a lot of cases be a fairly like emotionally"
11060720,11065520," grueling process. And then someone up the chain is going to come knocking. And while they've been"
11065520,11069280," like bleeding on their own code, trying to solve these problems for a week,"
11069280,11076000," you should try to be the one to answer the door and answer the question as to why it's not ready"
11076000,11081520," yet instead of them. Just free them up from that. Those would be those would be my points."
11081520,11084880," All right, I lied. I have one last thing. Brian Lovelace and float plane chat asks,"
11084880,11088480," in your home theater set up, why did you go with a denim versus a more robust solution like the"
11088480,11094960," Monoprice monolith HTTP dash one? I know the HTTP dash one doesn't have HDMI 2.1 just 2.0,"
11094960,11098480," but the ease of use and direct compatibility seem better than your denim choice."
11098480,11107360," I wasn't going to not have 4k 120 Hertz. Like it's I intend to hook a gaming PC up to it. And"
11107360,11114000," like it's a high refresh rate monitor or monitor projector. So nothing that didn't have HDMI 2.1"
11114000,11123520," was even remotely in the in the running, not even not even sort of a chance."
11123520,11130080," Makes sense. And I think that's pretty much it. Thank for you for tuning into the WAN show."
11130080,11137840," We will see you again next week. Same bad time, same bad channel. Bye!"
11137840,11140240," Oh, we cleared the queue. Got him."
11140240,11147280," Oh, it's in my other pants. That makes sense."
11147280,11151120," I changed pants."
11151120,11159040," Yeah, which is fine. This dream that was sponsored by Csonic. Manscaped. It's first base."
11159040,11161300," (laughing)"
11161660,11163160," (laughing)"
