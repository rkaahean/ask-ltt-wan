0,4000," What is up everyone and welcome to the WAN Show!"
4000,6000," It's the show where anything can happen."
6000,10000," Controversy, hot takes, controversy."
10000,11000," And even hotter takes."
11000,12000," And even hotter takes."
12000,13000," You'll find it all here."
13000,16000," We've got some great topics for you guys today."
16000,20000," The PlayStation VR2 launches next week,"
20000,22000," so we're going to be running you guys through."
22000,24000," Oh, no, you're going to have to do this topic."
24000,26000," Because full disclosure, I have already tried it,"
26000,29000," and I don't know what is or isn't under embargo."
29000,31000," So we'll figure that out."
31000,32000," Cool!"
32000,36000," Also, sorry."
36000,40000," I mean, I had looked into this a little bit,"
40000,42000," but I didn't know the price."
42000,49000," You can pay $144 a year for Facebook."
49000,52000," Sorry."
52000,54000," Okay, I'm sorry."
54000,57000," Okay, what else we got?"
57000,59000," Why do you pick--"
59000,60000," Why do you pick--"
60000,63000," Do you even know that Linus Rage Quit video games?"
63000,64000," Did you have--"
64000,65000," Did you have--"
65000,67000," Did you pick that as a headline topic?"
67000,68000," Everything else sucked."
68000,69000," Nothing happened this week."
69000,71000," None of you paid attention to the news all week,"
71000,72000," but nothing happened this week."
72000,74000," That wasn't if you're desperate topic."
74000,75000," And I'm desperate."
75000,76000," All right, so I picked it."
76000,78000," That's a great topic for us."
78000,79000," Okay, what else we got?"
79000,80000," Sorry for that."
80000,81000," Sorry for that."
81000,82000," I'm desperate, which I am."
82000,83000," The other one is going to be, oh, I don't know,"
83000,86000," Amazon expands into telehealth."
86000,90000," Really not YouTube ads dubbing podcasts and 1080p premium?"
90000,91000," Is that more interesting?"
91000,93000," We've already talked about 1080p premium."
93000,95000," No, we talked about 4K paid."
95000,97000," I'm pretty sure we included 1080p premium."
97000,99000," Or was that just something that we knew at the time?"
99000,100000," I don't know."
100000,102000," Because I definitely knew that at the time."
102000,104000," Let's roll the intro."
104000,109000," Dan, oh."
110000,112000," (laughs)"
112000,131000," The show is brought to you by The Ridge."
131000,133000," It's wear space."
133000,135000," And JumpCloud."
135000,136000," Hey, guess what?"
136000,138000," You guys get to witness a short"
138000,140000," production meeting."
140000,141000," (laughs)"
141000,144000," Yeah, they can't hear you if you're way over there."
144000,145000," So that's a challenge."
145000,147000," I don't think he cares."
147000,149000," (laughs)"
149000,151000," I can try to do the PSVR."
151000,154000," I think the phone should be bigger."
154000,158000," And I can't tell that that's real water tubes."
158000,161000," If there's anything we can do about that, that would be great."
161000,167000," As for the GPU challenge, yeah."
167000,168000," Yeah, sure."
168000,169000," That looks good."
169000,170000," I'm checking that one."
170000,172000," Oh, you want me to watch Apis?"
172000,174000," No, no, I wanted an audio pickup."
174000,176000," Wait, you want me to do an audio pickup?"
176000,177000," Real quick."
177000,178000," He said that."
178000,179000," Oh, good gravy."
179000,180000," Okay."
180000,181000," Luke's going to get the show started."
181000,182000," See ya."
182000,183000," Come on with the..."
183000,184000," Oh, so I'm just going to do it here?"
184000,185000," Here."
185000,186000," Okay, perfect."
186000,187000," Then we'll just..."
187000,188000," Yeah, that's great."
188000,189000," Then we'll just get the show started."
189000,190000," All right, our first topic today?"
190000,191000," (laughs)"
191000,193000," So sometimes when the show is late, that's what's happening."
193000,194000," (laughs)"
194000,195000," Yeah, this sort of thing."
195000,197000," What was our headline thing today?"
197000,199000," Yeah, you switch me to..."
199000,200000," Contal gamer, yes."
200000,201000," PlayStation VR2."
201000,206000," Hey, are reviews up yet or like what's the deal?"
206000,207000," What are we allowed to say?"
207000,208000," It's out."
208000,209000," It's out."
209000,210000," People can buy it."
210000,211000," People have it."
211000,212000," Then I can talk about it, right?"
212000,213000," Yeah."
213000,214000," I tried it."
214000,215000," Have you tried it?"
215000,216000," No."
216000,217000," Oh, there it is."
217000,218000," Yes."
218000,219000," PSVR2."
219000,220000," Luke."
220000,222000," It's enough to make me want a PlayStation."
222000,223000," Really?"
223000,226000," I want a PlayStation for the first time since the PS2."
226000,227000," Wow."
227000,231000," Yeah, like I wanted a PS2 because I wanted to play like Final Fantasy."
231000,235000," Have you tried the new Facebook one?"
235000,236000," The thinner one?"
236000,237000," Yes."
237000,238000," The like professional one?"
238000,239000," Yes."
239000,240000," And this is better."
240000,241000," Oh, dude."
241000,242000," Oh."
242000,243000," It's OLED."
243000,244000," Oh."
244000,245000," It's OLED."
245000,246000," Oh, I forgot about that."
246000,247000," It's actually pretty sick."
247000,249000," I've ever seen that in the specs and being like, \"Damn.\""
249000,250000," That's cool."
250000,255240," Exactly as damn as you think it is."
255240,256240," You can have a look at it."
256240,257240," Am I trying this?"
257240,258240," No, I mean, you can try it on."
258240,260000," Okay, I'll show you the adjustments."
260000,261000," Okay."
261000,262000," So there's two adjustments."
262000,263000," This button at the back."
263000,264000," Pretty normal."
264000,265000," Pulls it like that, okay?"
265000,266000," And twists to Titan."
266000,267000," That do be how we're heads."
267000,268000," Yep."
268000,269000," And then there's one here."
269000,270000," Yeah."
270000,271000," That goes like that."
271000,272000," Okay."
272000,273000," So a little something like that."
273000,275000," Oh, the screen though."
275000,276000," The screen."
276000,279800," We've got a full review coming soon where we try a bunch of different games."
279800,285840," And do like a short comparison against what kind of VR setup you could build."
285840,288560," Like a PC VR setup that you could build for the same price."
288560,292240," But this thing is exciting."
292240,293680," It came out this week."
293680,297280," Last week, Sony released a full official teardown showing off the new hardware."
297280,302920," And based on the specs and based on my experience, the PSVR 2 is a significant jump."
302920,307120," 4.1 megapixels for Peri versus 1 megapixel Peri."
307120,308120," HDR display."
308120,309120," Yeah."
309120,313680," HDR, Luke, HDR OLED."
313680,316880," And pupil tracking."
316880,318040," Pupil tracking."
318040,319040," That's right."
319040,322560," Foveated rendering."
322560,329720," Games look so good in spite of the on paper, lower graphical performance of the PlayStation"
329720,334520," 5 compared to a top tier PC."
334520,338920," This puts it miles beyond anything else that's in an equivalent price range, which is 515"
338920,342080," US dollars in terms of visual quality."
342080,343560," And I got it."
343560,345720," I got to tell you this."
345720,346720," Okay."
346720,347720," I expected."
347720,351000," I've never actually used eye tracking and Foveated rendering before."
351000,352960," I have used eye tracking before."
352960,355240," And I know that it's like can be pretty fast."
355240,357040," It could be pretty okay."
357040,362280," Can pull at rates of well in excess of 100 Hertz, which is, you know, pretty good."
362280,366760," But the eye moves faster than a lot of eye tracking technology."
366760,371800," And my concern was that with Foveated rendering, which I guess I haven't explained yet, what"
371800,375680," they're doing is they're tracking where you're looking, rendering just that spot."
375680,376680," I think it's what?"
376680,381040," 4% of your field of view is actually high res."
381040,385600," And then everything else is kind of junk tier, even if it was in focus, it would be junk"
385600,387320," tier, right?"
387320,391240," So what it does is it takes that spot you're looking at renders it at higher quality and"
391240,393680," then everything else kind of goes to crap."
393680,397040," And I couldn't tell if it was working from inside the headset."
397040,398200," In the sense, I'm saying."
398200,401040," Because it's so fast."
401040,402040," And Alex and..."
402040,403040," All right."
403040,407920," So if you like think something in your peripheral is poorly rendered, so you go to look at it,"
407920,409800," it's nicely rendered by the time you get there."
409800,411320," And I thought it just wasn't working."
411320,415400," I thought everything was just rendering it full quality because I like intentionally look,"
415400,416400," right?"
416400,419800," So, but then Alex was my, was my spotter."
419800,423600," And he had a TV set up capturing the experience."
423600,428880," And we played a little game where I said I was in Horizon, whatever the Horizon experience"
428880,429880," is called."
429880,430880," Oh, he had to try to guess where you were looking."
430880,433280," He had to guess where I was looking based on the render quality and he's just like,"
433280,435200," yeah, there and there and there."
435200,440640," And so I'd be like, I'd look, look, and I'd try to beat it and see the lore."
440640,441640," I couldn't do it."
441640,442800," That's kind of cool."
442800,443800," It's incredible."
443800,445640," Horizon Call of the Mountain, is that it?"
445640,447320," Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's the one."
447320,452920," And it is, it is, oh man, it's just, it's moving in the complete opposite direction of"
452920,455360," what Met is doing with their VR headsets."
455360,462360," It's, it's no unapologetically a non stand alone VR headset."
462360,465040," It's the best hardware they could build into a headset and you know what?"
465040,469560," It's still tethered to a box deal with it because that's what it takes to have this"
469560,470560," kind of fidelity."
470560,473160," I mean, that doesn't mean they haven't streamlined it."
473160,477440," The original PSVR had a large breakout box and a complex AV setup, where is this?"
477440,480440," It's a single USB-C cable."
480440,482880," Is it possible to turn off the eye tracking?"
482880,483880," I don't know."
483880,485160," Why would you want to?"
485160,487160," People with lazy eyes or other..."
487160,488320," Oh, that's a good point."
488320,489320," I didn't think of that."
489320,490920," Okay, I need to do that audio pickup."
490920,495120," Maybe talk about, I don't know, comfort or something and comfort also."
495120,501200," It has attached earbuds, which I'm not actually as much of a fan of because what if you have"
501200,505720," more than one person at your house that uses it or something?"
505720,512040," I would prefer the like the disc headphone things that I believe the index has."
512040,515640," Those were totally fine, in my opinion."
515640,516840," I'm not a huge fan of that."
516840,520320," But general comfort and stuff, actually quite good."
520320,521960," The earbuds come off."
521960,527520," Yeah, unless they have like built-in headphones that replace it, I'm not a huge fan of wearing"
527520,529800," other headphones with it either."
529800,534600," If they have additional headphones that you can buy that come with it and are designed"
534600,535720," for it, then that's cool."
535720,539120," But if not..."
539120,541240," I don't know, personally."
541240,542400," But yeah, comfort's good."
542400,547040," This shroud, this like rubbery shroud, it's got a 3.5mm jack."
547040,549360," Yeah, that doesn't solve it for me personally."
549360,551640," I don't want earbuds while I'm playing."
551640,553280," Well, yeah, I'm just a jack."
553280,554280," That's a perfect thing."
554280,555280," Yeah, they've said that."
555280,556280," I'm not super into that."
556280,558280," Well, here's the thing, right?"
558280,563880," The alternate solutions are either what Meta's doing with garbage tier audio."
563880,565520," It sounds so bad."
565520,568920," Or what Valve's doing, which presumably is expensive."
568920,572520," The index costs twice as much as this."
572520,573520," Still!"
573520,576040," And it doesn't even have an OLED display."
576040,577040," Then."
577040,578040," And all the screen door..."
578040,579480," You're gonna break them."
579480,581000," The screen door effect?"
581000,582000," Negligible."
582000,584160," You can still see it, I'm assuming."
584160,588760," There are actually headsets out there that are slightly higher resolution."
588760,591040," But it's real good."
591040,592040," It's real good."
592040,596720," And oh, the persistence is so low."
596720,599960," Like I got the headset on, I'm going like this, and I'm like, \"Wow!"
599960,600960," This is amazing!\""
600960,602960," I was like, \"No smearing!\""
602960,604720," I'm just gonna go like this."
604720,606640," This is my new game."
606640,607640," This is my..."
607640,609120," My external beacons."
609120,611080," No, that was the tracking."
611080,612160," It's okay."
612160,618840," I hope that Valve stays full purist and sticks with outside in tracking."
618840,625320," I literally wired up my house for their base stations."
625320,632440," My ceiling in my rec room has 12 volt power run inside it so that I can always have four"
632440,633440," base stations."
633440,636720," I am a one of a kind."
636720,640120," I suspect nobody else has actually done that."
640120,643160," But that's how committed I am to outside in tracking."
643160,648880," It really is superior from a performance standpoint, but it's inconvenient."
648880,649880," It's..."
649880,655120," I will say for a tethered experience, the single USB-C cable with no breakout box is"
655120,656120," pretty sweet."
656120,661920," Because I'm used to this thick cord of three different cables coming out that has to plug"
661920,666760," into some junction box at some point and then go into your computer in three different"
666760,671240," plugs to the point where you might be maxing out the USB on the back of your motherboard."
671240,672240," Exactly."
672240,673240," Blah blah blah."
673240,674240," It's super annoying."
674240,675240," Just having one cable is really cool."
675240,677080," I'm totally down with that."
677080,678080," Yeah, oh man."
678080,679080," 120 Hertz."
679080,685080," Oh, it weighs less than the previous one and it did feel like..."
685080,687520," Simple IPD adjustments."
687520,688520," Very cool."
688520,689920," Yeah, man, I'm excited."
689920,690920," However..."
690920,691920," How are the new controllers?"
691920,692920," Great."
692920,693920," They're right here."
693920,694920," Oh, hey, what's up?"
694920,695920," Yeah, I'm about..."
695920,698760," Okay, they're a little heavy."
698760,701600," Like rotationally, I find that..."
701600,703000," My hands too big."
703000,704000," This is kind of bulky."
704000,711480," And there are definitely some things about the headset that are Japanese designed."
711480,712480," That's one of them."
712480,713480," Got it."
713480,715120," I personally found that my..."
715120,716920," Oh, I actually found that very uncomfortable."
716920,723000," Roman nose was not super compatible with the headset."
723000,724560," You tried sliding it out though?"
724560,726600," Yeah, but I don't like that."
726600,732920," I like to have the headset tight against my face because I play games that require a"
732920,734160," lot of moving around."
734160,735640," And light leak sucks."
735640,737760," And well, the light leak is really good on it actually."
737760,740840," I did notice because the rubber thingy, but still that is usually a reason why you want"
740840,741840," it closer."
741840,748520," For me, a big part of why I want it closer is just so that when I move my head, I'm not"
748520,750480," feeling that drag, right?"
750480,751480," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
751480,755960," It's less leverage for it to move around on my face, right?"
755960,756960," And so I..."
756960,759640," No, someone said try pushing buttons."
759640,765040," Yeah, the trigger is hard because the bone of this part of my pinky..."
765040,766040," Luke Kim."
766040,767040," Yeah."
767040,768440," So the bone of that part of my..."
768440,769440," You can..."
769440,770440," Can I show you?"
770440,771440," Yeah, I can tell."
771440,773880," And I'm like bending my pinky in."
773880,778400," So even pulling the trigger feels super awkward because if you see the natural position of where"
778400,781500," my finger goes on, it isn't like up there."
781500,783160," That's extremely uncomfortable."
783160,786440," It's like down here because it's cranking my hand down."
786440,791960," And then even to get to this thumbstick is like my thumbs on full tilt."
791960,797400," So I don't know, I could do it, but not the biggest fan."
797400,799860," Bixby asks, \"What product doesn't have IPD adjustments?\""
799860,800860," Quest two."
800860,801860," Yeah."
801860,802860," They're digital."
802860,803860," They're fake."
803860,810560," Whereas the PSVR2 has proper IPD adjustment."
810560,815360," Alpha's Intel says, \"Luke, Bing chat GPT knows you were talking about it on Wancho."
815360,817960," It asks you not to be disappointed in its abilities.\""
817960,821160," Yeah, well, I think I talked about this last show."
821160,827400," I won't get into it too much, but I mentioned how it now has a form of memory because people"
827400,832500," are posting conversations that they have with it online and it can search the internet,"
832500,833500," right?"
833500,834500," So it has a form of memory."
834500,838020," It can see conversations that it has had in the future, not all of them, just only ones"
838020,839420," that people have posted online."
839420,841580," And it can see transcriptions of different things."
841580,847740," So if we have closed captions for this video, for Wancho, it might be able to have access"
847740,848740," to that."
848740,851020," It can't watch the video, but it could watch a transcript."
851020,854940," And it could see people discussing what we said on the show as well if there's text"
854940,856060," versions of that."
856060,859400," So it would be, I would expect that it would be aware of that."
859400,864240," I don't know if you want to call it awareness or I expect it would be able to search that"
864240,865240," up."
865240,866240," But yeah."
866240,867240," Oh, okay."
867240,868240," This is interesting."
868240,874720," I just poking into people are talking about using the PSVR2 on a PC, but the creator of"
874720,883560," the IVRE driver, which is a way to use the original PSVR on a PC basically says, \"Yeah,"
883560,885560," I don't think this is going to be that easy.\""
885560,886920," It goes, \"You'll be wasting your money."
886920,890020," There's no guarantee you could ever use it on a PC and quite a good chance you won't"
890020,891020," be able to.\""
891020,895660," The original PSVR is electronically equivalent to a monitor."
895660,898660," So it is relatively simple to get a video signal up on it."
898660,901740," Reading sensors, et cetera, took a lot of reverse engineering and at least a year from"
901740,903380," release before anyone figured that out."
903380,907740," Took a couple more years before it was used as well as a PC VR headset."
907740,908740," Yeah."
908740,912500," And it's still a work in progress with tracking controllers, with the original hardware over"
912500,914960," five years from release."
914960,915960," Wow."
915960,916960," Okay."
916960,919240," Yeah, I wouldn't expect that to be a thing."
919240,920240," Yeah."
920240,921240," Okay."
921240,922240," That's fair enough."
922240,924640," I mean, it's kind of a funny thing to me."
924640,930940," Like if people can use it on the PC and they want to use it on the PC, is there really no"
930940,933080," margin in it at $500?"
933080,935440," Like they couldn't just sell it as a VR headset?"
935440,937840," I guess that wouldn't be very PlayStation of them."
937840,939680," That wouldn't be very Sony of them."
939680,945720," It's sort of, PlayStation's actually been moving a ton of games to PC and has been fairly"
945720,950860," faithful in regards to like patching them and making sure that they actually run okay."
950860,954660," Like when Horizon was one of the earlier games that they brought to PC and it was quite a"
954660,958340," mess when they first brought it over, but they cleaned it up."
958340,962100," And as far as Maron and San Diego is, it's pretty stable now."
962100,965060," So in the past, I would definitely agree with that."
965060,968180," But these days, they've actually been pretty PC friendly."
968180,969180," Okay."
969180,971180," Well, I guess we'll see."
971180,972740," Yeah, I don't know."
972740,975580," Conrad says it's hard to keep customers in your walled garden if you open the door."
975580,977580," I mean, yeah, it's fair enough."
977580,978580," True."
978580,982460," Why don't we jump into our next topic?"
982460,990060," Who wants to pay $144 a year for Facebook after the massive success of Twitter Blue?"
990060,997380," Mark Zuckerberg has his eyes set clearly on generating revenue from his user base through"
997380,1005780," the meta verified program, a monthly subscription with a cost of $12 that does what?"
1005780,1006780," Okay."
1006780,1012500," It covers Facebook and Instagram includes a blue badge, increased search visibility, exclusive"
1012500,1019580," stickers for stories, direct customer support and 100 free stars, a currency that can be"
1019580,1021980," used to tip creators."
1021980,1030660," There does not appear to be any reduction in ads or data mining."
1030660,1032540," What a deal, Mark."
1032540,1033860," Sign me up."
1033860,1036100," I love it."
1036100,1040700," Can we never normalize this?"
1040700,1041700," People."
1041700,1042900," It seems to just be a brand thing."
1042900,1044100," Like never."
1044100,1046420," Can we never, ever normalize this?"
1046420,1050140," Can we always make fun of people for paying for Twitter Blue?"
1050140,1051140," Please."
1051140,1057380," Would you normalize it if it did do what it says at the end?"
1057380,1062500," If it did reduce or let's say it removed ads and removed data mining?"
1062500,1064060," I wouldn't believe them."
1064060,1065860," Yeah, fair enough."
1065860,1066860," All right."
1066860,1070180," Let's imagine that you knew without a doubt that it did."
1070180,1073620," Forget the data mining because I don't believe them."
1073620,1076300," But we can talk about ads."
1076300,1081980," If I never saw an ad on Facebook or Instagram again, I wouldn't pay for this because I don't"
1081980,1085180," remember the last time I opened up Facebook or Instagram."
1085180,1087980," No offense to our dedicated viewers on Facebook."
1087980,1088980," All dozens of you."
1088980,1090220," Yeah, we're streaming there right now."
1090220,1093940," We're streaming there right now."
1093940,1097100," I don't think either of us have ever seen that page."
1097100,1098100," No."
1098100,1100060," 41 people are watching on Facebook."
1100060,1101580," Oh, very nice."
1101580,1102580," Yes."
1102580,1103580," Sup."
1103580,1104580," Boomers."
1104580,1106580," Hello fellow Boomers."
1106580,1111140," They're leaving in shame."
1111140,1112340," And I took that personally."
1112340,1114340," Don't observe us."
1114340,1116980," Yeah, so Facebook."
1116980,1118540," No, I wouldn't pay for it."
1118540,1122580," But let's say, let's say hypothetically that it was a service I actually used and cared"
1122580,1123580," about."
1123580,1124580," Yeah, I don't know."
1124580,1126180," 12 bucks a month doesn't seem that outlandish."
1126180,1127980," Why would you pay for it though as a normal user?"
1127980,1130540," What does it even give you as a company?"
1130540,1132980," Have you seen how many ads there are on Facebook?"
1132980,1133980," Oh, no."
1133980,1135340," So we're not talking about our--"
1135340,1136980," I was talking about the root thing."
1136980,1138540," I was no longer talking about the ad removal."
1138540,1139140," Oh, OK."
1139140,1141260," So we're not talking about the real product."
1141260,1143020," Or we are going back to talking about the real product."
1143020,1144020," We're going back to talking about the real product."
1144020,1150140," Yeah, so increased search visibility, stickers, customer support, and stars to tip creators."
1150140,1152060," It's basically just stars."
1152060,1153060," Yeah."
1153060,1154060," I mean--"
1154060,1155060," If you're a normal user."
1155060,1156060," And then--"
1156060,1157740," What support do you need on Facebook?"
1157740,1160460," So maybe you're not that good with computers."
1160460,1163300," Maybe you just need help using websites?"
1163300,1167220," I interpret that as the other way around."
1167220,1168380," Direct customer support."
1168380,1169580," Yeah, maybe you're all right."
1169580,1172620," Wow, that's an advertised major feature."
1172620,1176740," I mean, if you need customer support, you should just contact them, right?"
1176740,1179660," I assumed that was some way that brands could interface."
1179660,1181140," Yeah, maybe I've got this wrong."
1181140,1183020," Maybe it's completely the other way around."
1183020,1187260," I kind of hope so, because if they're like, hey, yeah, we'll give you customer support"
1187260,1192220," for this thing that you're paying for, I would hope that's not a thing that they advertise."
1192220,1193020," Yeah, guys."
1193020,1194620," I mean, hit us up."
1194620,1197420," Which one is it?"
1197420,1199620," Meta support also means Instagram support."
1199620,1204340," We recently lost a company Instagram account because they don't have support for unverified"
1204340,1205340," users."
1205340,1207740," Yeah, so it sounds like it's very company-focused."
1207740,1209380," No, it sounds like it's user-focused."
1209380,1213700," If you're a user and you lose your account, you should be able to get secure."
1213700,1215980," Yeah, but because it wasn't verified."
1215980,1219260," Well, I mean, just being anyone who lost their account, whether they're a company or an"
1219260,1221660," individual user, would be pretty bummed about it."
1221660,1222660," Sure."
1222660,1223860," That's a contact support."
1223860,1225380," But that's terrible."
1225380,1227300," You should just have support for users."
1227300,1230020," I don't disagree."
1230020,1231220," Unbelievable."
1231220,1233540," This is worse than I thought."
1233540,1235540," And it was already laughable."
1235540,1236380," Man."
1236380,1238380," Shortly after..."
1238380,1240980," Okay, so they're not the first to jump on this."
1240980,1243180," Shortly after Twitter, Blue was launched."
1243180,1247340," Tumblr started selling what they called \"important blue internet checkmarks\" that"
1247340,1251380," officially do absolutely nothing for a one-time cost of $4 each."
1251380,1256460," They apparently made a quarter million dollars in profit, a quarter over quarter increase"
1256460,1262060," of in-app purchases of 125%."
1262060,1266020," As of our recent update, the checkmarks are now rainbow colored apparently."
1266020,1271100," Tumblr user CarpySunz, that is actually, unironically, what I called them when I was"
1271100,1272100," a kid."
1272100,1273100," You know, those little Capri Sun..."
1273100,1274100," I don't know, Portuguese things."
1274100,1279220," I called them CarpySunz because I don't know, I guess I had a little bit of the dyslexia."
1279220,1289300," Anyway, CarpySunz apparently spent $120 on checkmarks, which is amazing."
1289300,1294860," And back to sort of the inspiration for this Twitter, Blue, according to the most recent"
1294860,1300060," available numbers, only about 0.02% of active Twitter users have a paid subscription of any"
1300060,1301500," kind."
1301500,1303620," I would have guessed it would have been somewhat similar."
1303620,1309820," Honestly, if you look at conversion rates for users to external things, like say Patreon,"
1309820,1315500," Flowplane, Nebula, whatever, I think it's actually usually a little higher than that."
1315500,1317860," Yeah, that's because there's no real value."
1317860,1319940," That was for us, but it's blue pixels."
1319940,1323660," But yeah, considering how much you get, compare it, that's probably about where I would have"
1323660,1324660," slapped it."
1324660,1328820," I mean, Flowplane is actually like, we sell it pretty hard these days because it's a pretty"
1328820,1330780," darn good value these days."
1330780,1331780," Yep."
1331780,1337020," But I'm saying like you get a lot if you subscribe to some creators, well, I guess it's up to"
1337020,1338900," what the creator is offering."
1338900,1342260," But a lot of times I see you get a decent amount of value if you subscribe to someone's"
1342260,1344780," Flowplane or Patreon or whatever else."
1344780,1350820," Considering what you're getting for the Twitter, Blue checkmark."
1350820,1356820," How quickly could the Flowplane team make like whale checkmarks because people on Flowplane"
1356820,1358740," are asking for them?"
1358740,1362340," I've got offers for like 15 bucks here."
1362340,1364940," Your already paying."
1364940,1368500," If they want to pay more, Luke, can we get a tier that has a checkmark?"
1368500,1372580," You can subscribe to the supporter plus tier and you get 4K."
1372580,1375460," No, we need supporter plus plus."
1375460,1380060," We have a product the creator warehouse team is working on that has a size that is extra"
1380060,1381060," medium."
1381060,1387340," There's something in between medium and large and we didn't know what to call it."
1387340,1389340," You might fix that before we actually go on."
1389340,1391340," Why do you guys want this?"
1391340,1393340," Oh my goodness."
1393340,1399700," We'll check in if you guys still want it in like a while when we have bandwidth to work"
1399700,1400700," on some of that."
1400700,1401700," When the memes are over."
1401700,1404420," When the meme is dead, I'll check in if you guys still want it and then we'll see"
1404420,1405420," then."
1405420,1408500," Yeah, we'll call it the take my money tier."
1408500,1409500," Yeah."
1409500,1410500," Yeah."
1410500,1411500," It'll have to be whale tier."
1411500,1412860," It'll have to be whale tier."
1412860,1417100," We'll come up with some other stuff that we can bundle in or something like that."
1417100,1420340," I mean, we do care about providing actual value."
1420340,1423220," Like even the whale tickets at LTX."
1423220,1427420," I mean, yeah, it's 10 grand, but it includes like a $5,000 computer."
1427420,1429140," Don't you get a hotel room?"
1429140,1430140," Yeah."
1430140,1431140," Yeah."
1431140,1432140," So there's value in there."
1432140,1433140," We would need to."
1433140,1434620," Yeah, they would have to have value."
1434620,1436700," Yeah, we're just we're."
1436700,1438540," I'm totally down with their be."
1438540,1443420," I mean, this is up to you guys technically, but I'm totally down for there being like more"
1443420,1445060," expensive tiers that are offered."
1445060,1446060," Yeah."
1446060,1447060," The problem is I don't."
1447060,1448060," I don't want waste."
1448060,1451660," Like people are suggesting like free merch every month here."
1451660,1453980," And my problem with that is what if it's something you don't want?"
1453980,1455700," Yeah, we don't want you to throw stuff away."
1455700,1457820," I don't want to ship waste around the world, right?"
1457820,1459260," Like it doesn't do anybody any good."
1459260,1461060," I'd rather you guys just."
1461060,1465020," In general, I usually would say you and I, but I think in general at the company, we"
1465020,1468260," are not into the idea of fast fashion."
1468260,1469260," We're building things to last."
1469260,1474020," You should be able to keep said thing for a while if you have it."
1474020,1477660," You don't want to just create garbage doesn't seem good."
1477660,1481380," I don't think there's an argument for just genuinely creating garbage."
1481380,1484540," Yeah, I just am not that into that."
1484540,1486740," I mean, the main value is the exclusive content."
1486740,1489700," We've got extras from the XQC build."
1489700,1492060," We've got, oh, these are these are really fun."
1492060,1497100," We've done a couple of mini moving vlogs for the move over to the lab."
1497100,1499140," The team is doing such an amazing job."
1499140,1502740," We're doing, I think, at least two exclusives per week."
1502740,1506340," We've got Linus React to Dennis and Vance switching roles."
1506340,1511820," There's an update that is going to be going into beta, which is something we haven't really"
1511820,1516300," done before, but users will be able to opt into beta to be able to use it."
1516300,1519380," It's not out yet, but we're coming relatively soon."
1519380,1523580," That is going to make it so that when you click on, if you go back to Flowplane really"
1523580,1530380," quick, if you clicked on that right there, it would expand downwards and you would be"
1530380,1531980," able to see a bunch of sub-channels."
1531980,1535500," So Mac address and technical key and short circuit and all that stuff."
1535500,1541340," So you'd be able to effectively filter to the channel as if it was on YouTube, but then"
1541340,1547100," there can also be other things like Flowplane exclusive or whatever else."
1547100,1548100," So that's coming."
1548100,1550660," It's a little bit easier because people have brought up that."
1550660,1555540," I mean, you can just type in the search, like, Flowplane exclusive, but people don't like"
1555540,1556500," typing, I guess."
1556500,1559580," So we will bring a new solution."
1559580,1566660," But yeah, oh, also while we're talking about those types of things, merch messages, people"
1566660,1572260," have commented many a time, including I, that you can't do merch messages if you use shop"
1572260,1573260," pay."
1573260,1578500," So if you like, use Shopify fairly actively, it skips past where merch messages in is,"
1578500,1579700," which is pretty annoying for people."
1579700,1580700," And that has been-"
1580700,1583660," So you explain what merch messages are for those of you who are new, merch messages are"
1583660,1584660," down here."
1584660,1585660," Yes."
1585660,1593860," So you can send a message to the show like this, hey, had you decide on Laslo Supernova?"
1593860,1600940," I think Edzel was a fan and got in touch and we had a relationship with Monstercat."
1600940,1608060," And basically, Laslo agreed to do a slightly customized version of the intro song for us"
1608060,1610340," that exactly matched our answer."
1610340,1615420," Laslo agreed to do a slightly customized version of the intro song for us that exactly matched"
1615420,1617180," our animation."
1617180,1622500," And it just, I don't know, was so good and so iconic that we just kind of kept it forever."
1622500,1624540," I mean, I can still jam out to it."
1624540,1626060," And I've heard it so many times."
1626060,1630460," We have stopped using the intro as Dan noted in the response there in every video, but"
1630460,1632700," we do still use it sometimes."
1632700,1636580," The issue is just that if you're throwing away like seven seconds of retention right"
1636580,1638580," at the beginning of the video, there's-"
1638580,1640100," Highly valuable retention too."
1640100,1641100," Yeah."
1641100,1649220," It's just the branding is great, but the effect on viewership of not just that video, but"
1649220,1652260," your entire library is not positive."
1652260,1655540," So it's something that we've started to shy away from."
1655540,1657540," Anyway, what was I talking about?"
1657540,1658540," Merge messages, what they are."
1658540,1659540," Right."
1659540,1661620," Merge messages, what they are is a way to send a message to the show."
1661620,1668420," And if we don't get to it for whatever reason or whatever, at least you get your order in"
1668420,1669420," the mail."
1669420,1675100," So you get a hoodie or a- Oh, do you have a- like a right to repair pin plan?"
1675100,1676100," That's a really good idea."
1676100,1677820," Hey, Dan, do you mind firing that over to Sarah?"
1677820,1678820," Right now."
1678820,1681060," And then maybe, yeah, maybe she could do up something like that."
1681060,1682060," That'd be awesome."
1682060,1687780," Basically, instead of the only thing that you get being a chance for your streamer person"
1687780,1691180," that you're watching to respond- Yeah, and to enrich Google or Amazon."
1691180,1697260," Now you definitely get something and there's a free added bonus that genuinely costs nothing"
1697260,1698660," that we might respond."
1698660,1700660," Yeah, so it's cool."
1700660,1702100," And oh, we launched a new product today."
1702100,1704580," Man, we're getting- okay, we're getting all this out of the way here."
1704580,1705620," Oh, wait, okay."
1705620,1709460," But the clarification there is where it happens has changed."
1709460,1711380," It's in, I believe, the cart now."
1711380,1713020," So everyone can see it all the time."
1713020,1714020," Doesn't matter if you're using shop pay."
1714020,1717260," Doesn't matter if you're wanting to use Apple pay that came up last time, whatever."
1717260,1718460," You can all see it."
1718460,1720020," So it works."
1720020,1721020," Awesome."
1721020,1722660," Love it."
1722660,1724180," And we launched a new desk pad."
1724180,1725780," The WAN desk pad."
1725780,1726780," What?"
1726780,1734060," It's a desk pad, but with a WAN logo and an orange accent and very LTT WAN branded and"
1734060,1735060," all that good stuff."
1735060,1736060," Open the desk configurator."
1736060,1738580," I open the desk configurator."
1738580,1741260," Of course I'm going to open the desk configurator."
1741260,1744580," This allows you to set your desk width, your desk depth."
1744580,1746060," You can set a style."
1746060,1749740," You can see what different sizes of desk pad will look like."
1749740,1752620," You can move them around and go, you know, I'd really like my desk pad to sit something"
1752620,1753780," like this."
1753780,1758300," You can add a monitor."
1758300,1760020," I thought you could add a monitor."
1760020,1762300," Well, there's a keyboard anyway."
1762300,1765940," So you can kind of play around with it and figure out what size makes sense for you."
1765940,1768380," Oh, you got to set a monitor count."
1768380,1770700," Oh, look at that."
1770700,1771700," Too."
1771700,1773180," You can kind of move them around."
1773180,1774180," Look at that."
1774180,1775180," How fun is that?"
1775180,1776180," Everything's to scale."
1776180,1778500," You can check enable rotation and like turn them if you have them."
1778500,1779820," Oh, like an angle."
1779820,1782020," You can really see how your desk is going to look."
1782020,1783020," Whoops."
1783020,1784900," Yeah, well, there's your problem."
1784900,1786620," There's your problem right there."
1786620,1787620," Yeah."
1787620,1788620," Yeah."
1788620,1791300," That was a lot of work, but it's really cool."
1791300,1793100," So that's good."
1793100,1795540," All right."
1795540,1801220," So Luke, are you signing up for Facebook plus or Facebook premium?"
1801220,1802220," What are you even calling it?"
1802220,1803220," Meta verified."
1803220,1805340," Are you signing up for Meta verified?"
1805340,1807020," Is it the new meta?"
1807020,1810020," No, definitely not."
1810020,1811420," And I can't believe it's 12 bucks a month."
1811420,1812420," That's actually insane."
1812420,1814420," I'm like, I guess."
1814420,1819700," Well, I guess, again, it really feels like they're very specifically targeting."
1819700,1822340," Dan, or should I call you moire?"
1822340,1823420," Yeah, that's sweater."
1823420,1825300," That's sweater though."
1825300,1826300," My goodness."
1826300,1829020," Okay, not camera friendly."
1829020,1830020," See you later."
1830020,1835140," No, don't take off your sweater."
1835140,1836980," It's cold in here."
1836980,1839060," Are you signing up for Meta verified?"
1839060,1840060," No."
1840060,1841060," All right."
1841060,1842060," Thanks, Dan."
1842060,1847740," It really, especially with the price, it feels like it's targeted towards customers or people"
1847740,1850700," who want to use Facebook in a professional manner."
1850700,1852180," Yeah, that's fair."
1852180,1853180," Yeah."
1853180,1854500," All right."
1854500,1860420," Let's talk about a little topic that I call I hate building PCs for people."
1860420,1861420," Yeah."
1861420,1862580," Luke."
1862580,1864300," I do too."
1864300,1868620," It really does feel like a no good deed goes on punished kind of situation, doesn't"
1868620,1869620," it?"
1869620,1873460," It does. I like building PCs for specific people."
1873460,1877620," And at this point, I pretty much only build PCs for people that I have built PCs for"
1877620,1878700," in the past."
1878700,1881100," So I know how they will deal with it."
1881100,1882100," Okay."
1882100,1883740," So here's the situation."
1883740,1889540," I built a PC for someone back in, like this can't be right."
1889540,1891100," I think I know."
1891100,1892100," Okay."
1892100,1893100," Well, whatever."
1893100,1894100," It was a while ago."
1894100,1896300," It was a couple months ago or something like that."
1896300,1897300," Okay."
1897300,1898300," I don't think you know who it is."
1898300,1899300," Okay."
1899300,1900300," I don't know who it is."
1900300,1901980," I'm going to be anonymizing it fairly well."
1901980,1903180," Can I see the name?"
1903180,1905580," I mean, sort of."
1905580,1907380," I really don't think it's who you think it is."
1907380,1908380," No clue who that is."
1908380,1909420," That's not who I thought."
1909420,1910420," That's fine."
1910420,1913580," It needs to be completely anonymized."
1913580,1916380," In February, early February, I get a message."
1916380,1921260," I'm just wondering how to get my monitor to 144 Hertz because apparently it's 60 right"
1921260,1922260," now."
1922260,1923260," I kind of go."
1923260,1924580," All right."
1924580,1931180," It was definitely at 144 when I gave it to you, which is all I care about."
1931180,1939380," This is one of those situations where the PC wasn't free, but it was like very not retail."
1939380,1943700," If you know what I mean, like there was, there was, there was some wheeling and dealing"
1943700,1949100," that happened to make sure that this person who was, you know, a family friend definitely"
1949100,1954060," got like something a lot better than they would have walked out of Best Buy with."
1954060,1959020," So, as far as I'm concerned, I have done my good deed all day."
1959020,1960020," Business over."
1960020,1961020," Yeah."
1961020,1964420," Our transaction is now complete."
1964420,1967100," So I kind of go, are you using HDMI or DisplayPort?"
1967100,1969500," HDMI may be stuck at a lower refresh rate."
1969500,1971140," Basic troubleshooting."
1971140,1972300," I don't know what that means."
1972300,1973300," Sorry."
1973300,1974620," How can I check?"
1974620,1977860," And I kind of go, you're going to have to look up how to check."
1977860,1978860," Use Google."
1978860,1979860," Okay."
1979860,1980860," All right."
1980860,1983780," Two weeks later."
1983780,1986900," I've been having problems connecting my headset mic."
1986900,1988420," When I checked, it's not registering."
1988420,1989940," It doesn't say the model of headset."
1989940,1991140," Here I'll show it to you screenshot."
1991140,1993060," I'm like, I don't know."
1993060,1996140," If I was in front of it, I might be able to figure it out, but you might just have to"
1996140,1997780," find some troubleshooting guides."
1997780,2005580," I get no fewer than one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12"
2005580,2013180," messages over the next three days that go as far as."
2013180,2014180," I'm pretty."
2014180,2015180," Okay."
2015180,2018140," I really think this is urgent."
2018140,2019140," Please reply to this quickly."
2019140,2021940," I can't do anything on my PC."
2021940,2032260," And I'm just, I'm sitting here going, what's my incentive to do a favor for anyone at that"
2032260,2033940," point?"
2033940,2036060," You know, like I don't."
2036060,2037420," I want to try."
2037420,2042180," I found a website called let me GPT that for you."
2042180,2043180," Okay."
2043180,2044180," We're going to Luke screen."
2044180,2045180," We're going to Luke screen."
2045180,2046180," Here we go."
2046180,2047180," Here we go."
2047180,2048180," Let's see if it works."
2048180,2049180," Okay."
2049180,2053620," I mean, this is one of those troubleshooting things that is so broad that."
2053620,2058780," I'm just wondering what it's going to say."
2058780,2060580," Sure."
2060580,2061580," Yeah."
2061580,2063580," All right."
2063580,2069020," I mean, this is good troubleshooting so far."
2069020,2071460," Is this Bing or is this chat GPT?"
2071460,2073540," I'm assuming this is chat GPT."
2073540,2074540," Okay."
2074540,2075540," I don't actually know."
2075540,2077460," I've never actually used this website before."
2077460,2080900," I was just thinking like there's got a, it has to exist."
2080900,2082780," And then yeah, it did performing Google."
2082780,2085580," So it must be way."
2085580,2087220," What?"
2087220,2089860," Okay."
2089860,2091180," It's scrolling down."
2091180,2092180," What is this?"
2092180,2095060," What is this bot doing?"
2095060,2100980," It clicks the first hit for you."
2100980,2103660," This is maximum tier snark."
2103660,2105500," I don't know."
2105500,2108500," Wait, it just moves it there."
2108500,2109580," I have to click on it."
2109580,2110700," You have to click it."
2110700,2111700," Amazing."
2111700,2112700," Okay."
2112700,2113700," That makes sense."
2113700,2116500," That would probably violate Google's teas and sees if it actually clicked a link for you."
2116500,2117500," Yeah."
2117500,2118500," Hilarious."
2118500,2119500," All right."
2119500,2125460," Anyway, I feel like this is one of those, am I the thing, right?"
2125460,2130100," For basically just saying, so my response, my response to this wall of text is, sorry,"
2130100,2131860," I really can't dig into issues like this."
2131860,2134580," If there's a problem, you'll have to shut it down for now and take it to a computer"
2134580,2135580," shop."
2135580,2137340," Or you can try and fix it yourself."
2137340,2141620," I didn't have anyone to help me troubleshoot and things usually worked out okay."
2141620,2143140," Tongue smiley face."
2143140,2146140," A little bit of sass on the end."
2146140,2149180," A little bit of unnecessary sass on the end."
2149180,2150180," But here's the thing."
2150180,2153460," I mean, okay, have you, have you read these articles?"
2153460,2158380," And I've heard anecdotally from some, a couple of people I've talked to this about recently,"
2158380,2162500," one who's a teacher and one who worked in an office."
2162500,2166300," And I've read articles about this too, that apparently the younger generation, in spite"
2166300,2172300," of growing up with computers, is entering the workplace with fewer functional computing"
2172300,2173300," skills."
2173300,2177140," They grew up with less computer problems because things worked more often."
2177140,2179660," So that's the thing, right?"
2179660,2182020," Is this just tough love?"
2182020,2183260," That's what I thought I was doing."
2183260,2186340," Like, look, no, if you want to solve this, if you want to play video games, I didn't"
2186340,2188940," want to pry, but is this a younger person?"
2188940,2190180," This is a younger person, yes."
2190180,2191980," So I got that vibe."
2191980,2192980," Yeah."
2192980,2197980," And in that case, I mean, it seems more fair, I don't know."
2197980,2202020," Because I mean, realistically, what do young people even do?"
2202020,2205900," Honestly, you're done, you're done your obligations for the day by like three o'clock."
2205900,2207620," Is that when school ends?"
2207620,2208620," I don't even remember."
2208620,2209620," Yeah."
2209620,2211060," So figure it out."
2211060,2215900," Like I, I'm not trying to be a jerk about it or anything, but that was how I learned."
2215900,2220220," The only reason that I'm doing this today, that I know any of this stuff is because I"
2220220,2225820," was highly motivated to fix my computer because I wanted to play video games."
2225820,2226820," Me too."
2226820,2229500," And it's amazing, right?"
2229500,2234180," Kids can figure out just about anything, just about anything."
2234180,2235460," I'm surprised."
2235460,2236460," Yeah."
2236460,2238300," That first one, they didn't just Google it."
2238300,2241860," Because like my, my monitor's not running at the right refresh rate, whatever is like"
2241860,2243220," super Google."
2243220,2244220," What is HDMI?"
2244220,2245220," Super Google."
2245220,2250460," And I have to confess that the second problem with the headset is probably a more challenging"
2250460,2251460," problem."
2251460,2252460," That's Google."
2252460,2253460," Yeah."
2253460,2257620," But I was already kind of in the wrong frame of mind from being asked what HDMI is."
2257620,2261380," So maybe there was a little bit of snark."
2261380,2262900," But it's also true, right?"
2262900,2270460," Like the reality is that I am highly disincentivized to build computers for people if they're going"
2270460,2275380," to bother me about how they work when it's not an actual problem with the computer."
2275380,2277380," I mean, maybe we need to just pull the audience here."
2277380,2278460," I don't know how to set up polls."
2278460,2279460," I forget."
2279460,2283340," I've got some, some people that I've been like building computers for since like high"
2283340,2288460," school that I still build computers for them whenever they need new ones."
2288460,2292140," They never bother me about pretty much anything."
2292140,2293140," Yeah."
2293140,2295500," They just like, they've never actually built one on their own."
2295500,2298060," And every once in a while it'll be, it'll be like, you know, like three or four years"
2298060,2302700," or maybe a little bit more, but they'll be like, Hey, like, you still down?"
2302700,2304620," I'm like, yeah, sure, whatever."
2304620,2308380," They haven't bugged me since then about that at least."
2308380,2309380," So it's like, yeah, why not?"
2309380,2310580," It doesn't really matter to me."
2310580,2313580," Like if, if we're still going to have the understanding that like you got to maintain"
2313580,2316460," it over the next while, but yeah, I'll put it together for you."
2316460,2317460," I don't mind that."
2317460,2318460," Yeah."
2318460,2322180," Chad is pretty universally aligned on this."
2322180,2324860," I do think don't build computers for family."
2324860,2328340," Don't build computers for friends because every time you do it, you turn into tech support"
2328340,2329580," for it forever."
2329580,2333580," I do think and there used to be a threat on the forum and this would annoy the heck out"
2333580,2336740," of me, which was, yeah, I don't know exactly what it was called."
2336740,2342700," It was something about like, it was called Tales from Tech Support."
2342700,2344420," I've heard that before."
2344420,2345420," Yeah."
2345420,2346420," I think that's what it was."
2346420,2347420," Yeah."
2347420,2348420," I don't remember."
2348420,2349500," I know there was a subreddit for it."
2349500,2352060," There was a threat on the forum all this kind of stuff."
2352060,2355380," That kind of stuff used to bother me because a lot of the stories that would end up in"
2355380,2356380," there."
2356380,2357380," Just mocking people."
2357380,2361220," We're actually just people being like, just gatekeeper-y and losers."
2361220,2362220," Yeah."
2362220,2368980," Like if, like, yeah, okay, don't build computers for family, except it kind of depends."
2368980,2369980," Yeah."
2369980,2371980," Like maybe you should."
2371980,2372980," Yeah."
2372980,2377980," I did one for my parents back in the day and they haven't needed an upgrade since then."
2377980,2378980," You know what's really fun?"
2378980,2387620," There's an NCIX Tech Tips episode where I fix a pin on like a Fennem X3 or something like"
2387620,2393180," the Athlon X3 triple core and that CPU is it."
2393180,2394580," Oh, no, Fennem 720."
2394580,2395580," I don't know, whatever."
2395580,2400380," That CPU is in my parents' computer to this day because it was broken."
2400380,2403140," And I was like, can I just have this?"
2403140,2405100," And they were like, it's a broken CPU."
2405100,2406100," Get out of here."
2406100,2407860," I'm like, okay, cool."
2407860,2409380," So that still works."
2409380,2411180," They don't bother me about it though."
2411180,2413540," I built one for my sister."
2413540,2415780," She also hasn't bothered me about it."
2415780,2418580," Thankfully her hubby is pretty technical though, so she wouldn't really-"
2418580,2419580," And that's like-"
2419580,2420580," And we need to."
2420580,2422580," I will say I have some privilege here because my family's quite technical."
2422580,2423580," Yeah."
2423580,2424580," Like my brother, both very technical."
2424580,2425580," Yeah."
2425580,2429420," But like if my mom has computer problems, I'm going to help my mom with her computer"
2429420,2430420," problems."
2430420,2431420," Yeah, same with my aunt."
2431420,2432420," Like there's-"
2432420,2435980," And I'll like write down on the- all the steps on the piece of paper or I'll record a little"
2435980,2438060," video for her of like how to do it and stuff."
2438060,2441580," Like if this is a family member that you only ever have contact with when they have computer"
2441580,2442580," problems?"
2442580,2443580," That's the worst."
2443580,2444580," That's one thing."
2444580,2446380," That's its own kind of realm."
2446380,2447740," I have one of those."
2447740,2451660," Extended family member who I literally hear from once every year or two when they want"
2451660,2452900," to ask me something about a computer."
2452900,2453900," Yeah, see like that's annoying."
2453900,2454900," Yeah."
2454900,2458020," But if this is a family member that you're in like pretty consistent contact with or like"
2458020,2460540," raised you or whatever else like-"
2460540,2462180," Or tries to help themselves."
2462180,2463180," Yeah."
2463180,2464180," That's a huge part of it."
2464180,2468420," If I don't have to explain the same thing over and over and over again, I have a ton"
2468420,2469420," more patience for it."
2469420,2474260," Or maybe they're super not technical, but they like gave it a shot."
2474260,2475260," Just could have figured it out."
2475260,2476260," They gave it a-"
2476260,2477260," They gave it a-"
2477260,2478260," Yeah."
2478260,2479260," Yeah."
2479260,2480260," And didn't make it worse hopefully."
2480260,2481260," Yeah."
2481260,2482260," Sometimes a problem."
2482260,2483260," Sometimes."
2483260,2483940," But like there's things like that where it's like man, like you just get over it."
2483940,2487060," There's also other ones that I used to find in those threads which were people literally"
2487060,2490660," just complaining about the fact that they had to do a job."
2490660,2492860," Like they were- that used to try me nuts too."
2492860,2495860," They would like be in technical support at a company."
2495860,2498340," And then they'd be like these idiots have computer problems?"
2498340,2501060," Like yeah, it's why you're here."
2501060,2502060," You're welcome."
2502060,2503060," Yeah."
2503060,2504060," Like what do you want?"
2504060,2505980," Like stop complaining."
2505980,2509460," They have like things that they would rather not do at their job as well."
2509460,2510460," I don't know."
2510460,2511700," Those types of things used to bother me."
2511700,2515180," Like don't complain about helping people that help you."
2515180,2516180," Yeah."
2516180,2518180," Like it should be a cyclical thing."
2518180,2524500," If these people like raised you in a not completely terrible way, maybe I'll kind of"
2524500,2525500," get it with that."
2525500,2526500," Yeah."
2526500,2529500," Based on how you turned out, I don't know if you owe them any exact support."
2529500,2530500," Wow."
2530500,2533620," I think I owe them lots."
2533620,2540240," But yeah, like if there's, I don't know, just don't be super salty all the time about"
2540240,2541780," doing good things for people."
2541780,2546300," But if people are just trying to extract value from you and they don't care about you at"
2546300,2549900," all, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, don't deal with that either."
2549900,2550900," Yeah."
2550900,2553740," I think both of them are valid stances."
2553740,2555260," I'm holding the line."
2555260,2559780," I'm basically just going, yep, if I could figure it out, then you can figure it out."
2559780,2563340," And if you can't figure it out, then I already saved you hundreds of dollars."
2563340,2564340," You can get it to a shop."
2564340,2565500," You already did a lot."
2565500,2567100," So I'm over it."
2567100,2568100," Yeah."
2568100,2569100," All right."
2569100,2570100," That's it."
2570100,2571900," Next up."
2571900,2576940," Do you really care that much that I rage quit a video game?"
2576940,2578500," That's a headline topic to you."
2578500,2580780," Yeah, I don't know."
2580780,2581780," Sure."
2581780,2582780," None of these other things interests me."
2582780,2587140," I would have like tried to submit topics, but I was genuinely like getting concerned"
2587140,2590420," part way through the week because I was like, nothing's happening."
2590420,2592260," Nothing's happening at all."
2592260,2595300," What are we going to talk about?"
2595300,2601700," There was like, okay, a minor continuation on the like Microsoft Sony and Activision"
2601700,2606540," Blizzard thing, but like that's been going on for a million years."
2606540,2609620," And I think people barely care until it gets finalized."
2609620,2612580," Like, do they actually get to buy ABK or not?"
2612580,2614460," And it hasn't been finalized yet."
2614460,2618020," So how about Canada Mayforce Google and meta to pay for Canadian news?"
2618020,2619020," Is that interesting?"
2619020,2620820," Because we've already talked about this at least two times."
2620820,2623060," Well, there was when Australia started doing it."
2623060,2624420," We've already talked about Canada."
2624420,2628020," And yeah, okay."
2628020,2630020," I mean, I think it's worth talking about it."
2630020,2631020," We can go into it."
2631020,2633380," Look, I mean, still a maybe though, and it was a maybe like."
2633380,2634380," When writer is right there."
2634380,2635380," Is that her fault?"
2635380,2637740," Are you going to look right at her and not read this?"
2637740,2640100," I can't usually she can't make things exist."
2640100,2644180," You can't like knock on like Nvidia store and be like, hey, do something controversial."
2644180,2646060," What do you think is for the way it show?"
2646060,2647540," Unlaunch a GPU."
2647540,2651820," Like I said, I don't think the writing's bad."
2651820,2652820," Just nothing happened."
2652820,2657580," For a period of five weeks, Google will be testing blocking links to news articles from"
2657580,2661300," appearing in searches for around a million Canadian users."
2661300,2666100," The test is a response to Canada's proposed online news act, which would obligate them"
2666100,2670100," to pay for links to media content that appears in Google searches."
2670100,2673500," Google has described the bill as overly broad."
2673500,2677180," And meta has stated that they might restrict access to news on their own platforms should"
2677180,2681620," the bill pass into law, which is I think what they're trying to do is get people to go"
2681620,2683900," to the original sauce for the news."
2683900,2687500," So mission accomplished, I guess?"
2687500,2689820," Media passed a similar law back in 2021."
2689820,2693260," Back then, Google conducted similar tests and meta restricted links to news articles"
2693260,2694420," on its platforms."
2694420,2698020," Eventually, however, both meta and Google agreed to licensing deals estimated to be"
2698020,2702020," worth at least 200 million Australian dollars annually."
2702020,2703020," We have a note here."
2703020,2706940," Australia's home to Rupert Murdoch, possibly the world's largest news magnate."
2706940,2712180," The meta and Google's of the world might not feel the same pressure to give in to Canada's"
2712180,2713180," demands."
2713180,2714180," We want my money."
2714180,2717020," How about some of that internet money?"
2717020,2718020," Stephen Abutman."
2718020,2725740," Anyway, a spokesperson for the Canadian Heritage Minister described, man, imagine that like"
2725740,2726740," being your job."
2726740,2729260," I'm in charge of Canadian heritage."
2729260,2731340," Like, okay."
2731340,2737340," So what, like HBC and like Canada Goose, like coats, like I don't know."
2737340,2738340," Yeah, I'm sure."
2738340,2739340," Beavers."
2739340,2743700," Describe Google's actions as a threat and said, Canadians won't be intimidated."
2743700,2746940," At the end of the day, all we're asking the tech giants to do is compensate journalists"
2746940,2748860," when they use their work."
2748860,2751620," Complicating matters."
2751620,2757260," It's debatable to what degree meta in particular can be described as using the work of journalists."
2757260,2760260," Links to articles and other news content are typically posted to Facebook and Instagram"
2760260,2765020," by users and often by the journalists themselves."
2765020,2768980," Google could be accused in certain instances of replacing the need to click through to articles"
2768980,2775300," by extracting snippets that directly answer users' questions, but it's hard to say how"
2775300,2777380," exactly that's going to shake out."
2777380,2781020," The government states that regulators will determine which organizations will be required"
2781020,2784420," to negotiate licensing agreements for news content according to principles such as power"
2784420,2788740," imbalance and quasi-monopoly status in a given market."
2788740,2793500," So the discussion question here is, is it reasonable for large platforms to simply not link to"
2793500,2804620," content that they would otherwise have to pay for?"
2804620,2830140," That platform still has any value to them."
2830140,2837820," And then if it is particularly pressing, then what I can do is I can just sort of see what"
2837820,2842580," people are saying about it and read the comments, figure out what at least people..."
2842580,2843580," General sentiment is."
2843580,2846420," Yeah, what general sentiment towards it is."
2846420,2855100," And so just not having any awareness of it at all unless I start actually going to news"
2855100,2859980," media websites, which I don't remember the last time I ever did."
2859980,2863420," Organically, just navigate it directly to a news site."
2863420,2867740," This isn't a super western thing, but there is a decent amount of countries that have"
2867740,2872380," their own news access stuff."
2872380,2877820," I wouldn't be surprised if there was an inside of Canada aggregate for these types of..."
2877820,2879300," Canada inside news."
2879300,2880300," Yeah."
2880300,2881300," The C-B-C."
2881300,2882300," No, that's not..."
2882300,2886220," Just be one of them, but yeah, fair enough."
2886220,2889620," Yeah, I don't know."
2889620,2890620," What are you going to do?"
2890620,2893140," Where will you get your news?"
2893140,2895340," Reddit?"
2895340,2898700," I'm usually happier when I disconnect more from the news."
2898700,2902540," Yeah, that's true."
2902540,2903540," But yeah, I don't know."
2903540,2911700," I've also find that I'm usually happier when I use things like Reddit and other various"
2911700,2915580," attempts to get you to infinite scroll type applications less."
2915580,2918660," So I've just been more and more disconnected moving forward."
2918660,2919660," I don't know."
2919660,2921980," Reddit usually makes me pretty happy."
2921980,2929660," That was a really well-timed phone, but I'm not taking it."
2929660,2930660," No bait."
2930660,2932580," I'm not biting."
2932580,2936020," Let's talk about the first time that I have rage-quitted game."
2936020,2937020," Yeah."
2937020,2939540," I actually think this should be somewhat interesting."
2939540,2947860," I recently purchased an Apple TV and an Apple Arcade subscription for one game."
2947860,2949780," I've talked about it many times on Wanshow."
2949780,2950780," Yes."
2950780,2951780," There's a lot of excitement for this."
2951780,2952780," Yes."
2952780,2953780," And it was the follow-up to what?"
2953780,2961020," It was-- well, it's not a follow-up to anything, but it's a very traditional style RPG, like"
2961020,2968900," JRPG and the team behind it, which includes here Nobu Sakaguchi of Final Fantasy 6 fame,"
2968900,2974340," sort of like one of my favorite games of all time, also Nobu Matsuh."
2974340,2976900," I can't remember how to pronounce this last name, I'm sorry."
2976900,2980340," The composer for basically like every Final Fantasy game ever."
2980340,2986820," So there on it, a bunch of other folks from sort of that era were like, \"Okay, for both"
2986820,2992380," of the two headliners, they're kind of going, 'This could be our last game.'"
2992380,2993820," Let's do it traditional style."
2993820,2997220," It's called Fantasian, and it's Apple Arcade exclusive."
2997220,3002220," I eventually gave up on it ever coming to anything else because I realized, 'Holy crap,"
3002220,3004060," Apple funded the whole thing.'"
3004060,3005740," This wasn't a licensing agreement."
3005740,3009620," They actually just funded the game."
3009620,3012780," It's also just for user context."
3012780,3015660," On the Apple App Store, it is rated 4.7 out of 5."
3015660,3016660," Yep."
3016660,3018580," On RPG site-- I don't know what that is."
3018580,3024060," It's rated 9 out of 10, and then Google users have given the game a rating of 94 percent--"
3024060,3026180," or 94 percent of users liked the game."
3026180,3028340," I guess it's a rotten tomato style."
3028340,3031180," And it's absolutely beautiful."
3031180,3035900," So the environments are actually done in dioramas."
3035900,3038820," These are all miniatures."
3038820,3045420," And then the characters and elements of the game that you can interact with, like chests,"
3045420,3052260," even the fight environments are all done in diorama form, it is gorgeous."
3052260,3053260," It's utterly unique."
3053260,3054260," Is this an actual diorama?"
3054260,3055260," Yes."
3055260,3056260," And then you have digital characters that move around it?"
3056260,3060180," But then they scan it, and then digital characters move around with it."
3060180,3061180," It's pretty cool."
3061180,3062180," Yeah, it's beautiful."
3062180,3064780," It's a cool idea."
3064780,3067100," It definitely has some problems."
3067100,3073980," I wouldn't say that it takes a particularly enlightened approach to its female characters."
3073980,3079140," So for better or for worse, it's a very traditional JRPG."
3079140,3084180," But that's, frankly speaking, not what put me off of it."
3084180,3088660," What put me off of it was the fact that it was mobile first."
3088660,3094500," Now, you might be wondering, if that was the issue, why did I put over 30 hours into"
3094500,3096220," it?"
3096220,3097420," And that's a fair question."
3097420,3099740," Well, you were pretty dedicated, right?"
3099740,3103820," You bought, you were excited for it for a long time, and you bought the whatever it was."
3103820,3106300," I bought hardware in order to play it."
3106300,3109140," But the problem is not anything to do with controls."
3109140,3110900," It had full support for controller."
3110900,3111900," Everything was perfect."
3111900,3115540," And I actually spent the vast majority of my time playing it, or actually all of my time,"
3115540,3118220," because that was where the Apple TV is, in the theater."
3118220,3124180," So I was playing on a big screen, no problems."
3124180,3128100," But I reached about the midpoint of the game."
3128100,3129460," I think it's late in part one."
3129460,3133140," I mean, I don't know, because I am never going to finish the game."
3133140,3140380," I reached the point where the boss fights started to become hideously unfair."
3140380,3144660," And the vibe that I'm getting is whether this is because it was designed for mobile"
3144660,3150700," to keep you playing endlessly so that you'll keep your Apple Arcade subscription, or whether"
3150700,3157380," it's because it was designed for an all-you-can-eat platform instead of to be sold for $59.99"
3157380,3164220," or $69.99 on a platform like Nintendo Switch, where they'll actually get an enormous amount"
3164220,3169100," of revenue that's really easily attributable to this game."
3169100,3174820," Or whether it's because Apple just doesn't really understand gaming and didn't invest"
3174820,3179780," money in certain critically important aspects of the development process."
3179780,3185700," Whatever the reason is, the game basically falls apart in terms of difficulty curve."
3185700,3187020," And it's not just difficulty."
3187020,3188940," I don't mind playing a difficult game."
3188940,3191900," I don't mind sitting in a boss fight for 45 minutes."
3191900,3197580," But what finally made me just put down the controller, turn off the system, and walk"
3197580,3206260," out of the room, was this fight with some spirit wolf thing or something like that, that basically"
3206260,3214200," I kid you not, you can be half an hour, 40 minutes into the fight, and just with a couple"
3214200,3222700," of bad RNGs at a non-progression bug essentially."
3222700,3225380," Because one of its abilities, okay, so it's got a few abilities."
3225380,3229340," First of all, a problem with the game in general is that your party is three."
3229340,3235580," Which means that if anyone gets knocked, it is now two turns to be back to health."
3235580,3242540," Which is a full cycle of your buffs wearing out and their debuffs wearing out, where you"
3242540,3243540," cannot do anything."
3243540,3244540," So you have to like reset it."
3244540,3245540," Right?"
3245540,3250020," Plus, whenever anyone gets knocked, not only do they lose any buffs, but they also get knocked"
3250020,3252540," in terms of their turn position."
3252540,3253620," So they lose a turn."
3253620,3257460," You can't just pick them right back up and then go, okay, but they get a turn now they"
3257460,3261060," can heal and you're back in the fight."
3261060,3267260," So this particular boss has a one two, where it can knock one of your characters, then"
3267260,3269300," take another action."
3269300,3272500," That other action can be to summon minions."
3272500,3277300," Those minions then get turns right away before you can pick up that knocked character, where"
3277300,3278740," they can also summon minions."
3278740,3285980," I believe it can summon up to nine total minions and then randomly that boss, not randomly,"
3285980,3290900," but every once in a while and it does seem to be a little bit RNG, it can cast a barrier"
3290900,3295260," spell on itself that takes 20 hits to wear down."
3295260,3299100," Now what's really interesting about this barrier spell is that when it casts it, it"
3299100,3303260," casts it on itself and all minions at the same time."
3303260,3305660," Now you have your attacks like cleave everything."
3305660,3308220," You have multi hit attacks."
3308220,3313060," The most you can do is eight, but in that fight, one of the characters is locked."
3313060,3315860," So normally you can actually cycle your characters during a fight."
3315860,3320780," There's so many cool game mechanics, like the ability to use your entire RPG party in"
3320780,3325620," one fight is super cool and there isn't like a turn weight penalty to it or anything like"
3325620,3326620," that."
3326620,3330980," You can just use your entire party in any combination you want in any battle, which is kind of awesome."
3330980,3335420," If one of them gets knocked, you can't swap them until you get brought up."
3335420,3336420," Yeah."
3336420,3341660," And so I can see why they make you wait after someone's res because otherwise that would"
3341660,3343380," be a super cheap move or whatever else."
3343380,3347780," But honestly, the boss fights are so long that I don't know."
3347780,3350380," I'm pretty sure they could have balanced it if they really wanted to."
3350380,3356460," Anyway, the point is that you have one character that can hit for eight and that character is"
3356460,3360020," not the one that you are locked to in that fight."
3360020,3364980," So you must have at least these two and then you can essentially swap out the other one"
3364980,3368460," and then the most you can do with anyone else is maybe three or four and one go."
3368460,3371940," And that would be to sometimes multiple targets, sometimes to a single target, but that eight"
3371940,3373580," one is a single target."
3373580,3377380," Now you can only do that obviously if you haven't been, haven't had someone one hit"
3377380,3380020," it and then have to spend a cycle picking them up."
3380020,3382740," How often does this one shot happen and is it avoidable?"
3382740,3384380," Pretty often no, it's not avoidable."
3384380,3386260," And you were asking about cleaving the barrier."
3386260,3388500," The answer is no."
3388500,3390180," You cannot eliminate the barrier."
3390180,3395580," You can cast barrier that will absorb up to five hits, but most enemy attacks other than"
3395580,3399860," just like a basic strike will will eliminate your barrier."
3399860,3401900," It'll absorb some damage, but it'll be gone."
3401900,3405420," So it's it's an imbalanced barrier mechanic."
3405420,3411700," It can cast it as far as I can tell whenever it wants on its entire supporting party."
3411700,3414620," And so what happened was I knew about the barrier thing."
3414620,3419300," I knew that it could hit itself and the other wolves around it, but I'd had pretty good luck"
3419300,3423620," clearing out the crowd and making sure that it couldn't hit a large enough crowd with"
3423620,3424620," this barrier thing."
3424620,3426540," And then finally, I like I lost this."
3426540,3429820," I lost it a couple of times, even though I am at the recommended level."
3429820,3432940," And finally, I had one where it actually cast barrier."
3432940,3435020," I should have taken a picture of it because it would have been kind of funny to show"
3435020,3441140," you, but it's this entire army of completely invulnerable opponents until I can hit them"
3441140,3443340," each 20 times."
3443340,3445460," And I'm just sitting here going."
3445460,3450980," If they play tested this at all, that's not fun."
3450980,3452220," That's not fair."
3452220,3453660," There are strategies you can use."
3453660,3455780," Like I looked it up old school style, right?"
3455780,3457060," Okay, how do I beat this boss?"
3457060,3460980," And it's like, oh, okay, this one character has an ability that if you happen to invest"
3460980,3464540," in that branch in the tech tree and you've played around with it, you'll know can be useful"
3464540,3465540," for this."
3465540,3467060," And it's like a like a vacuum."
3467060,3470580," It's like a suction ability that takes all the enemies and puts them in one place so that"
3470580,3472020," your multi-hisc-"
3472020,3475140," So your targets so that it essentially you can hit them all in one go."
3475140,3477060," But even that didn't solve it because I cheesed it."
3477060,3479980," I looked it up and I was like, okay, I'm going to use vacuum."
3479980,3481940," But now I must have a fixed party."
3481940,3485980," I have to have the guy that's locked, the guy that can actually hit for multiple hits."
3485980,3494060," And then I have to have vacuum buddy who's essentially a chemist, which is like fine,"
3494060,3495500," but not great DPS."
3495500,3498980," And oh, yeah, did I mention the boss has like a ton of health."
3498980,3501580," So it's going to be a long fight no matter what you do."
3501580,3503180," So you can so you can cheese it with this."
3503180,3506020," But guess what vacuum doesn't have a hundred percent hit rate."
3506020,3513140," So even when I cheesed it, I missed like three of them on a vacuum and then it cast barrier."
3513140,3516060," And at that point it's unbeatable."
3516060,3521540," I'm sitting here going, well, okay then there's another cheese you can do."
3521540,3524180," Apparently one of the guys has like a payback capability."
3524180,3527420," So if he takes a bunch of damage, he can pay it back."
3527420,3531260," But that just counts on you managing to crowd control and stay alive long enough."
3531260,3535900," Now the obvious solution to this grind a few levels."
3535900,3540340," Once again, which is why you think it feels like it was incentivizing staying on the subscription."
3540340,3542260," Oh, gets worse than that."
3542260,3547260," Once again, the mobile subscription nature of the game rears its ugly head, but this"
3547260,3551340," time because it was intended as a as a multi part release, right?"
3551340,3552340," Like I waited."
3552340,3554380," I'm like, I'm not playing part one then part whatever."
3554380,3555380," I want to know how many parts there are."
3555380,3557620," And I want to sit down and I want to play them one go."
3557620,3562260," But because I'm apparently getting close to the end of part one, what happens is the"
3562260,3565020," leveling curve changes."
3565020,3571980," And the experience that you gain for fighting sort of this tier in this version of the world,"
3571980,3575500," this part enemies goes dramatically down."
3575500,3580780," So if I was to try to grind it, I could be playing for hours and hours and hours just"
3580780,3584540," to do a little bit more damage against this thing."
3584540,3588180," And the problem isn't even that I'm not doing enough damage."
3588180,3592060," Like that might help with crowd control a little bit and okay, it could make it beatable."
3592060,3597180," But the real problem is that this is an utterly imbalanced fight and that's it's not fair."
3597180,3600740," Guys, he didn't mean cheesing because he was using characters abilities."
3600740,3602780," He meant cheese and because he looked up how to do it on the."
3602780,3603780," Yeah."
3603780,3604780," Yeah, that's cheesy."
3604780,3605780," I like figuring things out."
3605780,3606780," Like there's one."
3606780,3612340," Okay, there's one boss that also is pretty pretty gross."
3612340,3618540," It gets to cast poison on you every single turn, not it's turn, every turn."
3618540,3620340," It gets to cast poison on you."
3620340,3625860," So unless you happened to get a bunch of like poison resist stones that you can equip or"
3625860,3630660," whatever else, you are poisoned literally the entire time."
3630660,3633780," And there are other things you might want to equip that aren't poison and at that stage"
3633780,3638900," in the game, you can only have one of these gems for each of your characters."
3638900,3640540," But you know, I figured it out."
3640540,3645820," I figured out that you can block poison with that barrier spell."
3645820,3646900," It'll block poison."
3646900,3649380," So at least my entire party wouldn't be poisoned all the time."
3649380,3651140," Just whoever got their barrier knocked down."
3651140,3653660," Like, okay, fine, you know, I can work around that."
3653660,3657340," But when there's a one hit that is and it's like a way overkill one hit."
3657340,3662060," Like there's no amount of leveling up that would make it not a one hit anymore."
3662060,3663340," It's just not fun."
3663340,3666660," I don't want to just sit and res and just use Phoenix downs."
3666660,3673260," I find completely random one hit mechanics to be very lazy game design in my opinion."
3673260,3678820," Unless there's, you know, things that you can do, then it's fine."
3678820,3679820," And there isn't."
3679820,3680820," Yeah."
3680820,3686660," Like there's another one where I had to look this one up too, where you can blind it."
3686660,3688500," And there's like some gaze move that it uses."
3688500,3689500," But at least there were hints."
3689500,3695260," Like I looked it up and I was like, okay, that kind of makes sense or something."
3695260,3696260," Yeah."
3696260,3698180," If you blinded it can't use its gaze ability."
3698180,3703660," But this one, as far as I can tell, it's just immune to everything and one hits you and"
3703660,3708140," casts barrier on everything."
3708140,3711860," Kuzen Chik says, honestly, it feels like Linus doesn't play many Japanese games."
3711860,3713660," The problem is not the difficulty."
3713660,3718620," The problem is the unfunness of the way that the fight is balanced."
3718620,3723020," And what's really frustrating is I feel like they were almost a victim of their own ambition"
3723020,3727860," here because a lot of the game is really creative."
3727860,3733700," They've done an incredible job of making boss fights not just feel like a grind in a lot"
3733700,3735540," of cases."
3735540,3739980," And even the random battles, they've got this awesome mechanic where random battles do hit"
3739980,3741300," you randomly."
3741300,3746660," But you can enable this device that you carry called a dimension that will absorb anywhere"
3746660,3750740," from 10 to 5 random encounters."
3750740,3751740," And then you fight them all at once."
3751740,3752740," Oh, it piles them all up."
3752740,3753740," And I'm not sure about that."
3753740,3754740," That actually sounds super cool."
3754740,3759140," Yeah, so you get way more time to just experience the environments."
3759140,3761100," And then the fight is probably like really epic."
3761100,3766260," And the fight is actually way more fun, especially because so many of the abilities can be chained"
3766260,3770060," or can pierce or can be curved and arched and stuff."
3770060,3774900," Like it's actually really fun when it's really fun."
3774900,3779820," It's just that it's obvious that it didn't get proper QA."
3779820,3785940," Because when you reach a non-progression, I consider a non-progression point."
3785940,3794500," If your whole party is up and all that happened was you had an ability that RNG didn't grab"
3794500,3796340," enough of those guys."
3796340,3800700," And it just can RNG cast this ability that completely ends it."
3800700,3802780," And you're like half an hour into a stupid fight."
3802780,3804580," Lots of bad game design."
3804580,3807940," And Korean games expect you to farm."
3807940,3808940," Sure."
3808940,3811180," But I can't even farm."
3811180,3813180," Because the curve is so low at that point?"
3813180,3814180," Yeah."
3814180,3815180," That's the core problem."
3815180,3816860," Yeah, so I can't just grind."
3816860,3818860," Yeah, because the curve is so low."
3818860,3819860," Okay."
3819860,3822020," Like I don't even mind grinding once in a while."
3822020,3823740," Like that, okay, so that's another issue."
3823740,3826220," Is there was another one I ran into which is in this place."
3826220,3828940," For those of you who have played it, as far as I can tell, not many people have."
3828940,3830500," There's not a lot of discussion about it."
3830500,3834380," But there's a section called the Triangle of Calamity that I accidentally wandered into"
3834380,3835380," at some point."
3835380,3836380," Sounds cool."
3836380,3837380," I didn't think there was a way to get out of it."
3837380,3841620," I had to look that up as well because I ran into a boss fight there where even after spending"
3841620,3846940," like an hour or two, just grinding, just leveling up."
3846940,3853580," Because the issue there was that one of my characters who I really needed because their"
3853580,3858980," abilities are the weakness of the boss or whatever was way lower because I rescued her"
3858980,3861220," way later in the time when the party splits up."
3861220,3864220," Anyway, the point is I did a bunch of grinding there."
3864220,3868980," And that was when I figured out that the higher level ones were basically not moving anymore."
3868980,3871420," These lower ones were leveling up."
3871420,3876620," But I went into this fight and I also couldn't win that one even with grinding because it"
3876620,3880380," also had a cheap mechanic where it splits into three of itself."
3880380,3883300," And it's randomized, which ones do what."
3883300,3888260," And so if you happen to hit it with an ability that marks it so you can taunt them, if you"
3888260,3891820," happen to hit it before it splits, then you can tell which one is real."
3891820,3896580," But if you don't and you hit them, they hit you super hard to the point where it's like"
3896580,3900140," one or two turns wasted in order to pick up a guy against."
3900140,3901580," It's ridiculous."
3901580,3908060," So I went straight from that one over to the other one and this barrier thing."
3908060,3912620," I was looking at nine wolves with 20 hit barriers on it and I'm just like, I don't even want"
3912620,3913620," to play anymore."
3913620,3914620," Yeah, I don't even want to play anymore."
3914620,3917100," You might be able to get through this, but it's just like, oh man."
3917100,3918460," Yeah, why am I bothering?"
3918460,3919460," This isn't fun."
3919460,3927420," And that's one of the reasons why I actually like FTL so much is that the final boss fight,"
3927420,3934500," it's very satisfying because like there's three stages to it and in between every stage,"
3934500,3939100," it's a spaceship game, in between every stage, the boss will like warp away."
3939100,3943260," So you kind of have a second to like lick your wounds and get everything kind of back"
3943260,3947860," in order, but you can't like travel because it's going to come right back and you're trying"
3947860,3949100," to defend this base."
3949100,3950100," Right."
3950100,3954460," So you have enough time to like if there's literally like fires and holes on or in your"
3954460,3956620," ship, you can like patch it up."
3956620,3959300," Yeah, the plantation has a boss that's like that."
3959300,3963860," It's running away from you and you can kind of take if you wait too long to start attacking"
3963860,3967180," it and like catching up to it, then it like gets away."
3967180,3969660," But if you don't wait too long, you do have a little bit of time."
3969660,3971820," Take care of yourself for a second and reengage."
3971820,3972820," Yeah."
3972820,3973820," I think that's really cool."
3973820,3980740," The ways that the fight evolves over time as you fight it is interesting."
3980740,3984940," I have always wanted like an FTL to come out."
3984940,3988380," Instead, they worked on another game called Into the Breach, which was cool."
3988380,3991380," I'm not particularly super into it, but it's cool."
3991380,3994420," I do hope that they make another iteration of it at some point."
3994420,4001860," I've always wanted it to there's if I remember correctly, there's eight zones in the game,"
4001860,4004300," the eighth zone being where the boss is."
4004300,4008940," I kind of wish at the end of every zone, there was like a mini boss of some sort."
4008940,4010740," I think that would be cool."
4010740,4012820," But yeah, I don't know."
4012820,4016900," CW says LTT is the only channel I've ever seen that claims they can't read Super Chat."
4016900,4018540," Sounds like a loadable to me."
4018540,4020540," We've shown screenshots of it lots of times."
4020540,4021620," The dashboard didn't work."
4021620,4025940," It actually does work now, but I'm just over it at this point."
4025940,4026940," Yep."
4026940,4028340," There you go."
4028340,4031780," If you super chat, it'll show up at the top thing for people that are watching on YouTube."
4031780,4033780," Yeah, so that'll be cool."
4033780,4035980," FTL is really well balanced."
4035980,4041340," Yeah, there's I mean, like with pretty much any game, there's things that are stronger"
4041340,4043020," and there's things that are weaker."
4043020,4046300," But I personally find the balance enough to be able to be fantastic."
4046300,4050420," And I really like how with all the different ships and stuff, you can have these really"
4050420,4054220," interesting different fields to the run that you take."
4054220,4055420," Okay, here we go."
4055420,4058500," Citizen Bean posts on floatplane, straight from Reddit."
4058500,4063460," Like excuse me, 20 barriers, question mark, question mark, a basically guaranteed instant"
4063460,4068300," death attack, 10 plus allies on the battlefield at once that can all receive 20 barriers."
4068300,4072900," This fight is a total cluster and even with Arrowrain plus Samadare to try to handle the"
4072900,4075500," barriers is still ridiculous."
4075500,4080660," Yeah, those mechanics don't sound fun to me."
4080660,4085460," Like I tried every possible combination of things to try to break the barrier."
4085460,4087340," If you could break the barrier, no problem."
4087340,4088460," Let's go."
4088460,4092300," But an unbreakable 20 hit barrier is just stupid."
4092300,4096580," I always hate if you're playing like some type of MMO or even just like, there's a bunch"
4096580,4101740," of these like like four player RPGs and there's a boss fight and the boss has an ability where"
4101740,4104460," it just like targets one of your party members at random."
4104460,4108020," It's like you're dead in 10 seconds."
4108020,4112700," It's like, okay, I guess I'll do what I can for 10 seconds and then just not be able to"
4112700,4113700," play the game."
4113700,4115700," Like this isn't a fun mechanic."
4115700,4120300," You can please like try to find some other way to add difficulty to this fight."
4120300,4121420," I don't know what it is."
4121420,4122620," You can split the party."
4122620,4126180," Like there's interesting things that you can do to reduce the amount of party members."
4126180,4130540," But when you take two one or two party members, don't just kill them."
4130540,4132220," Put them in like a different scenario."
4132220,4135900," Make it so that there's like some hallway they have to they get like teleported back"
4135900,4136900," or something."
4136900,4140100," I have to solo fight through this hallway and to regain with the party or whatever it"
4140100,4141100," is."
4141100,4142100," I don't know."
4142100,4143100," There's other things that you can do."
4143100,4145660," But like Twitch chats having a pretty good moment over here asking if I tried us."
4145660,4151780," You flexing the boss or casting vanish and doom."
4151780,4152780," You know what?"
4152780,4153780," Yeah, sure."
4153780,4156900," There might be like a bugged way to beat it, but I'd rather not play a game than do that"
4156900,4157900," quite honestly."
4157900,4158900," Yeah."
4158900,4159900," Yeah."
4159900,4162700," So yeah, it just I don't know."
4162700,4166500," It made me really sad because it was a game I really wanted to play and I feel like it"
4166500,4172540," was it was doomed to not be as good as it could be because of what it is and because"
4172540,4173740," of how it was funded."
4173740,4174740," Oh, okay."
4174740,4179180," So I was going to say if you had to pick one or the other, do you think it's more the funding"
4179180,4180980," lack of time, lack of QA?"
4180980,4181980," Absolutely."
4181980,4184100," So you don't think it's more the mobile design?"
4184100,4186540," No, the creativity was so high."
4186540,4190780," The mobile issue is well, they're they're part and parcel, right?"
4190780,4196180," It's built for the subscription model where revenue cannot be easily attributed to that"
4196180,4197900," title, right?"
4197900,4204620," So yes, you can see playtime, but that doesn't necessarily tell you and and like, I don't"
4204620,4208260," know how many people are subscribed to Apple Arcade, right?"
4208260,4213300," I suspect that it's a lot less than this would have sold if it had come out as a dedicated"
4213300,4215500," release for Switch in terms of revenue."
4215500,4220460," I mean, these are these are industry legends and I would have bought it for those on Switch"
4220460,4227500," and the demand for, you know, traditional style JRPGs, warts and all is pretty high."
4227500,4232180," Like you look at the number of kind of smaller indie games that are that are sort of chasing"
4232180,4236420," that that older sort of SNES era style, right?"
4236420,4244580," Like there's a couple that are on my to play list that I am super excited about."
4244580,4247820," But it was it was an utter it was an utter disappointment."
4247820,4248820," This one."
4248820,4249820," That is sad."
4249820,4260460," Game development is hard."
4260460,4263460," I was really enjoying it."
4263460,4266460," Music's so good."
4266460,4271100," Like just everything about it was awesome."
4271100,4274700," I know you sort of already answered this, but if you had some way to just delete that boss,"
4274700,4277540," would you do it and then keep pushing forward?"
4277540,4283500," If they had had enough people play through this, they would have found this error."
4283500,4285300," It's an error."
4285300,4286300," Like it is."
4286300,4291500," With how their development path went, they might have had to crunch really super hard"
4291500,4295340," to get that first act out and had bad QA because of it."
4295340,4296540," Yeah, that's what I suspect."
4296540,4300340," And then but they might not have had to crunch as hard for the further acts."
4300340,4305180," Yeah, maybe thunderclash says some of the bosses are ridiculously hard to the point that"
4305180,4309300," here in Obusakiguchi had to release videos in his channel showing how to beat some bosses."
4309300,4310300," Oh, wow."
4310300,4315540," I mean, as long as there are hints, you know, in the gameplay that tell you, then fine,"
4315540,4317260," you know, okay, I had to look it up."
4317260,4318340," I don't mind."
4318340,4322380," I would rather like if I can't figure out how to beat something in a game, which happens"
4322380,4329140," and I have to look it up, I would rather I look it up and go like, Oh, yeah, I'm stupid."
4329140,4330140," Yeah."
4330140,4334180," Instead of I look it up and I go, there's no possible way I would ever."
4334180,4335180," Never forget that."
4335180,4339020," You were supposed to look at the symbol in the bottom left hand corner on the bottom"
4339020,4341820," of the physical box when you took it home."
4341820,4344060," Like, no, I don't screw off."
4344060,4350580," Yeah, I looked up two things in Breath of the Wild in like some in the cult headquarters."
4350580,4353020," I looked up how to get through this wall."
4353020,4354260," I was stuck in this room."
4354260,4356100," There's this like stealth section."
4356100,4357100," And did you play Breath of the Wild?"
4357100,4358620," You know, you never part of it."
4358620,4359620," You didn't finish it."
4359620,4363700," I adopted it as my I'm going to play this on planes game."
4363700,4364700," And then travel stopped."
4364700,4365700," I get it."
4365700,4366700," Yes."
4366700,4367700," Cool."
4367700,4368700," Okay."
4368700,4373020," So anyway, you there's this like stealth section and I would get to the end room."
4373020,4376460," I'm like, this has to be this has to be where I couldn't figure out where to go."
4376460,4378780," And then I so I finally have to screw it."
4378780,4384660," I felt like an idiot because you just have to switch to like your sheke something something."
4384660,4388580," Anyway, one of the walls is magnetic and you can move it or something or you can throw"
4388580,4389580," a thing through."
4389580,4390580," I can't remember you can blow it up."
4390580,4391580," I don't remember."
4391580,4396180," I had just turned on like it's like it would be like playing Batman Arkham Asylum, not"
4396180,4399580," being able to figure out what to do and not using detective vision or whatever."
4399580,4400580," Right?"
4400580,4401900," Like just felt like an idiot."
4401900,4402980," I don't mind stuff like that."
4402980,4407180," It's way easier to absorb because I can deal with just me being dumb."
4407180,4413220," But the second thing I looked up in Breath of the Wild is like some it was some quest"
4413220,4419340," or something where you have to find the thing between the thing that looks like a thing."
4419340,4422980," And I found somewhere in the game that matched the description perfectly."
4422980,4426940," And you know how big that game world is."
4426940,4432340," And so I spent all this time like wandering around there just like fighting things and"
4432340,4435700," looking for I forget if it was a chest or an entrance to a thing."
4435700,4436860," We actually played this game either."
4436860,4441340," But I do know all the things you're talking about so far because I had to benchmark it."
4441340,4442340," Right."
4442340,4446980," And I had to find like a benchmarking section and eventually there was this like room that"
4446980,4451540," you could fight in that would spawn exactly consistent enemies in exactly consistent positions."
4451540,4454820," And you could do the exact set of moves against them every time it worked fine."
4454820,4456580," So I remember that."
4456580,4457860," Wait from Breath of the Wild?"
4457860,4459500," No Arkham Asylum."
4459500,4460740," Oh Arkham Asylum."
4460740,4461740," Oh okay."
4461740,4463500," Yeah no no I'm not talking about Breath of the Wild again."
4463500,4464500," Oh okay."
4464500,4468420," Yeah so there's this like quest you have to be like on a mountain and it has to be night"
4468420,4470460," and it has to be this and it has to be that or something."
4470460,4473060," And I found a spot that actually matches the description."
4473060,4476340," So I had to look that one up and I was like I wasn't even mad about that one."
4476340,4478940," I was mad at myself about the stupid hideout though."
4478940,4480420," Yeah super mad."
4480420,4483260," Yeah I giga clan hideout or whatever it is."
4483260,4485140," Try the demo see what you think."
4485140,4488380," If you're talking about Breath of the Wild I've played a decent amount of it and I enjoyed"
4488380,4489380," it."
4489380,4493220," I just I don't know my brain never shifted to like hey I guess we should play this not"
4493220,4494220," on planes."
4494220,4497180," Because my whole thing was like I'm enjoying this but I don't want to like sprint through"
4497180,4498180," the game."
4498180,4500340," I'm just going to play it when I'm on planes and then we're good."
4500340,4504340," Because I would notice like oh I have an eight hour flight start playing Breath of the Wild."
4504340,4507020," Like I've still just barely started playing and I land."
4507020,4509340," And I'm like oh this is great."
4509340,4510580," I want to keep this superpower."
4510580,4511580," I don't want to finish it."
4511580,4513500," MKirsh asks I think I know what you're talking about."
4513500,4515260," Is it the one from a crossover with another game?"
4515260,4516420," I think so."
4516420,4517420," I think it is."
4517420,4518900," Oh that's kind of annoying."
4518900,4523660," Yeah this is a really good comment from Kornosian over on float plane."
4523660,4525660," If you could delete the boss."
4525660,4529020," If the game gets to the point where the only way to advance is to actually cheat the game"
4529020,4532500," instantly stops being fun for me because I know if it gets inconvenient again I'll"
4532500,4533500," just cheat again."
4533500,4534500," I don't want to cheat."
4534500,4536260," I want to play the game."
4536260,4537820," I want to play the game right?"
4537820,4539620," I don't want to just put in cheat codes."
4539620,4541580," That's not fun for me."
4541580,4545220," It's kind of like oh man I mean it's like anything."
4545220,4547100," It's like in sports right?"
4547100,4552900," Like if it's if the only way to continue to play is to just cheat."
4552900,4553900," Are you playing?"
4553900,4554900," Are you competing?"
4554900,4557380," Are you what's the point even anymore then?"
4557380,4563340," This whole cheating thing has been a fairly major conversation in my circles for a bit"
4563340,4564340," now."
4564340,4566540," And we talked about this."
4566540,4572020," Yeah you were going to talk about so like he quit Tarkov."
4572020,4573660," What the f*** you quit Tarkov?"
4573660,4574660," Yeah it's weird."
4574660,4576780," I've been playing this game for six years."
4576780,4577780," Yeah I know."
4577780,4578780," Yeah."
4578780,4582020," And so he just like messaged me on Discord just like out of nowhere yeah I quit Tarkov."
4582020,4583020," I'm like yeah."
4583020,4584500," Aye I don't believe you."
4584500,4585500," And B what?"
4585500,4586500," Really?"
4586500,4587500," Like quit for now."
4587500,4590860," No I believe you now that you explained why but like yeah let's talk about that."
4590860,4596180," So Tarkov is made by a developer called BSG."
4596180,4601180," And it's a really fantastic game because like okay so I know some people aren't going"
4601180,4602260," to like firearms."
4602260,4607180," My grandpa was a Marine and then he got into the police force afterwards."
4607180,4610860," He used to train me doing drills down in Arizona all the type and stuff."
4610860,4618260," So Tarkov's customization level with firearms is completely a feature for him a bug for"
4618260,4619260," me."
4619260,4622380," It's completely unquestionably unmatched."
4622380,4626460," Like it's absolutely wild the degree that they went to."
4626460,4630180," All these different systems that they have in the game the medical systems are really"
4630180,4631900," just amazing."
4631900,4633220," There's all these different components."
4633220,4638620," The fact you can get like hit in a particular spot and have to use a particular kind of"
4638620,4639820," first aid like."
4639820,4644020," Yeah like you can have there's different types of bleeds and you need different types"
4644020,4646700," you need a certain type of bandage for like a light bleed."
4646700,4651260," You need things like a cat for a heavy bleed something like that."
4651260,4655540," There's all these it's a it's a the game has an insane amount of depth."
4655540,4660700," I've played Eve online and the depth in Tarkov feels like it like competes with it really"
4660700,4661700," heavily."
4661700,4664700," And yet it still has that action that shooter action."
4664700,4667940," Yeah there's really really intense moments like this."
4667940,4668940," It feels extremely unique."
4668940,4673620," There's a few games that have tried to come out and be escaped from Tarkov but like more"
4673620,4674620," for normies."
4674620,4676380," And it's not escaped from Tarkov anymore."
4676380,4677380," It never really works out."
4677380,4683860," Honestly even as someone who is a relative normie I enjoy Tarkov more than I'm sure I"
4683860,4689940," would enjoy something that's trying to be Tarkov because it's I don't know you're just"
4689940,4690940," kind of along for the ride."
4690940,4696700," I mean part of it is I'm playing with these guys right so I'm just like I'm going to have"
4696700,4700780," a big backpack on and I'm going to put a backpack in it and then I'm going to put a backpack"
4700780,4701780," in that."
4701780,4702780," It's fun."
4702780,4704300," It's fun running around with lying."
4704300,4708740," Russian nesting backpacks."
4708740,4714060," But like this most recent wipe and it's always fun near the beginning of a wipe because no"
4714060,4715820," one has cool gear."
4715820,4721300," Like as a so okay the game wipes every once in a while your character loses all of their"
4721300,4725500," custom stats and you have a stash where you can store all these like different firearms,"
4725500,4728380," body armors, medical supplies, money, whatever."
4728380,4729380," Every once in a while there's a wipe."
4729380,4732460," You lose all that stuff your character fully resets."
4732460,4734060," These are actually really fun."
4734060,4736620," I know a lot of people are going to think like oh you lost all your progress."
4736620,4740740," Yeah but now everyone is on the same playing field and you're playing with these like"
4740740,4743580," janky guns so the recoil stuff is horrible."
4743580,4748220," You're going to like run up to someone and they're going to have like an AK74 that like"
4748220,4751860," doesn't even have a buttstock so they try to fire it's just going to like fly all over"
4751860,4755140," the place and it's just very interesting."
4755140,4758980," But this wipe comes around the beginning of it is really fun having a ton of fun with"
4758980,4765020," it and then they patch some things that made the game better but those patches introduced"
4765020,4769220," randomly invisible players kind of an issue."
4769220,4775060," Not only are they invisible but nothing that they do registers on your side so if they"
4775060,4777220," like throw an item on the ground it's invisible to you."
4777220,4779460," If they make any amount of noise you can't hear it."
4779460,4784580," If you if you know 100% where they are and you shoot them nothing will happen they take"
4784580,4785580," no damage."
4785580,4790180," And they can see you they can interact with you they can kill you they can take all your"
4790180,4791180," stuff."
4791180,4792540," Really really frustrating."
4792540,4799420," At the same time as that's going on Google it AK74."
4799420,4806020," At the same time as that kind of stuff's going on sound is like super messed up completely"
4806020,4807020," messed up."
4807020,4812060," There's no real functioning vertical audio sounds are just coming in completely random"
4812060,4818860," directions like I'll watch someone walk like left to right in front of my screen and hear"
4818860,4825060," them like back there and it sounds like they're upstairs like it just nothing makes any sense"
4825060,4829780," with audio crazy lag all over the place."
4829780,4834700," Everything is just super wacky so you have invisible players which people eventually figure"
4834700,4840100," out how to intentionally do so they can make themselves invisible and it happens to people"
4840100,4847060," at random and you have audio coming from all over the place and cheating is a genuine"
4847060,4852260," major problem in every single multiplayer game that exists."
4852260,4857860," Yeah so you were saying there's like a big Tarkov creator that what like cheated to"
4857860,4862820," find cheaters or something like that like cheated for science that that is not public yet because"
4862820,4869980," that video is not out."
4869980,4873780," And I mean no offense but they're not that big of a Tarkov creator but they're cool they"
4873780,4878020," make cool stuff they're growing they'll get there I believe in you."
4878020,4882100," I mean should we just promote them at this point or sure yeah it's it's goat moth he's"
4882100,4886620," going to be making a video which we kind of just ruined I'm sorry I apologize."
4886620,4892460," We didn't ruin it we hyped it's genuinely fascinating it's wild because he does this"
4892460,4897460," whole thing wow I'm just going to completely ruin it I'm sorry bro."
4897460,4898460," I'm just going to."
4898460,4903380," Okay guys just go subscribe to help to help make up to him."
4903380,4906780," The the oh and goat is the zero go go find him."
4906780,4912940," So he oh man wow who I hope he's okay with this I'm just going to send it."
4912940,4918620," The worst that can happen is he can never talk to you again and tell everyone he knows"
4918620,4922940," about what an utter piece of untrustworthy you are so."
4922940,4923940," Oh for sure."
4923940,4927420," Yeah it's not that bad I've had worse."
4927420,4934580," It's it's deeply fascinating he showed me a bunch of clips where and you have to go watch"
4934580,4938060," it because the feeling that you get from it is actually really interesting and it might"
4938060,4943060," only happen to people who have played Tarkov but I think you should watch it anyways because"
4943060,4949220," like I said cheating in every single game if it has multiplayer is rampant to be completely"
4949220,4951180," honest it's genuinely rampant."
4951180,4953780," Yeah cheats are so sophisticated now."
4953780,4958620," Go just linked is it public."
4958620,4963580," Oh this is from two months ago yeah he made that video two months ago."
4963580,4966340," But yeah cheating in in in games is rampant."
4966340,4970540," You see people get caught that are streamers for cheating."
4970540,4972020," Like consistently."
4972020,4973260," It's happening all the time."
4973260,4979300," We've had people get pulled out of live events professional players on professional teams"
4979300,4983860," getting caught live because they loaded stuff onto their mouse that when their mouse was"
4983860,4988140," plugged in the computer it would inject and then give them whatever advantage."
4988140,4991460," Like there's cheaters at every level and there's tons of them."
4991460,4999300," The problem with Tarkov is there's very little being done to stop them right very little."
4999300,5003940," There's no way to watch a replay of the match after the match is over."
5003940,5009420," And whenever I mention that people are like oh it's a I don't want killcams and talk I'm"
5009420,5010740," not asking for a kill camp."
5010740,5014300," I would do not want there to be additional information that I could give to other people"
5014300,5015940," that are currently playing the game."
5015940,5023020," But once that match is fully complete it would be good if I could watch it back because Tarkov"
5023020,5027500," has horrible servers it has horrible desync it has horrible tick rate all this type of"
5027500,5032020," stuff so it's really hard to tell if someone is a botting you or if there's crazy desync"
5032020,5035620," and you just haven't seen them come around the corner yet or whatever else."
5035620,5038980," So people have known that there's tons of cheaters in Tarkov forever."
5038980,5042860," There's a bunch of ways to be able to know that but people have known for a long time."
5042860,5046020," But the degree of which has been hard to tell."
5046020,5050620," There's a type of cheating that people have known about which people call ESP which is"
5050620,5052700," essentially wall hacks."
5052700,5056420," You can see through walls right."
5056420,5057420," Is it going up?"
5057420,5058420," Oh yeah."
5058420,5059420," There we go."
5059420,5060420," Good."
5060420,5064340," There's a type of cheating in Tarkov called ESP."
5064340,5069020," Not only can you see through walls but next to people's names you can see their name."
5069020,5070260," You can see their KD."
5070260,5072580," You can see their full inventory."
5072580,5075100," You can see the things that they have picked up in the raid so far."
5075100,5078980," You can see where they're facing everything."
5078980,5082600," And that is effectively for B SG right now."
5082600,5084400," Not detectable."
5084400,5085540," How is that even possible?"
5085540,5090620," Because there's no replay system there's no way to see people's perspectives after the"
5090620,5091620," match."
5091620,5092620," There's no kill cam."
5092620,5094980," There's no counter strike style overwatch system."
5094980,5099340," There is nothing if that's the only way that they're cheating."
5099340,5100340," They're not actually aim-boughting."
5100340,5102060," They're not fly hacking."
5102060,5103540," They're not clipping through walls whatever."
5103540,5106820," They just know where you are all the time."
5106820,5109420," Which in Tarkov is everything?"
5109420,5111300," Absolutely obscene level of advantage."
5111300,5112300," Yeah."
5112300,5114060," You're like never going to know."
5114060,5118100," But what he did was he wanted to look into how bad this thing is."
5118100,5119860," I don't want to spoil the whole video."
5119860,5121540," Well they're all going to watch it."
5121540,5123540," But yeah you do need to watch it."
5123540,5128260," What he did was he went out and did the bad."
5128260,5130500," He got an ESP."
5130500,5133820," Because the only way to figure it out is to go do it."
5133820,5136500," And what he would do and I'm not going to tell you how because you got to go watch the"
5136500,5139500," video but go to publishing the video now."
5139500,5142540," That's probably good."
5142540,5145140," But he would, okay I don't want to spoil it too much."
5145140,5146140," Man I don't want to screw him over."
5146140,5147140," Swirl it a little."
5147140,5148140," It's fine."
5148140,5150380," He would test people."
5150380,5155540," So he brought on like a code of rules because he doesn't want to spoil the game."
5155540,5158380," He doesn't want to make the game worse for legitimate players."
5158380,5162740," So he would just follow people around that he thought was cheating."
5162740,5166140," He refused to kill any actual players under any circumstance."
5166140,5169500," So sometimes he'd be following some around and an actual legit player would come up and"
5169500,5170860," kill them and it is what it is."
5170860,5173300," He does have to go into another match and figure it out."
5173300,5178740," But he'd follow these people around and watching how they would react was so interesting."
5178740,5180040," Took him a little while to figure it out."
5180040,5182860," But there's been this thing in Tarkov for a long time."
5182860,5184380," Which people call the Wiggle."
5184380,5189040," It's where you look at someone and you just lean, lean peak left, lean peak right and"
5189040,5190040," do it over and over again."
5190040,5191540," So your character just goes like."
5191540,5192540," Yeah."
5192540,5194980," What does it mean like friendly or like."
5194980,5199420," Back in the day if it was two non cheating players that saw each other it was a way to"
5199420,5201700," indicate yo like I'm cool."
5201700,5203460," We're friendly."
5203460,5207020," They've added VoIP to the game now so you can talk to each other."
5207020,5208820," That's not really necessary anymore."
5208820,5211500," So the gym players don't really wiggle anymore."
5211500,5217860," But if you can see the other person at 600 meters through three buildings in a mountain"
5217860,5223140," because you're wall hacking and they wiggle at you and they're staring right at you."
5223140,5227300," Well, you can wiggle back."
5227300,5228780," So cheaters are using it."
5228780,5235420," We figured out that people were doing this as a sign of like yo I'm also a cheater and"
5235420,5239500," friendly because there's no possible way they could see you."
5239500,5240500," Right."
5240500,5243740," So he would just go harass people."
5243740,5247780," And he would so like and if you were a normal player you'd have no idea that he was there."
5247780,5248780," Right."
5248780,5250740," So he's not actually bothering any normal players."
5250740,5251740," Right."
5251740,5252740," But he was."
5252740,5254780," Because there's a lot of stuff that you just to be clear like it's not like for those of"
5254780,5258380," you who don't play Tarkov which by the way I totally understand."
5258380,5260380," It's pretty intense."
5260380,5261380," It's fair."
5261380,5266380," There's lots of things that you can do in a lobby that are not just PVP."
5266380,5267380," Yeah."
5267380,5271820," So there's like kind of like missions that you can complete and all that kind of stuff."
5271820,5277580," So just because there are there's a wasted slot in the lobby doesn't mean all of a sudden"
5277580,5281540," that this this instance is now completely broken and totally in balance."
5281540,5282540," It's not a problem."
5282540,5286780," He actually probably was not hurting the gameplay experience for the legit players in the lobby"
5286780,5287780," at all."
5287780,5291180," I seriously doubt that he was and like there's legit players that killed him."
5291180,5297900," It's also when he was showing me some of these clips it was it was soul wrenching because"
5297900,5302140," he would follow these guys around for like a long time and you're convinced inside you're"
5302140,5305460," like nope these guys are legit like they haven't looked at them."
5305460,5306500," They haven't wiggled back."
5306500,5310140," They haven't done anything like good good."
5310140,5311140," Yeah."
5311140,5312420," And then he's still following them."
5312420,5313420," He's still following them."
5313420,5315500," He just doesn't give up doesn't give up doesn't give up."
5315500,5320940," And then one of them will look over and through multiple walls just do do do do and the second"
5320940,5325100," you see them start leaning back and forth is just kills you man."
5325100,5331140," And the amount of times that it happens is deeply disturbing."
5331140,5333220," It's like almost every match."
5333220,5337540," It's also whole teams of players who run up against a four stack of players that are"
5337540,5345260," cheating and confirmed because it's easy to confirm right because you can't see each"
5345260,5347460," other and oh right his cheap thing."
5347460,5348460," Yeah."
5348460,5352040," If there is no line of sight it shows a green box around them."
5352040,5354620," If there is line of sight it shows a red box around them."
5354620,5360900," So you know 100% if they can see you or not and he'll even do things like he'll pull his"
5360900,5361900," knife out."
5361900,5362900," Yeah."
5362900,5364980," And then they'll pull their knife out."
5364980,5365980," You can't see each other."
5365980,5368620," You too far away to hear it."
5368620,5372580," He'll even have people that like they can't see him and they'll be like oh why do you"
5372580,5373580," have your knife out."
5373580,5377180," They can't see him bro."
5377180,5379500," Like it's so brutal."
5379500,5382180," It's so terrible."
5382180,5390660," So I like I can't knowing that there's like going to be a cheater in every lobby."
5390660,5391660," Yeah."
5391660,5392900," Why do I play this game?"
5392900,5394300," How's that even fun?"
5394300,5395460," Yeah."
5395460,5397820," And like sure they're not rage hacking."
5397820,5402140," Like people are like oh I get killed by like fly hackers and Tarkov like every match."
5402140,5403340," No I don't believe you."
5403340,5404980," Like it all."
5404980,5409100," And after watching goat doing this deep dive I don't believe you even more because now"
5409100,5411020," I know what they're all doing."
5411020,5412660," Almost all of them are just running the DSPs."
5412660,5416780," And so basically for someone like you that is actually respecting the integrity of the"
5416780,5419940," game which is a very it's a very sim like game."
5419940,5420940," Yeah."
5420940,5426540," There's there's no you know it's there's no halo style radar where if people are around"
5426540,5429980," you and moving you just have a dot that shows you where they are or whatever else."
5429980,5434380," Like you actually rely on visual comfort there's no outlines showing whether people"
5434380,5438860," are friendly or and then there's camouflage too and that's a huge part of the game."
5438860,5444140," Yeah like camouflage actually serves a purpose like it's very sim like and so what you're"
5444140,5450300," essentially realizing is that nobody is actually playing Tarkov."
5450300,5451300," Yeah."
5451300,5456980," People are just playing run around and dunk on people who are trying to actually play Tarkov."
5456980,5460060," And like that's that was one of the weird things about him showing me a bunch of this"
5460060,5466940," footage as well is like he he'd run and hide in some bush and a player would just cruise"
5466940,5472220," right on by and instead of being like yeah you're playing Tarkov you hit effectively"
5472220,5478980," and he ran by I'm now like oh like what a cool dude he's playing the game legit I'm"
5478980,5483540," like proud of this guy who's not killing goat right now because not because he's not killing"
5483540,5488580," him but because he's not cheating so he didn't know that he was there."
5488580,5492060," Apparently the videos the video is live now so you can go check it out."
5492060,5496300," I think he was planning on releasing it tomorrow and all this stuff and I just ruined everything"
5496300,5499220," but whatever it's probably for the better."
5499220,5502340," My bad you can hate me later."
5502340,5508340," But yeah I that that I don't know it's soul crushed me because I always had this like"
5508340,5514140," assumption because every once in a while someone would get you and it's just like man like"
5514140,5518700," really how did they possibly know I was there it didn't feel like an aim bot didn't feel"
5518700,5524620," like anything else but I was just like come on like I I was very stealthy we have multiple"
5524620,5529780," people on this team like maybe Joe and I will be flanking from different angles and they"
5529780,5533140," like perfectly transfer and it's a really big angle."
5533140,5537860," All this like weird stuff it's just like man like I just don't really believe that and"
5537860,5541740," now it's like well like it doesn't even have a kill feed for example."
5541740,5543700," Nope which is good technically."
5543700,5549100," Yeah which is which is which is true to its sim nature you actually have to you actually"
5549100,5554340," have to see the opponent drop and you have to not just see them drop you have to see"
5554340,5559540," them not be picked up and what's your cheating and it tells you they're dead."
5559540,5563620," Yeah and it can be hard to keep an eye on them because you got to maybe maybe they've"
5563620,5567380," got friends you don't know if they have friends because you can't it's not like everyone's"
5567380,5571860," in a party of three or a party of four you can't take that for granted."
5571860,5578700," It's a super cool concept for a game but I'm looking at it now going man you know was"
5578700,5585260," every match that I was ever in compromised probably and he asked me a really interesting"
5585260,5589540," question I thought which was how much cheating is acceptable."
5589540,5594340," Right because you have to understand at some level there's cheaters in every game."
5594340,5597100," There's cheaters in war zone."
5597100,5601060," There was cheaters I don't know about League of Legends but I know back in the day Dota"
5601060,5606260," the Warcraft 3 mod Dota there was cheaters in that because you could remove the fog of"
5606260,5607960," war."
5607960,5612540," If there's a multiplayer game there's going to be at least someone who's finding an unfair"
5612540,5620280," advantage and there is no way that companies are going to be able to defeat this completely"
5620280,5628000," on their own because like how are you supposed to detect someone taking an external video"
5628000,5634120," camera that isn't plugged into the computer that just looks at the screen and performs"
5634120,5637400," actions onto a motorized mouse."
5637400,5639520," You cannot detect that."
5639520,5642200," Nothing's even connected to the computer."
5642200,5646840," So like no extra software running it's not it's not reading memory that it wasn't supposed"
5646840,5648000," to."
5648000,5653000," So like battle I or whatever the heck whatever company has that's supposed to detect cheaters"
5653000,5657960," is never ever going to detect that and people do do that type of stuff."
5657960,5662880," So the solution is to bring back the physical LAN party."
5662880,5664880," But okay so that actually helps a ton."
5664880,5665880," That helps a ton."
5665880,5668000," But like I mentioned there's still people that cheat on mine."
5668000,5672280," And then when you catch them you shame them and they never get to come again."
5672280,5675520," They're banned from every game."
5675520,5677200," Now they can't play anymore."
5677200,5679120," I think the stakes are a lot higher."
5679120,5680120," They definitely are in person."
5680120,5684920," I seriously doubt there's like there's there's no possible way there's as many people cheating"
5684920,5685920," on land."
5685920,5688760," But like it's an interesting question right."
5688760,5693720," And it kind of comes down to the reason why Tarkov is currently ruined for me."
5693720,5694720," Yeah."
5694720,5699640," Is because I am now deeply questioning every single engagement I ever have."
5699640,5700640," Winter lose."
5700640,5702480," Doesn't matter."
5702480,5704960," Yeah and that's that's not that's not fun."
5704960,5705960," No."
5705960,5706960," Oh okay."
5706960,5712320," You know what I find really not enjoyable is like you know that I play badminton I get"
5712320,5713320," pretty competitive."
5713320,5715560," Well I get pretty competitive about anything."
5715560,5718120," And I'm really passionate about badminton I love it."
5718120,5720080," Really enjoy it."
5720080,5725040," I I as someone who's always trying to improve I love playing with higher level players because"
5725040,5727560," they they push me to my limit right."
5727560,5732560," But one of the things that I don't enjoy is playing outside of a competitive setting."
5732560,5734800," I love playing ladder nights."
5734800,5740160," I love playing anything where where the match matters and the more it matters the better."
5740160,5747360," So my favorite format to play is like a point differential format where every point matters"
5747360,5753960," because it's like a team format and the winning team is determined by the total point difference"
5753960,5754960," in your matches."
5754960,5755960," I like that."
5755960,5762960," So I always so the more everyone's fighting for every point the more I enjoy the experience"
5762960,5767680," because it's not I would rather lose narrowly than win by a big margin."
5767680,5768680," Totally."
5768680,5770880," It's kind of my my general philosophy."
5770880,5775640," And I don't enjoy playing when the other person's not trying."
5775640,5780440," You know when because like the integrity of competition matters a lot to me and I think"
5780440,5782720," you're you're the same way."
5782720,5786920," And so while I enjoy playing with players who are much better."
5786920,5791280," I if if I feel like it's a total waste of their time and they're giving it like a 60%"
5791280,5794240," effort I'd rather be both just conserved our energy."
5794240,5796280," Yeah I would I want it."
5796280,5800840," I don't mind losing as long as I can reflect on that situation and figure out how I can"
5800840,5802480," do better moving forward."
5802480,5804320," And maybe that's not an immediate thing."
5804320,5807720," Maybe in a in in like a shooting game it's like okay I need to sit on some aim trainers"
5807720,5811400," because honestly this guy kept his aim around me significantly better than I kept mine on"
5811400,5814240," his and I lost because he's just better at the game."
5814240,5815240," Yeah."
5815240,5818440," It's like okay well I want to practice that someone just mentioned chat valve just banned"
5818440,5820480," 40,000 players from Dota."
5820480,5821960," We do need to talk about that."
5821960,5824520," Yeah so like it's not it's not just shooters either."
5824520,5826600," Super cool they put a honeypot into the game."
5826600,5833760," So there's like a particular memory like a like a chunk of memory that had some kind"
5833760,5840360," of useful data but that they made it so the game would never actually look in it."
5840360,5844400," So only third party applications were checking it."
5844400,5848440," And so they basically just went yeah with a very high degree of certainty."
5848440,5853680," We can tell that every single one of you who checked the values in this I think it was"
5853680,5856320," was it RAM or was it storage I can't remember."
5856320,5859080," But anyone who looked at this is a cheater."
5859080,5860720," Bye bye."
5860720,5861720," See you later."
5861720,5866320," I mean for free to play game like realistically they'll be back with a new account and whatever."
5866320,5868280," But still they lose whatever they had."
5868280,5869280," Whatever they had."
5869280,5871600," At least in convenience thing that was good."
5871600,5874640," Tools of ownage says and we've actually talked about this."
5874640,5884320," You know I think I've gotten less certain seeing the catastrophe that was Stadia and the complete"
5884320,5888160," lack of newsworthiness of anything that's going on with I don't even remember what Amazon's"
5888160,5890160," game streaming service is called anymore."
5890160,5891880," I mean Nvidia's had some big wins lately."
5891880,5894240," They announced that partnership with Microsoft."
5894240,5898800," But tools of ownage talks about well the solution could be game streaming."
5898800,5901200," So that everything is server side."
5901200,5902360," Everything."
5902360,5906280," It wouldn't help with something like a camera pointed at the screen and like the mouse playing"
5906280,5907280," the thing."
5907280,5911800," But other than farming gold or something you know like there's an old reference you know"
5911800,5915280," wow wow wow style right."
5915280,5921200," You know that I think I think that if the cheat gets to the point where they're not"
5921200,5924520," even sitting in front of the computer anymore."
5924520,5927880," I think a lot fewer users will be incentivized to do it."
5927880,5933600," I think the problem that I'm having with this type of stuff is how intense it is you know."
5933600,5936000," It's very overwhelming."
5936000,5940520," But yeah things need to be done about it."
5940520,5942680," Yeah game streaming though."
5942680,5948320," We've talked about how that could be the reason like I talked about like gaming experiences"
5948320,5954760," that are impossible with everyone with everything done client side like like massive environments"
5954760,5959320," or you know massive massively multiplayer games and things like that."
5959320,5964200," But I think getting rid of I'm not getting rid of but dramatically reducing cheating could"
5964200,5965640," be a major incentive."
5965640,5972400," There's there's some interesting stuff too like certain cheats that people use for Tarkov"
5972400,5978880," you can't actually run if you have valorant installed."
5978880,5986360," It's super invasive like ring zero ridiculous anti cheat will find the Tarkov one and freak"
5986360,5988640," out."
5988640,5990120," Wow."
5990120,5993880," So there's another thing where like part of this argument wants me to all wants me to"
5993880,5999760," like I almost want my gaming computer to be like a specific device for game like I almost"
5999760,6004640," want my gaming computer to go more into like the console direction."
6004640,6009800," Where it's like okay well yeah I sat here on a man show and got mad about valorant's"
6009800,6012120," ring zero anti cheat."
6012120,6017000," But at the same time I don't want cheaters in my game pretty okay with like installing"
6017000,6022040," a separate SSD or partition or whatever and just having that for only games and I use"
6022040,6026240," it for nothing other than games and I just let invasive stuff come in and people are"
6026240,6032160," going to bring up I can look at all the I don't know what the exact perfect answer is."
6032160,6044240," But like this ain't it is what I have to say yeah you know what might be it maybe we"
6044240,6047440," should do a couple merge messages Dan do you want to hit us with some merge messages"
6047440,6053440," while we before we do some some more topics or sponsors or whatever the heck it is if"
6053440,6058960," you guys are not familiar with merge messages you check out the cool stuff on elk.tstore.com"
6058960,6062840," we showed up the new when desk pad we've also launched a lot of great stuff recently the"
6062840,6068540," track suit is actually doing really really well you guys seem to be super into that."
6068540,6072440," Or you can just if you just want to send a merge message you can just like pick up a"
6072440,6075160," gift card or something like that you can pick something up later if nothing catches"
6075160,6079640," your fancy but Dan might reply to you if you have like a shout out it can go up here but"
6079640,6083400," he usually selects a few for me and Luke to address on the show and we're going to do"
6083400,6085200," a couple of those now and then we'll do some more later."
6085200,6090080," Sure I'll go in here from Matthew high Linus and Luke longtime fan time at the time merge"
6090080,6095160," messenger mystery shirt for that real life loot box when it comes to hiring do you find"
6095160,6101320," all applicants are fans does that make it difficult to hire not even close honestly the"
6101320,6109320," bigger we've grown the lower percentage yeah that claim to be claim to be viewers especially"
6109320,6116120," as we've grown outside of hiring just video editors and tech writers."
6116120,6120160," I've also had experiences where I think what's happening is there's fans of the channel that"
6120160,6125440," know people that do things that we're hiring for that like link them the job posting because"
6125440,6130880," I've asked people like like how did you find this and they're just like it's a job posting"
6130880,6137240," what do you mean like what's what I don't want to give away what interview I'm talking"
6137240,6141320," about too much but let's say this is not the question I asked yeah like what's your favorite"
6141320,6144600," video I know like if someone complained about your interview process on reddit or something"
6144600,6150160," what's your favorite video or something and they basically just go like I don't know I"
6150160,6155160," don't watch at all yeah and it's like oh wow like I didn't actually expect that but cool"
6155160,6160160," yeah like the wanchow wanchow writer new wanchow writer who hopefully we can introduce she"
6160160,6165680," makes it through her probation was basically I was like have you watched the wanchow and"
6165680,6174840," she's like well I did as preparation for this job fair enough yep yep it's like my"
6174840,6179720," SO super into it all right fair enough I've I've ranted against I think it's like Star Wars"
6179720,6184360," and Halo where they specifically hired people that did not like the franchise because they"
6184360,6188840," like wanted to make it different I think that's stupid but you don't have to hire people"
6188840,6205320," that are pre-existing fans either like emotional damage yeah yeah I think you threaded that"
6205320,6213240," needle well making the reference recognizable without crossing into like questionable uh"
6213240,6220560," any who got them you want another one sure this one's from mason hey Linus and Luke I"
6220560,6225000," know bringing on guests isn't a common theme for the wanchow but is there a person that"
6225000,6230280," if you had the opportunity to bring on to the show you would Bill Watterson my hero that"
6230280,6234360," was a hesitation of his sweet yeah well you know what the reason I was thinking about"
6234360,6243440," it was because he's like one of the few creators ever that I would just buy anything that he"
6243440,6250680," licensed like I have never not enjoyed I would have Calvin and Hobbs anything yeah and he"
6250680,6256960," stubbornly refuses to give it to me because he's like eh you shouldn't merchandise things"
6256960,6261280," for money and I'm like okay that's fair and I respect it but I really want to throw money"
6261280,6269360," at you so this we were at an impasse here create more stuff then and but I mean the last thing"
6269360,6273040," the last thing I would want to do is bother him though so I was so anyway the reason I"
6273040,6276800," was thinking about it was because I was sort of reflecting on my fandom I'm not a fan of"
6276800,6283600," much I am a fan of Bill Watterson and what made me think about it was the conversation"
6283600,6288320," we were having a little while back on wanchow about fan interactions and you know what the"
6288320,6291840," right way or wrong way to approach them and what I realized is that while you and I talked"
6291840,6298000," about what works for us I feel like you would have to tailor it if I ran into someone that"
6298000,6302520," wants to be talked to and wants to be approached I would take a different approach whereas if"
6302520,6308080," I ran into Bill Watterson I would say absolutely nothing I would just go and then I would like"
6308080,6312760," leave right because do you think do you think it's appropriate to do like the head nod at"
6312760,6321520," least I don't know everything I've ever read about him and he doesn't do a lot of interviews"
6321520,6332960," he just he just like seems to value his privacy and I just like okay but if I had it if I could"
6332960,6338240," pick anyone to have on the wanchow all right let's go cool let's go as long as it wouldn't"
6338240,6343520," bother him I would respectfully ask for him to be on the wanchow so assuming assuming like"
6343520,6353280," a it's a consensual I can have anyone on the wanchow you know yeah yeah because that'd be"
6353280,6359240," uncomfortable like I can force anyone at gunpoint to be on the wanchow like no no not that's"
6359240,6362560," not cool I think"
6362560,6379000," I think Todd Howard because I would genuinely be very interested in the conversation more"
6379000,6383880," than I would actually be interested in like I'm gonna fanboy over Todd Howard you know"
6383880,6396840," okay sure I can tell him that the wanchow just works well give us one more and then we'll"
6396840,6401120," move on all right that sounds good to me to roast him no and I understand why people"
6401120,6407960," would say that but just to talk yeah I would I would ask him things that I think people"
6407960,6411480," that would want to roast him would ask but I would also ask him things that I think are"
6411480,6416560," automatic wins it just because horse armor exists and some other things have happened"
6416560,6423040," you have a former hasn't made absolutely legendary products at the same sure so yeah"
6423040,6429320," that's fair okay this one's from Marcus any tips for devices slash tech to having a studio"
6429320,6440640," student department a computer studio student apartment battery banks student studio apartment"
6440640,6452400," yeah a laptop light bulbs TI 83 plus graphing calculator nice I mean or whatever whatever"
6452400,6458120," the probably much newer one it is no it's still that one is it really shut up no it's"
6458120,6464520," not as flow plane chat I'm pretty sure it can't be what is it sorry TI 80 something has"
6464520,6468280," been a T83 plus was what I said there's got to be a newer one there's no way and there's"

7079880,7087960," the entire building is blue i don't know guys i don't know um you know it's a good"
7087960,7096600," wancho when we're debating what color best buy this we do have an update for you guys um"
7096600,7105480," this came up on reddit and it's an update to the apple unlock story that we talked about recently"
7105480,7112680," so apparently a large number of recent gen max have wound up unusable on the second hand market due"
7112680,7120200," to an activation lock apple does it turns out have the ability to distinguish between locked devices"
7120200,7125720," that have been reported missing or stolen and locked devices with a clean record and in some"
7125720,7132360," circumstances apple can and does unlock those devices upon request so this is interesting because"
7132360,7138840," when we were talking about this we were basically saying well hey in the interest of reducing the"
7138840,7149000," incentive to steal a device we actually kind of support um non-bypassable device locks right"
7149000,7157560," except that it is bypassable so this complicates things users of our slash setup app have submitted"
7157560,7161880," dozens of devices through apple's activation lock removal service and a few patterns have"
7161880,7167080," emerged one only devices with a clean status were unlocked what does that mean which makes sense"
7167080,7174360," that it was not reported stolen ah missing makes sense two the vast majority of devices unlocked were"
7174360,7183480," an iphone eight or earlier the iphone eight was discontinued in april of 2020 three all unlocked"
7183480,7190680," devices had been unused for at least a year four when devices were unlocked it appeared to happen"
7190680,7195320," through an automated system when devices were rejected it took significantly longer and went"
7195320,7201160," through a human review so unless there was a fundamental change in the system after april 2020 this would"
7201160,7206520," seem to indicate that apple might have the ability to unlock newer devices or could contact the"
7206520,7210680," original owner of the device and inform them of the unlock request giving them the option to confirm"
7210680,7217480," or deny we have raised issues with that though yeah there's there's potential like privacy issues"
7217480,7223080," i think there's just potential customer experience issues like i just i wouldn't want like okay so"
7223080,7230840," what i haven't used my htc vibe in four years and for whatever reason it was locked somehow"
7230840,7238840," and htc just what like phones means like hey can you deal with this like i mean yeah i guess so"
7238840,7244520," but also sorry why would just sound like a scam yeah why yeah why are you contacting me this is"
7244520,7249720," weird email or phone or whatever i would just assume it was a scam yep yeah i get that"
7251640,7255720," it's chat still seriously talking about best bicolor oh no they're not um"
7255720,7264840," anyway i i don't know i just continue to be disappointed by apple's attitude you know where"
7264840,7269880," they they'll they'll talk about how great they are and environmentally friendly they are and whatever"
7269880,7273800," whatever whatever and then when push comes to shove and they have an opportunity to keep devices out"
7273800,7282280," of a landfill they invariably do not take that path because at the end of the day the only thing"
7282280,7287560," their shareholders care about is how many iPhones they sold this quarter it's just all there is to it"
7287560,7292760," and if they were just if they just owned that and they weren't so like hippie touchy feely about"
7292760,7300120," everything i'd be like okay yeah fair enough so you're soulless and evil and you just wear it on"
7300120,7306920," your face like okay fine fine but just the the duplicitous the duplicity duplicitousness"
7306920,7312760," two-facedness there we go nice i just i find it so hard to deal with"
7312760,7317080," there's there's one that we might actually disagree on which might be interesting hit me"
7317080,7322120," China suppress i disagree China suppresses public health"
7322120,7323000," sotene i chat"
7323000,7329560," regulators in china are apparently telling chinese tech companies to restrict access to"
7329560,7334280," AI powered chatbots made outside of china and to report to the government before launching their"
7334280,7339960," own in-house chatbots no i disagree AI image generators are already censored in china and"
7339960,7346360," bidu's chatbot ernie will refuse to generate images of tianimin square that makes sense"
7346360,7351320," synthetic content like deepfakes are far more restricted than in the west not only to protect"
7351320,7356600," citizens from impersonation but likewise to restrict the potential for parity and mockery of"
7356600,7362360," chinese authorities it is possible that the same factors that make large language models sometimes"
7362360,7368600," respond unpredictably or fabricate information may also make them difficult to effectively censor"
7368600,7376200," unless their data set is also fully censored yeah this could be i've i've just unrelated to"
7376200,7381480," these notes here i was i was reading about this and apparently there's some criticism in china of"
7381480,7386840," the government's efforts to restrict this the data sets of these large language models and"
7386840,7393160," basically going like look uh because of you know what you know you're being thin-skinned about you"
7393160,7400200," know we need the poo generated images or whatever we're gonna fall behind america in this tech war"
7400200,7406200," so here's serious here's the thing though yeah what is your stance on them but so i didn't actually"
7406200,7410040," know the whole thing which is why we're gonna disagree so i'm gonna i'm gonna narrow it down"
7410040,7418680," slightly so just them blocking uh let's say outside of china made yeah that doesn't surprise"
7418680,7423320," me at all what does your stance on that well i mean i think they should do i they just think it's"
7423320,7430920," stupid so what is your i think i knew you said that at some point i don't know if we were like"
7430920,7435160," talking about it off line or what so that's why i thought we would disagree because i don't actually"
7435160,7440760," necessarily think it's that stupid because and my reason for this is look at how we're all reacting"
7440760,7447640," to tiktok existing at all in the west and they're all china's using a different algorithm here to"
7447640,7451480," get the kids to watch dumb things so that they don't have good aspirations when they're getting"
7451480,7455640," older and all this type of stuff that we have talked about on the wancho before i don't know that i"
7455640,7462040," would assign like causality necessarily to those things i think there are there are much"
7463800,7469800," i think i don't think tiktok's helping as far as my understanding goes there is a difference in"
7469800,7474920," the algorithm for in china and out of china where in china it directs them more to like science and"
7474920,7479800," education type topics and like wellness stuff and outside of china it directs them to just who's"
7479800,7485080," making them watch the app more yeah okay which is to be completely honest not different to how"
7485080,7489560," basically anything that's made in the west is made anyways so the criticism there is interesting but"
7489560,7498120," uh but you know but i don't know if i was if i was the chinese government i would be concerned"
7498120,7505480," about like chat gpt i think i would be losing this tech war not only just that but we've had"
7505480,7510920," the conversation here right to be able to make these things work better say you're a software"
7510920,7515000," developer to make it be able to work better you might have to give it some information"
7516440,7521560," so if they allow everyone to use it uh imagine you're a developer for ex-government let's"
7521560,7525320," let's let's remove china from the conversation because there's a lot of"
7525320,7532280," sifranson's there france let's say you're a developer for the paris is not on fire for a change and"
7532280,7537240," you have other concerns there's other stuff to work on it doesn't smell like pee right now"
7541160,7547160," love you love you france beautiful city um but like it's interesting because"
7547160,7554280," it incentivizes you giving it a lot of information because it will work better if you do right like"
7554280,7558200," it is actually a massive security problem we talked about that on one of the first"
7558200,7563960," episodes we talked about chat gpt at all which was like oh yeah it can't read your internal"
7563960,7571160," api docs unless you give it to it yeah then it can and like people have a hundred percent done that"
7571160,7575400," i guarantee it i i know that people have done that"
7575400,7582760," i don't know it's interesting this and the deep fake stuff like yeah we can"
7582760,7588440," i've taken this stance a bunch of times on the show which is where like if you start banning this"
7588440,7592920," stuff other countries are just going to surpass you like it's not like other people aren't going to"
7592920,7598760," make it so at a certain point like what's the point but then we have also brought up the argument"
7598760,7604600," of like yeah they were bad which was nice but when people deep faked us having a conversation on"
7604600,7611640," the wandshow that kind of sucked when people deep faked other people in significantly worse ways"
7611640,7618200," that sucked a lot more like i don't know it's not like there isn't problems with these technologies"
7618840,7625240," and if they make it so that you're only allowed to use ones that are made in country they might be"
7625240,7629560," able to have more control over it there's also the downside that that might restrict their"
7629560,7633880," level of innovation or whatever else which is concerning but i don't know it's"
7633880,7641880," deepfakes AI technology it's it's a really interesting landscape and i can understand why"
7641880,7647080," different governments might react to it in a variety of different ways um is is i guess"
7647640,7653400," all i can say i can run at 3200 megahertz respectfully asks us to delineate between"
7653400,7659400," Parisians and the rest of the french Parisians are specifically known to be the worst in italics"
7659400,7666520," i i don't know this is one of those things where everyone's perception and everyone's"
7666520,7673800," experiences are different you know i hear a lot of the reputation that the french tend to have whether"
7673800,7679800," we're talking kebequah or Parisian or France french the rest of the rest of France"
7679800,7687240," my experience has been very overwhelmingly universally positive yeah in all of those places so i just"
7687240,7694520," don't really i shouldn't say i don't really get it i should say i can respect it because every um"
7694520,7701960," every time i've talked to anyone about it or witnessed anything the issue they have is if you"
7701960,7709080," don't even make an effort to engage with them on their turf in their way so if you just walk up"
7709080,7716680," to someone in Montreal and speak english where realistically like a solid like 75 percent of people"
7716680,7721480," speak fluent english anyway um they're just going to pretend they don't understand you and"
7721480,7726600," um you can basically just f*** off whereas if you walk up and you're just like"
7728280,7737160," jub toilet uh still uh there's gonna be like don't worry about it toilets over there and uh"
7737160,7741320," you know let me know if i can help you with anything when you come out like they're chill right make"
7741320,7747880," even make even the slightest effort and it's like fine and honestly i i can't"
7747880,7756760," ooh are we gonna get spicy today i can't say i don't feel the same way like i don't get running"
7756760,7761880," into people like in my neighborhood where i live who don't speak a single word of english even"
7761880,7766840," though they've lived here for 25 years i have a okay yeah that's a different thing i have a different"
7766840,7772040," take on that because i find it fun i've encountered it and i'm just like i don't like if someone if"
7772040,7775880," someone speaks to you in a language that you don't understand and i've seen this on both sides yeah"
7775880,7781720," when when i don't understand the yeah whatever i've just seen it on both sides but if someone speaks"
7781720,7786040," to you in a language that you don't understand and then gets mad at you for not understanding it"
7786840,7792600," when in that language yeah which is really funny and they just like start yelling at you still in"
7792600,7799080," that language assuming you're gonna understand it now it's like bro no i i have no idea um but yeah"
7799080,7803800," like i i was in i'm just gonna divert because i i think we're going down a not great path so i'm"
7803800,7811560," going elsewhere um i was in i was in paris slash france because it wasn't just paris visiting shadow"
7811560,7817080," fairly recently and we weren't like in shadow's offices the whole time we cruised around we're"
7817080,7820920," checking out different tourist destinations we'd no different cafes doing whatever all that kind of"
7820920,7827240," stuff it was great everyone is really nice i don't know i didn't really get it i did walk past part of"
7827240,7832120," the street that legitimately made me almost hurl oh yeah it was just like i mean new york's the same"
7832120,7840840," any like big city that had a sewer designed like 300 years ago or whatever is gonna be like that yeah"
7840840,7848440," it was like brutal but based on what people had told me earlier in that same day i had"
7848440,7852680," remarked about how i was confused because it didn't smell bad at all and i was confused it was just"
7852680,7857640," very this like one specific spot whenever we'd walk by it it was really bad but yeah people were nice"
7857640,7862360," in paris people were nice in other parts of france that we went to i had no problem with it that might"
7862360,7869240," be because of like how i interacted with those people so they were respectful back i don't know"
7869240,7874120," but yeah i i had no problem there i thought everybody was great"
7874120,7881320," uh bordaga asks is line to say you're an american speak english fellow absolutely not a i'm not an"
7881320,7890120," american and b it's not like the area that i live in is like uh you know a little italy type area or"
7890120,7895480," anything like that it's like literally everything's in english you would have to have completely"
7895480,7900920," inoculated yourself from anything and everything in order to not be exposed to it and to not have to"
7900920,7907400," use it at all like it's kind of it's it's shocking it's like almost admirable if i moved to japan i"
7907400,7913320," would want to learn japanese whether you wanted to or not you just probably should um is sort of"
7914840,7921960," obvious to me but fair enough yeah the should just doesn't apply because for me i would want to"
7921960,7925160," anyways so like it does yeah there'd be almost irrelevant"
7925160,7935240," all right why don't we move on to youtube adding dubbing podcasts and 1080 premium"
7935240,7943400," whoo so before we get into this i just want to shoot in because i like recommend using it i"
7943400,7948120," complained on the show fairly recently i think three or four shows ago about how"
7948120,7953800," despite being being a premium member and despite literally every single video that i would click on"
7953800,7958600," manually switching it to the highest possible resolution yes for a long time being really"
7958600,7962760," diligent about doing every single time it would still automatically putting me at the bottom"
7962760,7968280," resolution forever i complained about that while i was on the show i had the idea of like i should"
7968280,7974920," just make an extension that automatically picks the highest possible resolution and then while i"
7974920,7978360," was sitting there thinking about that being like i shouldn't announce this i should just do it"
7978360,7984280," someone mentioned in chat like hey there's this extension that does this and i was like oh sick"
7984280,7988440," so i went home checked it out got it installed it and been running it for a long time and it's"
7988440,7994600," great so mine just automatically picks is picks absolute maximum now because i was like for a"
7994600,7998760," long time i was just be like oh whatever like 1080p's fine i don't need to like crank everything so"
7998760,8004520," crazy yeah but no they wanted a war now it's max every time no matter what you're gonna get one"
8004520,8013560," anyways the actual topic following last week's leadership change youtube has announced a series"
8013560,8020600," of new features including experimenting with a new 1080 premium sorry not i was going to say"
8020600,8027800," 1080p premium but it's 1080 premium video quality with a higher bitrate despite concerns youtube"
8027800,8033560," does not currently appear to intend to decrease the quality of the current 1080p setting to encourage"
8033560,8039320," paying for the premium version but the new 1080 premium will run at 13 megabits per second instead"
8039320,8045480," of 8 megabits per second with unpaid 1080p i'm sure it's still variable i think that's just like a"
8045480,8050760," general target yeah i don't think this is just an average for the last year a small group of"
8050760,8054760," creators has been testing a new dubbing system soon to roll out more broadly which adds the"
8054760,8058840," option to create multiple dubbing tracks on a single video similar to the current system for"
8058840,8063240," subtitles rather than having to create a different video for each language i believe we were part of"
8063240,8068280," that beta so that includes us we have we have tested it i'm really excited about it i think"
8068840,8075720," i i um i pinged at about it earlier this week and i think i was told that the the first like"
8075720,8081720," integrated into the workflow video is going to be very very soon let me just have a quick"
8081720,8085880," you know what i might have talked to him in person i think it just popped in on him so nope i don't"
8085880,8089800," know i don't have it on my i don't have it on my phone but i think we're going to be ready to roll"
8089800,8096360," out i think we're doing spanish first don't quote me on that but i'm pretty sure because that's what"
8096360,8102680," most of our initial testing was done on it will also be possible to designate tracks and videos"
8102680,8109240," as podcasts in youtube studio as well as adding them to youtube music oh okay Dan's not there"
8109240,8119080," so um i guess i don't really know uh chair uh chair secret labs chair nope i guess he didn't make"
8119080,8123800," it in time uh we're done having this conversation sorry okay again i have a sweater on screen do you"
8123800,8129400," have any idea how our podcast platform uploads work because i don't even know i have recently"
8129400,8137560," found out because we didn't know yeah uh so podcast uploads are handled by sven that's random very"
8137560,8144920," random yeah this is probably going to change yeah that doesn't make any sense yeah i i only just"
8144920,8151320," learned this oh okay we're we're looking into it there might be some reasons stuff like that but"
8151320,8157960," it's also like not automated reasons like that we rolled uh at 106 cited die and it landed on"
8157960,8165160," Sven like i think you have been chosen i think maybe things like spotify you are the one percent"
8165160,8171640," i think maybe things like spotify might get different ads than other platforms that's correct"
8171640,8177800," yeah there are specific ad reads for spotify and then because our ad reads are a variable length"
8177800,8183080," and at variable points in the video i see it can't be automated it's just whenever i feel like doing"
8183080,8186840," it and also for a different amount of time right because you know you wouldn't do it for like okay"
8186840,8193480," for the exact next 90 seconds no matter what we are doing an ad like a section of ads like"
8193480,8200120," it's not structured like that right so you can't really automate it so that means if there's a long"
8200120,8206120," weekend it's not going to be up on podcasting platforms until Tuesday by which point you might"
8206120,8211240," as well just start watching clips because you know who has time to watch like a four hour podcast so"
8211240,8219000," we're like hyper hamstring our own podcast yeah it's kind of hilarious how when show is as far as"
8219000,8226200," i can tell actually an enormous podcast yeah and yet we do everything we can to make try to make it"
8226200,8235480," not to impede its success yeah i don't know man i put these wrinkles here on purpose you guys know"
8235480,8244200," that right oh yeah it's brutal but yeah i i think the irreverence is why they like it"
8244200,8251480," i i want it to be automated in some way it's a feature i just don't know if it can be because of"
8251480,8257160," how we structure the ad spots unless we started doing like we have the timer right so unless we"
8257160,8264440," started doing okay there's the but there's some amount of variance in the recording start in the"
8264440,8268440," recording end so it's always going to be a little odd i don't know if there's some way where we could"
8268440,8273560," automatically splice out if we started being really rigid about the duration of ad spots and"
8273560,8278120," when we did them and stuff like that yeah but we don't want to do that so like it keeps coming back"
8278120,8286120," to if we want to have how to use this the word we to mean liness yeah if we you used it after a"
8286120,8293800," while um if if you if you hey i stop citing things for you is that exactly"
8293800,8307000," happy though uh yeah because now i i can just sign things as myself on behalf of the company"
8307000,8312600," we just we just changed that um what was i gonna say i'm not hearing any of those"
8314600,8318440," but yeah if we want to have custom ads on those platforms it's going to have to be manual to"
8318440,8329160," to to some degree um yeah dark 24 says no liness it is not why we like it some of us tolerate it"
8329160,8333720," because nothing will change no matter what we say you being a troll is not funny"
8333720,8336840," why am i laughing then"
8341080,8346520," oh no casual forgery on the wancho it's been it's been enough time statue limitations whatever"
8346520,8351000," i don't think a week counts hey come on"
8351000,8359320," oh jeez sign my screwdriver yeah at ltx i'll sign everyone's stuff as liness there we go"
8359320,8362760," oh i'm sorry okay yeah i'm doing great"
8367480,8378760," uh um okay uh ltx 2023 byoc update hey speaking of ltx what a great segue way"
8378760,8384600," we know not everyone was able to get a whale land byoc ticket but we were able to shuffle the"
8384600,8393320," layout a bit and we're selling more to 38 more tickets that's it we sold all of them in like the"
8393320,8400120," first day that's gonna do nothing uh i mean that we okay look the thing is we can't take up the whole"
8400120,8405880," floor plan with byoc otherwise it wouldn't be ltx it would just be whale land yeah there needs"
8405880,8411080," to be like yeah fun things to do at the convention yeah and so it's it's a balancing act right so i"
8411080,8416920," get it but anyway i think at some point we're gonna get to a point where the byoc gets like its own"
8416920,8421560," floor yeah or thank you for convention centers multiple buildings yeah so the byoc could just"
8421560,8425880," have its own thing totally and you could be in byoc land which would actually be great for"
8425880,8430600," security anyway yep so you're in byoc land and then you just walk across like this little courtyard"
8430600,8434920," or like external plaza thing and then you're in the other building you're in ltx i mean i could"
8434920,8441080," see us getting there yeah ltx is like kind of awesome super legit well at least the last one was"
8441080,8447560," presumably this next one will be good um yeah assuming it continues to grow at the pace that it"
8447560,8452440," has been over the last two and then what looks like is going to happen for this next one it could"
8452440,8460600," be like a 10 15 20 000 person convention by like 2025 2026 like it's it's pretty exciting it's it's"
8460600,8471720," really cool anyway byoc tickets those 38 will go on sale march 3rd at 5 p.m pacific time so if you"
8471720,8477640," didn't get a byoc ticket and you're into it um go for it uh there's some notes in here for ltx"
8477640,8483000," 2019 we apparently made the mistake of opening up too many more byoc seats at once so we'll be"
8483000,8487480," offering oh there'll be several waves of small batch tickets provided that we sell at each wave"
8487480,8492200," um so if you already have a ticket and want to purchase byoc instead please just do so and then"
8492200,8498120," reach out to support at info at ltxxpo.com so we can refund your original ticket all right cool so"
8498120,8501480," that way you will if you like had any extras on your original ticket or whatever we can get you"
8501480,8507640," sorted it out should we do a few merch messages yeah oh google was accused of destroying evidence"
8507640,8512520," we could talk about that um blah blah blah they were accused of destroying evidence"
8512520,8516760," by the american government"
8520840,8526360," something antitrust at the capes this is a real podcast"
8526360,8536360," i mean at the headline kind of says it all that's okay that's what i was saying about the topics"
8536360,8539720," for this week though they're just like legal stuff which nothing else happened i don't"
8539720,8551800," know origin can make solar panels out of moon dust all they have to do is go to the moon"
8551800,8559720," they hope to market this innovation to nasa cool"
8559720,8566280," maybe they'll win something from nasa that space x doesn't get all right let's do some"
8566280,8573000," merch messages okay sure we uh we've got one here from kira happy friday yeah happy friday"
8573000,8578680," would you say in the programming world it's more important to be an expert in one language or"
8578680,8585080," proficient in many do you have a favorite slash least favorite language oh uh i think it all depends"
8585080,8594760," on what you're doing um like there's there's people that get paid a lot to be extremely knowledgeable"
8594760,8602680," in like a very old antiquated language that no one learns anymore but like airports or yeah or"
8602680,8608520," nuclear silos or or heavy industry or whatever still uses it and they need you to come make some"
8608520,8615480," change to it like once a year and they'll pay you like literally i have heard of contracts where"
8615480,8622440," someone flies in works for like one to five days flies out and gets paid 200 grand"
8622440,8630920," you just have to hope that comes along you need to be the best one you have to hope it comes along"
8630920,8634680," because this isn't going to be like a perpetual thing it's just me a one-time thing i'm not actually"
8634680,8640680," saying this is like necessarily a good career path yeah right to be clear but i know that there"
8640680,8645160," are people that do it because it's like you can just say cobalt that's yeah that's one of them there"
8645160,8651800," are others as well so like that's a situation where being an expert in one language would be good"
8651800,8658200," being proficient in many though has some other aspects of it that might be good like i'm assuming"
8658200,8664040," if you're proficient in many that means that you're actively learning and if you're trying to stay"
8664040,8668680," with the trend of technology the current like language that's going to be the best at doing"
8668680,8674680," whatever is basically constantly changing so if you're only an expert in one you're like no"
8674680,8678120," this is the only one i learned well you're just going to fall behind and you either"
8678120,8683400," luckily become that like one cobalt guy that gets paid 200 grand to do the thing or you don't and"
8683400,8690120," then you just don't have a job so like i don't know um you have favorite least favorite language"
8690120,8699240," not really um i really like the hits french i do actually really hate french such a hater"
8699240,8706040," literally literally here not france but french i i even like hearing people speak french and"
8706040,8711800," stuff is fine but i just when i was learning in school i did not like it um but yeah i like see"
8711800,8720840," i like to see a lot which might come as a surprise but yeah okay uh this one's from anonymous hello"
8720840,8726760," lynison luke was just wondering if either of you have watched jeff gearlings six-month review of"
8726760,8733640," the scruchrever and what your thoughts are on it no but i read the comments i'm serious that's it's"
8733640,8741560," i'm not gonna i'm not gonna dance around it that's what i do um i i am glad that he has had an"
8741560,8747960," overall positive experience with the scruchrever um as a youtuber who sort of understands how"
8747960,8757240," retention curves work and how uh consumption of of media through headlines works as a as a as a"
8757240,8765560," as a king tier consumer of media through headlines um i can't say that i'm stoked that the thumbnail"
8765560,8770600," and title focused on it breaking when actually if you make it like quite deep into the video it"
8770600,8777720," turns out he like broke it on purpose um so it's kind of like a lot of people are only gonna see"
8777720,8785000," that and i understand what your point was it was um you know like a multi-layered sort of um"
8785000,8794840," critique of of of the of the average youtube viewers uh tendency to not watch the whole video"
8794840,8803720," but like it since we all know that and since we're not going to change that um now a lot of people"
8803720,8810120," are just like ltt screwdriver broken it's like okay cool um so that is not the best but um"
8810120,8819720," yeah yeah i'm glad he likes it yeah very enough okay this one's from austin what is your favorite"
8819720,8824760," ltx 19 moment mine was when i got to chat with Linus for a second and he told me the name of"
8824760,8829880," a banger pizza plates d plus pizza yeah d hot i think actually but yes close enough"
8829880,8835800," uh d plus pizza is a completely different thing i think that guy got arrested"
8835800,8846040," i uh you know what i'm talking about no i don't the guy who uh you know on the pizza i didn't know"
8846040,8850520," what oh yeah that's the thing oh yeah that's that you don't want that pizza no you don't"
8851560,8856520," uh when you and i i don't know if we like ran the line or just walked the line but when people"
8856520,8861240," are lining up to get inside you came in crowd yeah that was fun you know that was like go to the"
8861240,8866200," end yeah and then it was like holy yeah that was fun when it was his end that was really cool you"
8866200,8870760," know the line is going to be like twice as long this time right i let's go for a run yeah yeah"
8870760,8879160," okay this one's from jackson hi lynus luke and dan i'm an avid car enthusiast and wanted your"
8879160,8885880," opinion slash thoughts on why auto manufacturers give zero f's on upgrading the electronics in cars"
8885880,8892360," infotainment centers in particular because fuck you that's why a lot cheaper to not because you'll"
8892360,8898840," buy it anyway you piece of shit being on super old processes is like genuinely way cheaper and"
8898840,8907320," actually can have reliability advantages that too um but the main reason the main primary reason"
8908040,8915000," um is because just they don't want to change their technology they just have stuff that works for them"
8915000,8922760," and they just keep doing it i also honestly think most people don't really care that much yeah well"
8922760,8927240," the thing is that it bothers them but they'll buy it anyway yeah and as long as that continues to"
8927240,8934040," happen then i i mean that's one of the things that i was most supportive of tesla about their"
8934040,8940520," better infotainment systems that i think have put a significant amount of pressure on the legacy"
8940520,8947160," automakers to build better infotainment systems at the same time google and apple pushed car play"
8947160,8954920," and android auto forward which has been just enormous for me the last thing that i ever had any"
8954920,8963080," care for was updating the stupid integrated map stupid integrated navigation garbage in my stupid"
8963080,8970120," car take it to a dealer to get a new map are you fucking kidding me like no um i like on principle"
8970120,8975960," i don't even want your new map i don't even care if it's freaking free i don't want it stupid i have"
8975960,8980600," a data i have a computer in my pocket that has a permanent data connection that already takes all"
8980600,8988040," my information anyway so it might as well just go to them instead of you and them um so anyway i'm"
8988040,8997000," a huge huge fan of being able to just set my infotainment system to not use the oem software and just"
8997000,9005720," use my phone and it's great which by the way um i figured out that issue with the navigation so it"
9005720,9010520," just changed the defaults there there is a setting in android auto that i didn't notice the first time"
9010520,9016200," that brings that restores that bottom navigation bar that shows you uh your your previously opened"
9016200,9021560," app and has controls or it has your turn by turn um super glitch and twitch says this is super wrong"
9021560,9025800," the lifecycle of a car is five to seven years started before they're released you are super wrong"
9025800,9031160," that's actually not the reason um and you can kind of look into why the silicon shortage the"
9031160,9037480," great silicon shortage of the corona virus pandemic affected the auto industry more than just about"
9037480,9043400," any other industry and affected the legacy automakers more than tesla who actually uses modern technology"
9043400,9050920," in their cars uh the reason is that they are supply constrained um uh semiconductor manufacturers"
9050920,9056120," want to move on from these ancient processes and they just don't want to redesign things i've heard"
9056120,9064040," horror stories um from like small small design teams that are like yeah um literally the problem"
9064040,9070040," is that the one person who designed that board doesn't work here anymore and nobody else knows"
9070040,9077400," how to like make one so we keep using the same board oh man that that happens kills me you lose"
9077400,9082360," a lot of knowledge when you lose certain members of teams check this out this is how you update"
9082360,9089080," the maps for my car that is the stupidest thing i've ever seen ever you buy a 180 dollar DVD"
9089080,9095800," don't forget about the 32 dollar shipping for a DVD which makes a ton of sense in the age of"
9095800,9103080," broadband internet so annoying actually like i've known about this i have obviously never"
9103080,9107720," updated the maps but i've known about this the whole time i should check you should pirate it"
9107720,9115400," i should check if other people are privateering this software just out of curiosity i mean i already"
9115400,9119240," said you should pirate it i don't think you really need to beat around the bush at this point"
9123480,9128120," there's gotta be there's gotta be like an entire like private tracker or something for that or"
9128120,9135160," so you know people can be shockingly dedicated to shockingly specific causes yeah i should look"
9135160,9139000," into this because apparently that was the last year that they were going to do it for that vehicle"
9139000,9144200," as well so it'd be 2021 that's another fantastically stupid thing yeah i really want something that"
9144200,9148520," will just stop getting updated at some point when you arbitrarily decide there's not enough"
9149320,9155000," this particular vehicle left on the road that that makes that makes such sense it's good it's great"
9155000,9164040," yeah oh it might as well ship on a floppy disk yeah just what do we cooler"
9164040,9171160," okay this one's from thomas hey lienus and luke i've been buying some products both physical and"
9171160,9176280," digital to help my productivity what consumer grade products in the last five to ten years have"
9176280,9184120," aided your productivity the most consumer products man i like having a big monitor i was"
9184120,9190040," gonna say monitors i like my my quadrants i have four ten eighty p screens each of which is 21"
9190040,9195480," inches which is like perfect for me at zero percent scaling so i just have a ton of information on"
9195480,9204200," my screen i love it yeah i just monitors as well this one's from chris i just started a new career"
9204200,9210120," as an av tech for a community school system we've been busy installing new interactive TVs"
9210120,9214840," what kind of tech uh that if you've seen would be helpful for teaching our youth"
9214840,9221000," we are super cool um i mean it's super expensive and cludgy so it's a long way from i think being"
9221000,9228440," legitimately useful for looks like at scale for educational purposes but man 3d printers would"
9228440,9233240," have been super cool i would have loved to learn about a bunch of schools jumped on three printers"
9233240,9238280," right away which i just thought was brilliant because i i didn't think they would necessarily"
9238280,9242840," do it but that is an absolutely wicked skill to have when you're growing up yeah like if your"
9242840,9250600," reaction to something breaking in a in a physical way in your house is oh i can fix that by like"
9250600,9256440," printing a new part and like epoxying it on or whatever that is sick yeah that's super cool that is so cool"
9259080,9263080," okay this one's from charlie highlionis and luke it's probably been answered before but what is the"
9263080,9271400," average age of your viewership love from new zealand this data is always going to be skewed um like i"
9271400,9277640," i've i've seen reports from our audience many many times like hey i couldn't help noticing that you"
9277640,9284600," guys say you're only like one percent female but i'm definitely a chick or whatever and google thinks"
9284600,9290040," i'm a dude or something because i'm into dude stuff but just letting you know you know like i i hear"
9290040,9295640," that a ton i don't know that voice was don't worry about it but like i've i've definitely gotten people"
9295640,9302920," reaching out to me who are like you know just as an fyi you were talking about how you guys skew"
9302920,9311480," heavily male and i'm not going to dispute that but what i will say is that we do exist we do exist and"
9312200,9319800," google often misidentifies um misidentifies people especially ones who are not logged in which is"
9319800,9325160," a significant number of users less today interest and stuff exactly so they'll profile you and just"
9325160,9331320," kind of assume that because you looked at a razor once that you're a guy because it had a blue"
9331320,9336840," handle instead of a pink one or whatever arbitrary bullsh*t right yeah so um there's that and we"
9336840,9343640," also get a lot of people telling us say hey yeah i'm into it but i always watch with the hubby you know"
9343640,9349960," stuff like that right so would be his account yeah so i can i can tell you i can tell you oh i know"
9349960,9357800," i can tell you what google reports to us i'm just saying that i used that at the gender as an example"
9357800,9364440," of a way of as a as a way to illustrate that this data is because like when i was a kid if i was"
9364440,9368520," signing up for a website i would go put in my birthday and then when i hit the year i would just"
9368520,9374360," whip the scroll wheel and click on something random like i still do that if steam pops up"
9374360,9379960," an age restriction thing on my logged in f*cking account with a f*cking credit card"
9379960,9389160," what are you doing bud right i i've had my my account is old enough to vote"
9390360,9396680," right so what what what is the point of this um and i understand what the point is but that"
9396680,9401960," doesn't mean i have to have patience for it and so yeah it's oh really maybe it's a setting or"
9401960,9406120," something like i said it once i know the screen you're talking about yeah through birthday i said"
9406120,9410760," it once and now it it takes that same thing i put in last time and has it by default i haven't"
9410760,9415480," seen that weird you know what maybe it's depending i i use new computers all the time because i'm"
9415480,9418840," always benchmarking it's probably because i've done that on that computer it's probably cached"
9418840,9422200," somewhere yeah yeah so i i run into it all the time i'm like stop wasting my time"
9422200,9428120," and so yeah i just whatever and just select something random yeah get out of my way"
9428120,9437480," anyway so the average okay so hold on oh what median mode average um the bulk of our viewers"
9437480,9447880," 70% of them are 18 to 34 which is exactly what i would expect that honestly sounds probably accurate"
9447880,9454520," yeah am i aging out of our audience it's okay there's these new filters now that make you look"
9454520,9460760," younger oh it'll never matter oh we got this we talked about this quite a while ago talks filter"
9460760,9465000," was it what are we talking about here we talked about quite a while ago but how you were worried"
9465000,9471800," about different features making you look older than people not wanting to listen to tech person"
9471800,9476680," because they look yeah yeah tech boomer yeah i do think there's a best before date on like"
9476680,9482760," there is a hundred percent filters that already exist that happen live that's crazy that make"
9482760,9487560," people genuinely look significantly longer younger and it looks actually like quite good that's wild"
9487560,9492520," it will totally be a thing and it will be like indistinguishable later on i mean if we keep"
9492520,9496440," putting wrinkles in the backdrop then they'll distract from lightness yeah then they won't even"
9496440,9505800," be looking at me exactly yeah um yeah uh then the next big group 17% is 35 to 44 and then it trails"
9505800,9513800," off significantly from there 45 to 54 is 6.4 and then it's uh peanuts below 18 and above 55"
9513800,9520520," um but then again i think there's a lot of younger people that are just clicking 18 i'm certain the"
9520520,9527160," below 18 number is smaller than it is in reality but i bet you that what is it 18 to 35 one is actually"
9527160,9533160," probably pretty accurate yeah i think the 25 to 34 one is probably the most accurate because that"
9533160,9537080," will be the ones that are i like have credit cards entered in the site and stuff like that"
9537080,9544440," um where you can like really make a solid guess as to how how old these people are yeah"
9544440,9551320," okay this one's from Matthew high Linus and Luke what are some red flags you look out for when"
9551320,9557400," interviewing staff on a side note as a developer seeing a float plane developer's blog slash newsletter"
9557400,9566200," would be awesome we just don't have the bandwidth for it yeah maybe eventually i know Conrad has"
9566200,9574920," mentioned uh being interested in writing a a newsletter for uh the LTT store before so it's"
9574920,9580280," not like there will be no development stuff ever but like yeah we we definitely do not have the"
9580280,9584920," bandwidth i mean Luke had the idea of doing one like right at the start and he was like yeah even"
9584920,9591480," just even if no one reads it it would be so cool to look back over it you know five years down the"
9591480,9596440," line and it would be but we've just been i've documented a lot of stuff anyways i have like"
9596440,9603160," really old school screenshots and and videos and so i had the idea of uh of linking every"
9603160,9607640," comment and like every tweet where people told us we'd fail and like printing them out so that"
9607640,9613640," we could wallpaper like our office with it yeah um we we would actually have enough would we have"
9613640,9618440," enough devs like in person here to have like a space where we could have put that probably i"
9618440,9621800," think we could have done it at the lab once we're local there will be at least three of us if we"
9621800,9627560," want more we need to do more float plane merch that's a good point Rod sorry about that well we'll do"
9627560,9633080," it i promise um oh i think our printer is finally back up and running and we're going to be doing"
9633080,9638040," some printed t-shirts again so maybe we could do a blue just like float plane logo one speaking of"
9638040,9642920," working here and stuff yeah there's two there's lots of roles on the site actually especially if you"
9642920,9649240," want to work for labs oh my goodness but there's two new ones uh that are kind of in my realm one of"
9649240,9653560," them is a float plane project manager it is a relatively small team you will also have to do"
9653560,9658840," development um but but as a float plane project manager so we're looking for someone to try to"
9658840,9665160," like work on tasking and help guide the ship um so apply so like like mini luke"
9667000,9676360," kind of but they will also do development and be much more in on things if that makes sense okay"
9676360,9683720," uh and then the other one is for limes media group so what i need to do is delete this stuff and"
9683720,9692840," just go to just jobs nice and it's that's totally elegant infrastructure administrator oh yeah wow"
9692840,9696040," we're finally doing it we are finally doing it it's about time"
9696040,9703400," how much you want to bet that that particular posting gets a lot of applicants i think it's"
9703400,9710200," gonna get a bunch and i i will throw out a warning here uh this is a relatively senior position"
9710200,9716360," and one of the reasons why it's a relatively senior position is because your decisions and"
9716360,9725960," actions are going to have to stand up to criticism against not only me and a j and liness and jake"
9725960,9731720," yeah don't forget about jake jake is jake likes to criticize and other jake yeah oh yeah other jake"
9731720,9736520," and lots of other people don't forget about the 14 million out there and the entire audience yeah"
9736520,9743000," so no pressure and they love picking on infrastructure things that we do at the office so you're going"
9743000,9748360," to be criticized for what you do now even if you get it completely right and it's actually the best"
9748360,9753640," solution for our needs there will be people out there who are experts in their domain but have no"
9753640,9761480," f*cking idea what it is exactly that we do here and we'll suggest all kinds of the number of times"
9761480,9767640," over the years that i've been torn apart for not setting up a sand and i'm just like"
9770440,9779480," no no that's just actually f*cking stupid and has nothing to do with what we do here"
9779480,9786440," chill um it's amazing it's it's actually it's not that i don't know what it is"
9786440,9791080," it's not that i couldn't afford one it's that it would be stupid"
9791080,9798920," and so yeah you'll you'll be dealing with that and it'll it's you're not a team of one oh san storage"
9798920,9803320," area network you're not a team of one you'll be working with uh dan actually you'll be working"
9803320,9807880," with another person that i can't name because they're probo um you'll be working with me you'll be"
9807880,9813720," working with aj you'll have resources and stuff but i want this person to come in to be fairly high"
9813720,9822920," level infrastructure security all that jazz um so yeah apply it's going to be pretty epic uh the"
9822920,9826360," stuff that you do is going to show up on video it should be actually a very fun job if you're into"
9826360,9831880," this type of stuff but just yeah understand that it is a relatively senior position we're not looking"
9831880,9838440," for someone like just out of school something like that um because not only will you be maintaining"
9838440,9844120," what is here but you're gonna have to uh would they work with me they work with jade"
9844120,9851800," i kind of doubt it don't think so yeah i don't think so i mean maybe but yeah i don't think so um"
9853240,9856360," not only you're gonna have to maintain what's already here but you're gonna have to keep it"
9856360,9864680," moving forward and you're gonna have to facilitate um someone like lioness or jake or whoever else"
9864680,9869720," yeah going like oh i want to try this thing for a video and then them coming in like a wrecking ball"
9869720,9874520," and doing whatever they want to do and then you either need to uh pick it up where they left off"
9874520,9881560," and and bring it to full implementation or uh deconstruct and keep going with what we had"
9881560,9886760," yada yada yada so it's it's gonna be an interesting role but yeah apply"
9886760,9893560," cool and what kind of red flags would you look out for while interviewing them there's a first"
9893560,9901080," time chat over here on twitch typical twitch um one big red flag would be this question from dim"
9901080,9906920," shin is there a link to the job posting that's the first test if you can't find it you're not hired"
9908440,9913240," i mean i and you know what maybe that makes me like kind of a merciless apple but i just don't"
9913240,9918040," really care um at a certain point like if you don't yeah if you don't have problem solving skills"
9918040,9922600," like if you don't want it then yeah that's that's that's a huge red flag you can't find that link"
9922600,9928760," you'll never make it here if you're like if you don't want a micromanage we don't have the people"
9928760,9933000," the micromanage yeah if you tell me in an interview that you don't really want the job and i'll be like"
9933000,9937640," i don't really want you here i have what genuinely had that before yeah like why why are you applying"
9937640,9943880," i don't understand like if you're why don't you go well go find something you want to do i don't"
9943880,9948920," want to stand in the way of your happiness like of like you spent it's like it's 40 hours a week"
9948920,9953320," of your life right like if you're not going to enjoy it then get the fuck out of here like why"
9953320,9957640," why what are you doing yeah what are you doing take care of yourself right i'm sure you're not"
9957640,9963160," gonna like it every single day i don't yeah nobody does who does but you know at least a little bit"
9963160,9966120," well there have to be things there has to be things that make up for it right"
9966120,9974360," Jo it's i made it hard required on this one we i know developers are not exactly necessarily known"
9974360,9979960," for their social skills and wanting to communicate a ton yeah but we had a position fairly recently"
9979960,9987400," where the the file drop for resume and cover letter was a required field but you could just upload"
9987400,9993000," one thing so like the vast majority of people just uploaded a resume with no cover letter even"
9993000,9999160," though it says that you have to upload a resume and cover letter and we were just like fine but now"
9999160,10006200," ha ha got them two separate fields both required get owned submit the darn cover letter we actually"
10006200,10013720," do read them come on face 32 says applicant gatekeeping weird it's not weird it's literally an entire job"
10013720,10022280," yeah it's like that's the whole point that's like oh man that's such that's such a terrible take"
10022280,10032920," so so what would your process be if someone doesn't care at all and doesn't want to okay"
10032920,10040200," imagine it let's like i mean it depends on how many applicants you have if you have to fill a"
10040200,10045320," position in one person applies and they're like well you have to fill a position sure i guess that"
10045320,10050040," sounds like an awful place to work yeah i don't think i'd want to be on either side of that interview"
10050040,10058680," table it's like well i might hate you but i guess we're gonna work together well i might hate working"
10058680,10063800," for you but i guess i'm stuck with it thanks for the money yeah that's not great that sounds like"
10063800,10069560," the worst thing ever and like i've had people that uh in interviews have told me that i think we"
10069560,10074120," talked about this earlier in the show even uh that they have like no idea who we are or what we do"
10074120,10080040," really but they like really love this thing that they do and they're excited to be able to do it in"
10080040,10083400," this environment and i tell them different projects that we want to work on they're like yeah that's"
10083400,10088920," on suite like okay great like i don't yeah care if you're excited about working here because of"
10088920,10096040," what like the the the fandom of it that has no benefit or i don't care either way but if you're"
10096040,10100760," excited about doing the things that we do then that's great yeah twitch is like still being twitch uh"
10100760,10106680," robotic sausage over there my probably terrible take is that asking for the link is problem solving"
10106680,10114680," through communication no asking the CEO where the link to apply is is not problem solving"
10114680,10120680," taking something that could take actually less time yeah typing a very similar thing to that"
10120680,10126200," but not the same thing into google and immediately getting results instead of doing that taking two"
10126200,10134040," people's time throwing it out into the ether yeah in like a fast moving live chat it's not better"
10134040,10141240," that's that's that is problem solving but that's a really bad solution and you're the problem"
10141240,10149480," it's like i don't know what else to tell you oh i love you twitch chat i do think that this has"
10149480,10154920," got to be like twitch chat just be in twitch chat which is what is really the reason i'm going to"
10154920,10159480," give them attention for it what if some what is your opinion of people typing their own email"
10160840,10167960," and what is your opinion on and happens if it's very obvious how it happened like it's dot"
10167960,10173480," uh no ocm happens it depends though if they're applying for an accounting position then they're out"
10173480,10178040," got it that makes sense but if you're in the wrong spot you better double check your"
10178040,10183640," whereas if they're applying for a creative position where really what i need is drag"
10183640,10188440," and energy and if they've got a little bit of the dyslexia or they fat finger uh key on their"
10188440,10192680," keyboard once in a while that's not a game breaker everything is context dependent right so"
10192680,10202280," um yeah i i mean if you could if you were just going to create a flow chart of how to weed out"
10202280,10207640," applicants then you might as well just be an AI right you've got to be you've got to be actually"
10207640,10211400," thinking otherwise yeah i get why don't i just replace you with a robot right"
10214840,10218440," one interesting one that i've ran into and i will warn people of this again because i"
10218440,10223960," suspect we're going to get a lot of applicants for this it's super neat and honestly even if"
10223960,10227880," you're if you're applying for the infrastructure position especially if you're running your own"
10227880,10236280," mail server or whatever like that's pretty cool make sure it works yeah had that problem a lot"
10236280,10240120," oh just people like submitting cool like projects they've worked on and you look at it and you're"
10240120,10246360," like this is very broken and it doesn't submit yeah here here's my portfolio website it's been under"
10246360,10251560," construction for six years there's nothing literally interesting on it at all and it barely loads"
10251560,10256840," it's like you probably would have been better off just not showing you that right um or or mail"
10256840,10262120," servers which have like major issues so i literally can't even email them back from gmail"
10263480,10270280," that's also a problem like there's be a little careful with things check your stuff check your"
10270280,10277240," stuff i had somebody who uh they they linked a portfolio website that i think they like didn't"
10277240,10283240," pay their hosting or something so i went to go check it and it was like very clearly offline"
10283240,10287880," so i messaged them about it and they're like oh yeah like i haven't actually checked that and"
10287880,10293160," go to wild it's like maybe do that before you apply bro right okay those types of things so you're"
10293160,10297480," basically looking for basic due diligence yeah because of a lot of the roles that i'm hiring for"
10297480,10304760," that's actually really important right yeah and there's i don't know it's one of those tough things"
10304760,10309960," right like there's personality traits that you can't really expect to train like you can train"
10309960,10314920," a skill but you can't train an attitude in a lot of cases and so if someone just has an attitude of"
10314920,10319640," of perfectionism then that's a very that's a very desirable trait again for you know something like"
10319640,10323880," an accounting position depends yeah um you might not actually want that all time because"
10323880,10330680," perfectionism will often also mean that they take more time to do things yeah so like it depends yeah"
10330680,10337960," i think yeah i think that's uh i think we've talked about a lot of red flags we've given a lot"
10337960,10347880," of hints to the land show audience for how to uh how to avoid our our traps here okay so i won't"
10347880,10357560," email the ceo asking for the application form got it yes success all right next up from Alex"
10357560,10363400," hey Linus and Luke what's something tech related that you vastly disagree on and have just agreed to"
10363400,10370360," disagree raise your laptops i don't think i disagree now"
10370360,10377800," well we did for a long time we had a strong disagreements about those for a long time all the way back to"
10377800,10383320," pre-linus media group actually really yeah i mean i don't i thought i thought their switch"
10383320,10388120," blade thing was stupid i thought it was cool but like cool in a like i'd like to see where this"
10388120,10392600," goes in the future kind of way not like if this is a good laptop kind of way eventually you want"
10392600,10397240," i think we were still not listening to group yet maybe we were just still working NCX once a week"
10397240,10401400," i don't know you know what i didn't have i had never really like owned or raised or anything and i"
10401400,10407240," didn't have first-hand experience with their qa yeah i did at that point sure so that's fair yeah we"
10407240,10414840," disagreed um but that's i i don't know if that's really like a techno is it like technology disagreement"
10414840,10418840," it just says tech related tech related what's something tech related i mean i made fun of you for"
10418840,10423400," like standing firefox for the longest time especially when it was going through its"
10423400,10430760," very long period of being a complete and absolute piece of shit yeah um i actually think firefox is"
10430760,10438120," in a good state right now but the problem with it is site compatibility like when i i told you that"
10438120,10441400," i tried to switch to it i think we've talked about this on the show so i'll try to keep it short"
10441400,10445960," but i i did try to switch to it and it was actually very good i really enjoyed using it and then i"
10445960,10451560," had to use the patty website yeah the scuba diving website yeah that's a terrible website"
10451560,10458200," i don't like it doesn't work on firefox at all so it's just like okay i guess i have to go back to"
10458200,10462680," chrome other than that i actually really enjoyed the firefox experience i thought it was really good"
10462680,10471000," i have to pee it hit me like a ton of bricks i'll be right back okay see i drank this whole thing"
10471000,10475560," i don't think most tech stuff we disagree on though um let me see if i can find some"
10475560,10481160," loop specific one yeah yeah fact oriented yeah yeah i don't know if that came through he was saying"
10481160,10489560," we're both pretty fact oriented um which is true like we both had um aTHON64 AMD processors in our"
10489560,10494360," systems forever ago and then ran intel for a long time when intel was running winning and it"
10494360,10500120," wasn't because we like liked AMD and then liked intel it was because AMD stuff was awesome and"
10500120,10504840," then intel stuff was awesome and now we're both back on AMD stuff because now AMD stuff's awesome"
10504840,10509640," like it's more about just like what's good at the time you know i've got a specific one here for you"
10509640,10514520," Luke sure this is for Matthew hey Luke what do you think about the recent layoffs at the big tech"
10514520,10519480," companies do you think they will continue or will they start to rehire and what about flowplane"
10519480,10527480," well flowplane's hiring right now i announced a position i think 10 minutes ago so that's a thing"
10527480,10534840," uh flowplane will also probably but it's going to somewhat depend on how things go in a variety"
10534840,10541480," of ways uh but we will probably be hiring again before the year is over but i don't know when"
10541480,10547080," it's very likely that's going to be like Q3 or even maybe Q4 like it might be near the end of the"
10547080,10554440," year but it's very likely we'll be hiring again um and we're finishing up a hiring way for the lab's"
10554440,10560520," web development team right now i know the lab's local team is hiring i believe a junior software"
10560520,10570600," developer um like yeah we're we're hiring and we we didn't have like giant layoffs um so we are"
10570600,10579000," not in that category um will it continue i i don't know i'm not really in the like silicon valley world"
10579000,10585400," so i have no idea i suspect companies that haven't done it yet i would be concerned um but if your"
10585400,10590840," company has done one of those massive layoffs i think they're probably done now unless they're"
10590840,10592360," twitter lol um"
10592360,10602760," and yeah i've already seen some of those companies start hiring again i think a lot of them once a"
10602760,10608200," couple other companies started doing it tried to use like oh it's just the industry as escape"
10608200,10615400," goat to get rid of sections of the company to like slim down in cost-effective ways not because"
10615400,10620760," they had to but just purely because of like they thought the stock would go up all right so"
10620760,10621400," spell my hand"
10621400,10629320," fresh can you identify that smell we have new soap and i was i was kind of identify like"

10675880,10679880," or too expensive with bad quality it's a good question you might be able to pack it in there but"
10679880,10684360," i wouldn't say the back would be particularly comfortable i yeah i don't know that i would"
10684360,10687640," yeah i don't know that i would recommend it check the dimensions they're on the site"
10688920,10694200," this is an anonymous one high line is luke and dan youtube has been recommending the old videos"

10706680,10712120," like no you're not um so he has a screwdriver now says he likes it but that's that's about it"
10712120,10718440," yeah oh yeah this one's from garen hey guys i've been a fan for about eight years now"
10718760,10723800," did a project for school graphic design recently involving advertising for companies"
10723800,10730280," do y'all have a brand standard manual or something similar if we do i've never seen it but i wouldn't"
10730280,10737720," be surprised if um so like a pitch deck no i've no idea no it's like it's like a whole like"
10737720,10744600," guideline thing for like how many pixels far away you need to be from the border of something and like"
10744600,10748040," if it's on a dark background what does it look like and if it's on a light background what does it look"
10748040,10751560," like i'm pretty sure sarah has something like that but i don't think i've ever seen it"
10751560,10757880," canadian rail branding is like the best one ever it's really detailed about all sorts of"
10757880,10763880," unreal yeah um this one's from tugs question as a small business owner with success"
10763880,10768120," what do you feel your biggest we are f'd moment was and how did you overcome it"
10768120,10776760," oh uh that's a pretty easy one uh in the very early days when we had no money we uh yolo went"
10776760,10783560," outside and filmed a video in the rain and i kind of figured well there aren't that many gaps in the"
10783560,10794440," chassis of the sony fs 7 oh i thought it was gonna be the windy day no the drive to the ferry oh well"
10794440,10799720," that was just you could have died but other than that it would have been fine no let's not talk about"
10799720,10805800," that um let's talk let's talk about instead uh going out and filming in the rain because they"
10805800,10809640," didn't really seem like there were that many gaps in the chassis uh we finished the shoot"
10809640,10817080," got back to the house i went to turn on the camera and black screen so i disassembled it to the"
10817080,10821800," greatest degree that i could that night after everyone else had gone home or to their room upstairs"
10821800,10828840," it was very early days and i didn't have a space heater other than a radiant style one and i"
10828840,10835240," didn't really want to point a radiant style heater at my black camera um not knowing you know what"
10835240,10842600," was sensitive or not sensitive to heat so the only blower style air cooler i could conceive of was"
10842600,10851880," a test bench with uh g force uh 4080 on it or 480 yeah with a 480 on it and so i think i put a couple"
10851880,10857240," of them on there fired up fermarck or like some other stress test in the sli and basically just put"
10857240,10863240," the camera in the exhaust so that whatever was in there might hopefully evaporate if i remember"
10863240,10869720," correctly at this point in time i had a 480 in my system and we ripped it out of my system to help"
10869720,10876520," this heating project which was just very funny yeah so that was terrifying because at that point"
10876520,10886760," if we had money not had a camera i didn't really have a way to get another like camera easily we were"
10886760,10891320," it was it was tight yeah it was tight even the method of getting that one was fun and exciting"
10891320,10897080," yeah yeah like yeah like import it from the states or something like that and then like"
10897080,10905480," in a specific way yeah we shipped it to NCIX who uh i forget why but it was like hard to get it in"
10905480,10915560," Canada for some reason it was stupid yeah okay let's get you another one here no we're not talking"
10915560,10925240," about the ferry thing this one's from uh yeah no no it's not happening this one's from Conner tell"
10925240,10930360," us about the ferry thing no okay uh hi guys i like the screwdriver now getting in the water bottle"
10930360,10935640," my question is what is the most notable thing in everyone's opinion to spring out of the LMG"
10935640,10942040," media universe minus the lambo oh it's got to be the it's like sad lineus or lineus selfie like"
10942040,10949960," memes i did not see that what about the wait i don't know if this is fair i was going to say"
10949960,10955000," your original screwdriver is orange and that literally set the color for the company forever"
10955000,10961560," that's pretty notable yeah i don't know that it sprung out of us though like yeah that's why i"
10961560,10970680," kind of yeah the the ltt cinematic universe i think um yeah i i think it would be uh there's"
10970680,10976440," the christmas album so i couldn't even finish that it's a real thing by the way"
10976440,10984840," you can uh DM the ceo and ask where to buy it oh god uh or you could just go that might be faster"
10984840,10994120," yeah it's awful i still and i i could filter them out but i don't want to because i every"
10994120,10999240," single time it happens i just laugh so hard i still get emailed every single time one of themselves"
10999240,11006440," and i just every time i get like a ping on my phone i'm like oh what's going on and i see what"
11006440,11010520," email it went to and i'm like oh interesting like i wonder what this is and i drag it down it's like"
11010520,11017000," you have sold one one copy of the LG christmas album and just every time it chews me up it's great"
11020280,11027480," because you know that someone just purchased raw trash like it's so bad it's digital garbage"
11027480,11035720," it's an actual waste of zeros and ones it's so bad it is so so terrible like point 13 21 says oh god"
11035720,11043080," i forgot about that album it needs whatever the opposite of the grammy is i had it on my phone for"
11043080,11047400," a while because i don't even remember why it literally wasn't to listen to you but it was on a"
11047400,11053800," local file on my phone so google play music back in the day would just randomly start playing it"
11053800,11059400," if i had it on like play random songs because it would be like it's in your local files you must"
11059400,11064760," like this music so i'd be like driving along and i'd be listening to whatever and then out of nowhere i"
11064760,11073400," just hear the lightest singing style at night like the album of phloebling exclusive he told me to upload"
11073400,11077800," it for christmas and then i don't remember why i didn't but there was some reason but i'm planning"
11077800,11083080," on doing it next christmas look if you if you guys are watching us like laughing about this and"
11083080,11090120," thinking oh man this must be like hilarious it's worth buying time just understand that it's bad"
11090120,11098200," and don't do it yeah it's not worth it it's like five dollars and it's not worth it it's it's like"
11098200,11105480," it's a level of cringe which is not actually very entertaining yeah it's really not i mean"
11105480,11112920," look i'll take your money but don't give it to me it's three dollars buy something on the story"
11112920,11115960," you would three dollars and it is not worth it"
11115960,11127400," it's even it's even missing songs and there's nothing we can do about it it's missing songs yeah"
11127400,11132760," like songs that were in the teaser or that we advertised lost tracks i ever do that i remember"
11132760,11137320," trying to hunt it down i don't remember all the details but apparently yeah there's just songs"
11137320,11145880," that are just gone so few so people you don't even get the full out because i figured once we figured"
11145880,11150440," out that it was missing songs because it's just like a zip if i remember correctly it's not like"
11150440,11160280," get it in a reasonable way so when someone told me it was missing songs i asked about it"
11160280,11164280," internally and they're like oh yeah we just don't have those so then i had to update it being like"
11164280,11172840," uh yeah these don't exist whatever one thousand one oh yeah my phone's going oh no why you guys are"
11172840,11181960," stupid stop i want to remaster it it's not worth it can i please spend time on that absolutely not"
11181960,11188440," much more important things to do forbidden for biben five people have bought it please oh the"
11188440,11194360," other fun part is the email comes in and how our envision powerboard the software that we use for"
11194360,11199960," the forum how it works is you could get commissions off of things that you sell it has to be uploaded"
11199960,11205480," by an account so it's uploaded by my account but the commission is just set to zero percent right"
11205480,11210760," so every single time it emails me it's all excited it says you have earned zero point zero zero dollars"
11210760,11219640," seven people bought it start genuinely is not worth it you're gonna download it because you're"
11219640,11224680," like this is a fantastic meme you're gonna play one song and just be like oh you're not gonna make"
11224680,11231400," it through a full song i promise it's really bad i wonder if i can find the lyrics i think i did it"

11237160,11241960," might they might stroll in slowly over time oh no that's the wrong this is the wrong account"

11246040,11249720," supposed to be saying oh boy every time i refresh it goes up we should have increased the price"

11505800,11513720," stretch to be like um video games are fun uh in terms of tech though you know if anything i think"
11513720,11518360," it can be an impediment sometimes because i'm so quick to kind of jump in and try and fix something"
11518360,11524520," because i just want it fixed that you know i think that there's room for me to make my kids do more"

11659560,11667080," also from nick hi for melbourne australia my gym had just installed adverts on the mirrors what are"

11681800,11685880," i would switch jim's because you're supposed to be paying attention to your you probably wouldn't"
11685880,11693000," care because you wouldn't see it anyways um to just be honest but but like people are supposed to"
11693000,11698760," yes people use the mirrors for vanity no problem don't care about that if you do it or not"
11698760,11702840," but the mirrors are supposed to be there in a functional way so you can watch your form"
11702840,11709000," if you're being distracted by an ad that is intentionally trying to grab your attention away"
11709000,11712840," that's actually like not a good thing that's fair and i don't want the idea of like i'm pretty"
11712840,11717960," deep into a workout my brain is wandering a little bit and i start staring at some ad and then i"
11717960,11723400," hurt myself like no i want to be able to focus screw off i would switch jim's i would just"
11723400,11729720," out of principle i'm gone by the way um the the did you watch the the worst tech ads video by any"
11729720,11735400," chance yes actually i'd seen a lot of those before some things never change"
11735400,11746840," yep yeah when you when a van was like why did you know it was msi and you were trying to explain"
11746840,11754600," like i just i just do i felt that i was like yeah it's just it's just msi it's just what they do"

11781800,11790280," ecosystem is bad yeah but once you are invested in an ecosystem i mean basically you just have to kind"
11790280,11798440," of go how much money do you have because like if you're yeah wait why are you buying an s95b if"
11798440,11803320," you can't afford a bravia you should just wait a generation when qd oleds will get way cheaper"
11803320,11810120," like that's that's the actual solution the answer is always wait and buy it second hand or"
11810120,11818280," wait for the new one that is better because that will cover literally every outcome so maybe if"
11818280,11823720," it's like uh stereo 3d or something like that and there doesn't continue to be new development"
11823720,11830040," there will definitely be a period before it becomes a collector's item like a crt like a crt"
11830040,11835160," period you could call it where getting it will be extremely cheap so you can either wait for"
11835160,11843000," a new one that's better and cheaper it's technology right like it's predictable or you can wait and"
11843000,11850120," get it second hand from someone who is who who doesn't manage their money as well as you do"
11850120,11854440," because you're you're gonna be smart like that yeah yeah i was reacting to something in chat"
11854440,11859560," don't worry all right cool moving on next one okay this one's from hector line us what is the"
11859560,11864680," story behind the katana you have on your fireplace i've seen it in multiple videos and wanted to"
11864680,11871320," know if there's a story behind it also any update on the ltt screwdriver holster the story behind"
11871320,11878360," the katana is i was at the richman night market with evan and i had always wanted a sword because"
11878360,11885480," i am a man child we've and no not that i know i have a sword too yeah like see this one i was the"
11885480,11891560," kind of kid who would be like 13 like hanging out in house of knives being like sores i mean"
11891560,11895160," they weren't even like real i'm pretty sure they were decorative but i didn't care i just like"
11895160,11901240," swords you know like they're big and and long and manly they're swords right like what's to not like"
11901240,11906520," about it so i just like swords and i was finally sort of an adult and i was like i don't have to ask"
11906520,11911880," my mom for the sword this time because she's not here so i'm gonna ask my girlfriend for a sword"
11911880,11917640," she didn't actually buy it for me i just wanted approval and she was desperately in love for some"
11917640,11923240," reason so she said yeah you can have a sword and now i have it and now it's on our mantle um as a"
11923240,11932760," reminder that she um has more love for me than sense i uh swords are just cool and stuff and when"
11932760,11938120," my brother got married he chose me as his best man and i don't know how true this is but i believe"
11938120,11943080," there's some history behind best man actually being originally best swordsman or best fighter"
11943080,11950360," so i brought a sword to his wedding nice with his like yeah i asked him obviously i'm not that"
11950360,11957800," guy uh the photos that they have of mostly actually his wife standing there in her like full"
11958920,11967080," bridal gown thing holding this gigantic sword it actually looks so sick nice like they're super"
11967080,11974360," cool i don't know yeah but i still have it it's dope and it is andoril which is why i always"
11974360,11982200," remember the name of his company nice round round pile and float plane my love of swords versus my"
11982200,11990840," fear of knives okay sorry no no uh next up from artem i am currently studying for mechanical"
11990840,11995400," engineering and i have noticed that you have been hiring more people with an engineering background"
11995400,12001640," what have they studied and done to make you hire them they studied engineering and then we needed"
12001640,12005560," engineers i mean we've never really had a need for engineering in the past because we're a media"
12005560,12012680," production company a lot of people don't understand what kind of company we are um like remember i"
12012680,12018040," talked about how we got um that uh that offered a purchase a little while back right on my initial"
12018040,12023000," last week uh we've gotten more than one that was like a serious one where they actually had some"
12023000,12026520," idea what the heck it was they were buying but we've had so many people reach out thinking that"
12026520,12032920," we're a tech company and like you know trying to offer you know possibilities for partnership or"
12032920,12041880," like uh like i had man i had this i had this one uh one guy approached me because his company um"
12041880,12048040," is like a trucking company and soon there's going to be these mandates around uh like trackers and"
12048040,12051880," the trucks or something like that and they were like yeah maybe we could co-develop one i'm like"
12051880,12060200," we are a media company yeah um we're not a tech company but that's changing right with float plane"
12060200,12065880," and labs and creator warehouse so we have a lot more need for engineers than we used to because"
12065880,12070120," before it was like no we need video editors and writers and creatives now we need more of the"
12070120,12078920," hard sciences right so um that's why yeah wait a second Linus media group is a media company"
12079480,12084360," on go right is it a Linus company too is it a group"
12084360,12094600," next up sort of Michael uh hey Linus and Luke i'm a systems administrator for his school district"
12094600,12099240," how do you feel about one-on-one technology in education do you feel the benefits outweigh the"
12099240,12106600," cost and e-waste i think it's one to one one two one i'm not actually sure everyone's be honest"
12106600,12111880," oh like one device to one yes student yeah um i guess one to one is a different yeah"
12111880,12120760," i mean given that these people are going to have one device dedicated to them for their like"
12120760,12125800," entire life as far as i can tell i don't think this paradigm is going away anytime soon it seems"
12125800,12134040," sensible enough the issue is cost um i mean well what we need is we need a way to make sure that"
12134040,12139080," these devices can be used over an extremely long period of time i think framework has the right"
12139080,12144760," idea but their Chromebooks are so expensive that they'd be uneconomical for a deployment like this"
12144760,12152360," um i think that as as costs continue to come down for something serviceable we're not going to get"
12152360,12159320," around the the e-waste problem um other than you know the first r reducing or sorry we're using"
12159320,12164280," whatever it is no we're not reducing anything whatever using it for as long as possible where"
12164280,12168760," we can do that but it's still going to be an increasing consumption so it is not the first"
12168760,12176200," ours what i was trying to say um yeah i just want to see longer lifespans i guess but i don't"
12176200,12184600," inherently think that sharing a computer you know with my with my classmates was"
12184600,12188440," particularly beneficial in typing class like we just kind of should have both had one i don't know"
12188840,12195800," yeah my only concern is school districts that would definitely in no way be able to afford it"
12195800,12202520," which is a thing um so we need more money in education yeah see i i i don't think we have the same"
12202520,12210280," um issues around district to district funding as i as i know are very common down south uh i"
12210280,12216600," know my like in the boonies high school was like broke is all heck have i told you the story of"
12217560,12226040," one of the reasons why one of the best things like ever i i'll just say his name because he's"
12226040,12231640," awesome and i believe he's a principal now uh but my computer teacher mr. tattle did a lot of things"
12231640,12237160," for me that were like very foundational in my opinion right but one of the things that he did"
12237160,12242920," maybe he doesn't want to tell me the story but i'm gonna go for it here we go um he convinced"
12242920,12248840," a bunch of trucks that were going around to other school districts picking up old computers old"
12248840,12253880," computers old monitors old computer parts whatever and taking them to recycling facility to come by"
12253880,12259960," our school um but just like leave it there for a little bit and then they could take our stuff and"
12259960,12265560," take off and what actually happened was when the guy wasn't with the truck all the computer students"
12265560,12271800," ran out and like basically grabbed everything they could off the truck and ran it into one"
12271800,12277560," specific classroom and then left it there so we had like all this e-way stuff none of the computers"
12277560,12285480," worked right and then it was a project in the class to go through all these computers verify"
12285480,12292920," what components worked and build computers and we built an entire classroom that's cool it was"
12292920,12298520," such an incredibly cool and fun project for a bunch of kids that like yeah a decent amount of kids in"
12298520,12302600," my school had computers at home but not all of them well for sure yeah not by then and you're not"
12302600,12308120," going to be allowed to just rip apart random computers in class because we only have so many"
12308120,12313080," yeah now we had a bunch of spare parts to keep the rest of the labs up and going we got a new lab"
12313080,12320120," and you had all these kids that had some form of ownership over these pcs because they made that"
12320120,12324840," yeah which we would have never had the ability to do that oh a bunch of people were saying do"
12324840,12329960," that's awesome mr. Toronto was an absolutely insanely fantastic computers teacher he also like he went"
12329960,12336280," to BCIT for a summer course he did a course over the summer at BCIT and then took what he learned"
12336280,12341480," there and taught a brand new course that didn't exist in our school system before called 3D game"
12341480,12347800," programming which was just an amazing course and it was like diluted from what was taught at BCIT"
12347800,12352600," whatever it wasn't the same thing but like he did just passionate teachers are a game changer"
12352600,12360360," oh it was it was fantastic I mean I I write for a living now and it's only because of my AP English"
12360360,12368520," teacher yeah I I had a very unsurprisingly due to dyslexia and all these other issues I had a very"
12368520,12372680," poor score in English for a really long time and then I had one teacher that was just super"
12372680,12377080," inspiring and like believed in me and understood the problems that I was having but was like"
12377080,12381080," you're still creative you can drive this forward and just my average English just shot up and then"
12381080,12385240," I took AP English with another teacher it wasn't as good because he didn't share the same things"
12385240,12389320," but I was confident at that point so I was able to carry it through and still passed and did okay"
12389320,12393880," there I don't know that was that was amazing I don't even know how I got on that subject but"
12393880,12400360," that was one of the like coolest things I've ever taken apart of watching everyone else in the class"
12400360,12407320," just be so excited every time a part would pass yeah yeah like and we had to we didn't know"
12407320,12411960," if a single component worked right so at the very beginning everyone's trying to find like the first"
12411960,12417880," functional motherboard right and then we use that to like pass all the RAM and like try to"
12417880,12422040," figure all these different things out and like that's a cool puzzle and then when you would go into"
12422040,12426200," that lab to do whatever class it might not even be a computer class but you might need to work on"
12426200,12430680," computers for whatever reason you'd know like what the good computers were nice so you'd like"
12430680,12436200," try to snipe the good one and stuff like it it was just I don't know it was so cool so so so cool"
12436200,12442280," I might have some parts of that story wrong my whatever age I was when that happened brain"
12442280,12446600," might have remembered it in certain slightly more fantastical ways like maybe it was totally"
12446600,12454360," above board how he got those computers I don't know but but it was just incredibly fun and I know"
12454360,12457960," that the project of like trying to pass good all these components and building all these custom"
12457960,12463480," computers is a thing that a lot of other schools didn't have that opportunity and I know we did it"
12463480,12469240," because not only did we need another lab at the school and we couldn't afford it but it was one"
12469240,12474360," of the coolest ways that he could introduce like hardware to a computer's class possible"
12474360,12481880," it was absolutely fantastic huge amount of respect for him okay next steps from Russell oh man I"
12481880,12488680," never know what to say I wonder if Linus would write an audio sorry autobiography one day or"
12488680,12491560," has it all been left out there on the interwebs"
12491560,12497800," I went as far as I think I have a title for it"
12497800,12505000," something the story so far"
12507880,12512040," here I'll read my four or like I'm not a forward because someone else writes that but like whatever"
12512040,12516200," the like part of the beginning is if I was a total sellout I'd have structured this as an"
12516200,12519640," inspirational story about how anyone can do it if they try hard enough and a collection of tips"
12519640,12523560," to help you achieve what I have but then if I wasn't interested in making money I wouldn't"
12523560,12527640," bother writing a book at all it's a pretty transparent cash grab from my perspective that's"
12527640,12532600," been the fine line I've walked throughout my career I'm not one that's a pretty good way to say"
12532600,12536840," I'm not the kind of person who either genuinely or otherwise hides behind the I do this out of"
12536840,12541000," passion line from day zero when I was asked by my boss to start making youtube videos I've been paid"
12541000,12546040," now to be clear I was chosen for the assignment because of my genuine passion for technology and I"
12546040,12549640," was only good at it because of that passion but I never would have started making youtube videos"
12549640,12554600," without a bonus on my paycheck so back to the book for a minute why did I write this for the money"
12554600,12559560," but if I didn't care about creating it it wouldn't be any good so did I sell out I guess you'll have"
12559560,12567640," to read it to find out seems good yeah I don't know I guess it'd be pretty good but that's about"
12567640,12572200," as far as I've gotten well no I've written more than that but I just that's all you get for now"
12572200,12576120," you gotta buy the DLCs to get more come to the free Christmas album"
12576120,12587400," okay next office this is an anonymous one hello fellow Vancouverites how does Linus survive"
12587400,12594360," without coffee also is there any other plans for an LTT store not calm I'll answer the not"
12594360,12601080," common yes we're gonna do it the goal is this year whoo okay this one well oh you guys were asked a"
12601080,12607080," question I was just 70 albums I've sold now by the way um surviving without coffee is easier if"
12607080,12610840," you never drink coffee yeah don't drink it in the first place you're less dependent on it"
12610840,12616440," it's literally a drug you get literally addicted to it if you don't drink it after"
12616440,12620600," while you have withdrawals like it's totally a thing I don't know I don't drink it either there are"
12620600,12626040," definitely days where it's been a little hard and I've been like I could but then I'm always like okay"
12626040,12631320," that just makes future days harder so I'll just tough it out I'm not saying that's a good idea for"
12631320,12638600," everyone but it works for me seems to work for Linus okay this one's from Aaron spending B-day"
12638600,12644360," cash on some stuff I've been eyeballing can hardly wait with labs ramping up has there been any tech"
12644360,12652200," or tech related categories that you have decided not to test security yeah we thought about it we"
12652200,12658520," actually we had a applicant that would have been like really good for it yeah but decided not to go"
12658520,12663560," down that path and I honestly think that's probably the right way to go like you mean like a software"
12663560,12668280," like antivirus software or something like that because that's one that I definitely said no forget"
12668280,12679000," it mostly software but it was it was a variety right um anything else yeah I'm trying to think like"
12679000,12683800," there's stuff that I probably can't imagine we'd get that into like I don't see us you know getting"
12683800,12689640," really into the weeds on you know like generic android set top boxes or something like that you"
12689640,12695000," know like like little like like content piracy boxes yeah and it's just not really our jam I don't"
12695000,12699080," think we'd be focused most don't think that it can be measured objectively yes yeah"
12699080,12706360," our goal isn't really to inject opinion so if it can't be measured objectively it's going to be a"
12706360,12712440," little tough next up is from Aidan hey Linus loved the content I was wondering if there was going to"
12712440,12717720," be an LTT pocket knife multi-tool sometime in the near future we are not working on that"
12718760,12725240," um I'm not saying we're not working on that like I'm sure maybe at some point but at this time"
12725240,12732360," we're not working on that yes I'm wearing this wacket it's the sweater jacket it's not half"
12732360,12743800," sweater half jacket half cool half cool yeah that's that's it is a half I mean it's LTT merch so"
12743880,12748920," it's going to impress a certain kind of person yeah yeah some people might not think it's as cool"
12748920,12755560," where now yeah exactly I promise you my personal Linus Tech Tips guarantee it will get you laid"
12755560,12761480," please note Linus Tech Tips guarantees are for entertainment purposes only"
12761480,12768440," can we get that on this shirt no oh uh next up term AJ during your ram tour you weren't"
12768440,12774120," allowed to show some conversations about the 24 gigabyte sticks you got crucial has since"
12774120,12782600," announced 24/48 gigabytes of ram is that what you weren't allowed to show yes uh yeah it's strange"
12782600,12789800," she's boring uh this next one's from Jacqueline I think buying the LMG Christmas album should"
12789800,12795880," be available as one of our low cost merch messages nobody needs it I don't think that was an equation"
12795880,12802280," that the LMG Christmas album matches the quality of other things that are on the LTT store yep and"
12802280,12808200," I think it will remain it is a waste of power consumption to transfer those bits and bytes also"
12808200,12813480," that yeah spending 90 hours on it it's not worth the contribution to the strawberry I can't stop"
12813480,12821400," reference hi five I suspect almost no one you may not work on it I forbid it all right so we just"
12821400,12828360," got some potentials left in the incoming okay out of 10 how ignored was I just now pretty aggressive"
12828360,12836040," yeah okay you cannot work on it on company time no at all it is my copyrighted material and you"
12836040,12843000," may not work on it I don't I'm gonna cover it it's gonna say I don't think you can actually say"
12843000,12849560," that Linus can I please have a sync license what's a sync license I just know it is um so you can"
12849560,12853800," actually like comes from like the recording industry yeah he's gonna he's gonna like"
12853800,12860760," dodge around me here no no this guy because you own the copyrighted material yeah so under"
12860760,12869400," copyright law yeah I can release audio covers but I can't release videos of me playing your song"
12869400,12877160," what seriously that's called a synchronization license and your your song covers can't be put"
12877160,12884120," to video it's very weird very very strange wow yeah that's wild that's really odd yep why does it"
12884120,12890200," exist music videos I don't know I'm guessing it's strange I'm literally guessing all right what"
12890200,12896440," else we got we're into potentials this one's from an alan Dimash what watched is Linus where"
12896440,12902520," the gold one with the blue strap can we expect float plane exclusives on ltx all right some"
12902520,12907640," wittings watch that I forgot to put on today but I wear just because it's a watch I don't use any"
12907640,12913000," of the smart features at all I kind of give up um and yes you can expect that yeah I would suspect"
12913000,12920680," so yeah okay next up's from aden hi long time fan you used sorry there is a comment here"
12920680,12928600," hi long time fan he used to talk about wanting ltt store to take off as its own thing have you"
12928600,12935080," ever wanted to compare a week month of not shouting it out every video versus when you do nope can't"
12935080,12944280," say i have that's not that's not uh this is from shame hey Linus I remember your story of maintaining"
12944280,12949880," your sp 650 instead of buying a zero have you been able to get much enjoyment out of your bike"
12949880,12957320," since deciding to keep it bike nerd and fan of the show I don't find much time to ride um but I am"
12957320,12964680," being extremely stupid right now my bike is currently in a shop getting all of the paintable"
12964680,12971960," parts ripped off of it so that I can paint it like pink with iridescent green accent kind of"
12971960,12976840," depending on how the light yeah the lambo is now a motorcycle is sort of what I'm going for"
12976840,12983880," um I'm very very excited it's going to be it's going to make absolutely I could buy my bike"
12983880,12989000," probably a couple of times over for what I'm going to be spending making my bike look cool which is"
12989000,12996200," probably the most frivolous thing I have ever spent money on okay this one's from Steve I know"
12996200,13001560," Linus was playing the Witcher 3 at one point on when did he finish the game thoughts on it played"
13001560,13007000," the Witcher 1 or 2 thoughts remaking Witcher 1 open world with Unreal Engine 5 instead of the"
13007000,13013560," red engine a lot of questions uh I never made it past the tutorial because I got distracted"
13013560,13019880," and all my gaming time has been fentation for a while but I'm looking for something new I kind"
13019880,13023880," of want to play stray that's like that's like the one that caught my eye that I'm like I want to"
13023880,13029880," do that because apparently it's a pretty short experience and I want something contained uh yeah"
13029880,13036440," you're not going to get lost in the stray meta uh next up is from anonymous Linus and Luke what"
13036440,13046520," are your favorite flowers um zalman cnps 7000-cu that's beautiful is that like a sea bucola is"
13046520,13053400," called a flower or something yeah this is this is some old school stuff oh my god I remember"
13053400,13061000," wanting one of those so badly yeah without hesitation I don't you had that memorize don't you"
13063240,13067000," okay I don't know I'm not super I like plants I'm not so into flowers though"
13067000,13071880," I like having some greenery around your home though makes it feel less"
13071880,13079160," dead next up some eric hey Linus have you had any more time with the GPD win four after the"
13079160,13087640," short circuit no okay I'm still uh rocking my i-n-e-o next I just have all my stuff on it it's"
13087640,13091800," like not because it's necessarily the best one anymore tan you're just sending them into curate it"
13091800,13095880," I know because we've already done curated it's easier than rejecting them and then archiving them"
13095880,13100120," okay um so the rest are like incoming do you guys just want to breeze through these they're"
13100120,13106040," kind of like the third level of curation at this point okay I had a lot of really good questions this"
13106040,13112920," this uh stream um I don't know sure you know what I"
13112920,13119160," I don't know what you did with that one I blooped that one really what's blooping it I just sent"
13119160,13125160," it to screen oh okay I don't know verified by verified.com that's funny is it what should that site do"
13125160,13132840," nothing I don't and thanks yeah um this was this was a big career okay I got a negative"
13132840,13138440," for you to do it on kbhd you see like the first 30 seconds of that video was just us on the wancho"
13138440,13143720," what what video yeah Marquez did a video on chat gpt oh and it just like he doesn't even show his"
13143720,13149400," face for like the first half a minute it's just you and me on wancho oh I must have confused a good"
13149400,13154840," number of people I know I have it sorry is this an ad like skip I should check that out or some"
13154840,13162520," kbhd I constantly get frustrated like deeply frustrated that people have these like revelations"
13162520,13167880," about chat gpt or bing chat or whatever that are things that we talked about on like the first"
13167880,13173800," episode that we talked about it at all and I'm just like and I'll see it like blow up like it'll"
13173800,13178840," it'll be like oh the top thing on twitter is people figured out that you can like circumvent"
13178840,13184760," security things by convincing it that it's something else yeah the first show I did filter bypass mode"
13184760,13191240," it's just a different version of that get over it like come on I feel like people that watch the"
13191240,13197080," wancho honestly probably feel the same way yeah because they're in yeah they're here yeah exactly"
13197080,13202280," um on the inner circle I'd something to say but I don't know what it was oh right what to do with"
13202280,13206440," that domain I actually thought of something I shouldn't have skipped it verified by verified"
13206440,13212760," yeah you should figure out you should be able to type in like say a company or a person or whatever"
13212760,13216360," a handle that would be the same handle across a bunch of different platforms and figure out how"
13216360,13225640," much money they spend every month on verifications all right thank you for that it's pretty good"
13225640,13235000," what did you make tech for a living right though it wouldn't be that hard to do that's that's one"
13235000,13239560," of the reasons why I like it okay I guess we'll just start burning through these Anthony says podcast"
13239560,13245800," listener here we are real um yeah do you think the way we build PCs will ever change I mean Anthony"
13245800,13252680," other Anthony or Anthony not you did a really good video talking about how it's probably a matter of"
13252680,13257320," time before things get more integrated and I think he's probably right in the longer term"
13257320,13260920," uh okay then I'll just archive"
13260920,13269160," if you weren't in your position as tech gurus with access to limitless hardware what do you think"
13269160,13274760," your hardware upgrade habits would look like frequency performance tier I was always a"
13275400,13283080," a step down from top kind of person so I'd be likely to end up with like your non-ultra version"
13283080,13294280," of a phone with your like you know 30 70 30 70 TI sort of tier of of GPU um core i7 maybe probably"
13294280,13300520," core i5 you know whatever can be kind of overclocked or unlocked or hacksword in some way to get"
13300520,13307240," pretty much the performance of the top one but at half the price and in terms of frequency uh for"
13307240,13313000," like PC gaming I was I was in every gen kind of character for a long time sometimes multiple"
13313000,13317560," times a gen just to try different stuff because I was constantly buying used and flipping so it"
13317560,13322200," wasn't really like costing me anything in terms of phones I think I'd be a pretty infrequent"
13322200,13328200," upgrade or I mean I went straight from the note nine to the full uh Z fold three whatever the"
13328200,13333080," stupid branding they have for this is and other than that my screen is cracking down the middle I"
13333080,13337080," haven't really had any reason or temptation to upgrade this because honestly upgrading your"
13337080,13341320," phone's a hassle yeah it's really sucks I know it's not as bad as it used to be where you had to"
13341320,13345160," like go into the store to get them to transfer your contacts or whatever but it's logging into"
13345160,13352440," 10 million things still sucks pain in the butt I uh I haven't paid for the components of a"
13352440,13361800," mainline computer for myself since I was a teenager right I'm in my 30s I don't know whenever I'm like"
13361800,13368760," this sucks I'm lagging in this game I just like bug-line is it's pretty sick do you fair you get"
13368760,13378360," views out of it symbiosis reaction yeah yeah um and phones I'm a I'm an infrequent upgrade or"
13378360,13383720," honestly mostly not because I don't like want better battery life or whatever I don't want to go"
13383720,13389080," through upgrading to a new phone it's an annoying process yeah and I don't use my phone has to annoy"
13389080,13396200," you enough yeah to overcome the annoyance and over 90% of what I use my phone for is like work"
13396200,13403560," notifications or work messages which is going to be like discord team slack those are going to run"
13403560,13408840," just fine over rules says try saying hey you know you know assistant set up my new phone and it"
13408840,13413480," automates quite a bit yeah but it doesn't automate all the stupid entering of passwords and"
13413480,13422280," 2fa and going in and adjusting my stupid swift key long press delay and blah blah blah blah blah"
13422280,13428680," get it like clearing out all the nonsense unnecessary notifications that my app send me so that I"
13428680,13434920," only get the ones that actually matter yet whiskers app I only care if the litter tray is full that's"
13434920,13442840," literally the only thing you can tell me that matters uh stuff like that right oh right I'm"
13442840,13449240," supposed to just keep doing this yeah just a reason right okay um it's really hard to read my mic"
13449240,13453720," it's like right here and it doesn't matter um I'm sad too do either of you have a game that's coming"
13453720,13462840," up this year that you're looking forward to yes oh looking forward to um anticipating yes I thought"
13462840,13465800," I wasn't gonna play Breath of the Wild 2 because I thought I was just kind of done I never played"
13465800,13470760," the DLC but then I fired it up for some reason oh yeah I was playing around with switch emulation"
13470760,13477560," and I like fired it up and I was like I'm gonna play it um what is he even called it's been so long"
13483000,13488680," anonymous currently looking for job in the US and stuff sorry starfield suffering through"
13488680,13493880," their atrocious visa policy have you guys hired immigrants before should they apply how did it go"
13493880,13500120," it sucks it's so brutal it's the worst people talk about how Canada brings in like a massive amount"
13500120,13508040," of immigration all the time it's like yes but yeah also no yeah it's also very challenging there are"
13508040,13514200," a lot of roadblocks in place there's tons you can't just be like hey sup neighbor come on come on"
13514200,13519240," over you live in you know Britain and he's a Commonwealth country or whatever I guess that's"
13519240,13525160," chill now I'm there are contractors that we work with that are outside of country right now that"
13525160,13531400," would like to be inside of country right now and that's not changing for them unfortunately I found"
13531400,13546760," out on Wednesday evening that we have not paid Gary yet Gary's the head of the lab"
13546760,13557400," it has been for like six months at least that's brutal so the reason like at all you"
13558120,13563960," gotta be something you could do a contract thing no no you can't so there's there's a whole thing"
13563960,13570120," you gotta lunch with him or something and ask him about it but don't worry I already like I"
13570120,13575240," checked with him I was like hey has Yvonne offered to lend you money in case you need it or whatever"
13575240,13581000," just you know yeah like under the table like like whatever and he's like oh no no everything's"
13581000,13589720," fine okay Gary anyway yeah anyway um he's almost got it sorted out I think he said he he told me"
13589720,13595800," then that he should have his um his like personal number like let's say like the social security"
13595800,13601080," number equivalent um in like three business days or something like that so it should be sorted out"
13601080,13608440," but the problem it was a getting him here b getting to be able to stay here c getting him the"
13608440,13615960," documentation that he needs to work um and it's just yeah it's absolutely ridiculous so yeah we have"
13615960,13621400," not actually issued him a paycheck yet and I was like Gary that's fucking ridiculous he"
13621400,13626120," need to solve this and he's like yeah I'm working on him like okay well you don't seem to have the"
13626120,13632600," appropriate amount of fire under your butt so like I must insist you must be paid for this"
13633640,13639800," I know it's complicated not I was just bugging him um and no he's not just waiting it's been"
13639800,13645720," many different hurdles to jump over it's it's been no I mean like waiting on no yeah yeah he is now"
13645720,13651880," yeah but it's been shockingly stupid yeah yeah and you'd think like you know America and Canada"
13651880,13658520," lots of treaties lots of general international cooperation but a lot less than you'd think yeah"
13658520,13663720," it's not as easy as you'd think yeah well Gary be making a fat paycheck well I suspect that first"
13663720,13672680," one's yeah I bet that first one's pretty good pretty hefty a thick thick boy yeah um what's a"
13672680,13677000," piece of tech you imagined as a small child that you still wish was a thing today that I imagined"
13677000,13681400," as a small child I mean I imagine I wanted a lightsaber more than anything and the hacksmiths"
13681400,13688840," come about as close as anyone can I think yeah I wanted a really really fantastic version of a"
13688840,13696440," NIA a neural impulse actuator um I've always been fascinated by different input devices I think"
13696440,13701560," that's one of the reasons why I find VR so interesting honestly is the input ramifications more than"
13701560,13707800," almost anything else um I find things like Tobii eye trackers and everything else just very very"
13707800,13715080," interesting and I have always wanted the ability without just like completely screwing myself over"
13715080,13723400," which is questionable uh to be able to have just like brain to device inputs I've always thought"
13723400,13729800," that'd be really cool and I watched there was a video that I watched recently of this lady using a"
13729800,13736760," much more modern version to do something I don't remember what and it was like okay this technology"
13736760,13744600," has clearly moved forward um because her demonstration was fantastic but it's still not like it's not"
13744600,13750600," quite there you know Dylan asks Luke do you think you'd be a mid or senior in the market if you were"
13750600,13755320," looking for a job I'm in an interesting position where I'm a senior at my job but if I were to apply"
13755320,13760200," in the market I'd probably be more like a mid depends what company you're applying at depends on"
13760200,13770120," the size of the company that you're applying at um I don't know how specific to go but it depends"
13770120,13778680," on that yeah okay Joey asks there's this in Seattle uh a store called REPC that recycles old PCs to"
13778680,13783640," fight e-waste for how much of it there is why do those kinds of stores seem to be disappearing"
13783640,13788120," rather than thriving I think it's just because it's cheaper to ship it overseas than it is to"
13788120,13794280," process it here with North American labor which is a whole complicated can of worms that I don't"
13794280,13800280," think we're gonna open up right now yeah do you have a current do you have a current recommendation"
13800280,13806440," for VPNs and or password managers I believe um what are we migrating to for password manager keeper"
13806440,13811960," yeah and I'm still using PIA even though I don't know if it's like a good one and I don't think"
13811960,13818040," there's any you shouldn't trust any VPN because they have access to everything same with keep"
13818040,13824360," er yeah we're not telling you to trust keeper yeah it's the it's the ship we're getting on but we'll"
13824360,13829880," see how it goes yeah I mean we got on last pass and look how that went yep so like it might suck"
13829880,13834920," we are the the thing moving forward is we're gonna try to be more ready if something like that"
13834920,13839480," happens again for us to be able to pivot to something else but not using a password manager is not an"
13839480,13847560," option for us yeah or for you yeah like use them yeah just be ready to move off quickly do some"
13847560,13855960," research into the company make sure that if they get super mega hacked um that hopefully your vault"
13855960,13861160," is gonna be decently okay even though your vault might leak and then if your vault leaks you know"
13861160,13867000," move off change all your passwords move on it should be okay wow bitwarden there's a bunch of"
13867000,13871880," reasons I don't want to like dive into this I'm not surprised a bunch of you just said bitwarden"
13872680,13877320," and I'm not surprised at a bunch of you said bitwarden because open source one of our main"
13877320,13881800," reasons is in our in our testing at least and this isn't something that we like prepared for a"
13881800,13887320," video or anything so relax but in our testing at least we found the autofill worked better for a"
13887320,13898120," lot of the things that we use it for didn't think it was a good idea to tell what we used"
13898120,13903960," neither did Jake that's yeah that's honorable enough but I guarantee you within two weeks last"
13903960,13908920," is gonna leak it anyways yeah so it just doesn't matter security through obscurity"
13908920,13916600," it's not super effective um Daniel says if internet access seems to be the thing that always"
13916600,13921640," trips up AI systems and leads to them being unstable what do you think could be done to"
13921640,13930280," mitigate the problem I mean not much I think that's just if you train something on human data it's"
13930280,13937240," gonna end up kind of human warts and all um glad your daughter loves the plushie greetings from"

13954920,13959800," retool some of the float plane infrastructure because we had one viewer stationed in Antarctica"
13959800,13964840," whoa I forgot about that that was a yeah like a research outpost or something stupid like that"
13964840,13969240," so we had to figure out how to make sure their stupid video wouldn't stupid buffer and it's"
13969240,13975240," stupid Antarctica which wasn't my problem fortunately but Luke and AJ had a wonderful time with it"
13975240,13981080," I don't even remember exactly what we did or whatever but I remember addressing that a long time ago yeah"

14027800,14035160," for me it feels bad it like it feels like the old SSD upgrades when you like double your refresh"
14035160,14041640," rate it just like feels significantly better okay I'm playing to this one um thanks for making"
14041640,14046520," baby shopping or baby shower shopping easy what are some things you had as a kid that kids today"

14063400,14068840," super super sour and then it got like discontinued and it popped up on reddit a little while ago"
14068840,14073000," people were talking about it and like I think the rumors that it caused cancer or something like"
14073000,14077960," there was some kind of health concern I ate a ton of them um that's unfortunate yeah that's one"
14077960,14083800," of my favorite candies I would love if my kids could try that candy and not get cancer um yeah"
14083800,14089800," I don't know um I remember my dad complaining a lot about how like candy quality had gone down"
14089800,14093320," since he was a kid and I always just thought now your taste just changed dad but like"
14093320,14100200," wagon wheels when I was really young were awesome and now they taste like actual dog food I believe"
14100200,14104520," that's actually been like documented right I don't know maybe because whatever company made wagon"
14104520,14108600," wheels like got bought out by some other company if that makes sense quality and a lot of these"
14108600,14113720," different candy brands have just found that they can save costs in a variety of ways or whatever"
14113720,14118360," that's been happening to a lot of different like honey nut Cheerios man as much as mkbhd might"
14118360,14122600," have like built his brand on his love for honey nut Cheerios the honey nut Cheerios that he eats"
14122600,14128200," tastes like dog sh*t compared to what I had when I was a kid but before they they changed the formula"
14128200,14133000," and they went like all whole grain everything honey nut Cheerios were so good I would literally sit"
14133000,14137080," on the couch like watch the hockey game and like eat an entire box of them I used to have them like"
14137080,14140840," every morning when I was growing up yeah like that that young that young boy did not get to"
14140840,14144440," experience honey nut Cheerios this is totally off topic not part of the question but something"
14144440,14149000," that I always find fascinating is the differences between Canadian and American versions of like"
14149000,14155960," the same thing like maybe and popcorn corn pops yeah is the weirdest that's smarties are like"
14155960,14162760," terrible like I've actually grown to like them oh yeah I know it's an acquired taste for sure the"
14162760,14169000," Canadian ones were the Canadian ones peaked in probably about 2002 yeah back when they used to"
14169000,14173960," like cut your mouth and I know that's gonna sound cut your mouth came later okay okay yeah so"
14173960,14179560," they were perfect and then they cut your mouth yeah and then they went sogtastic or yeah it might"
14179560,14183480," have been the other way and then they just like never improved I haven't actually had them in a"
14183480,14187320," long time either better now but or maybe they went back to cutting your mouth I don't know but"
14187320,14191240," they were like cut your mouth even during cut your mouth but pre cut your mouth especially"
14191240,14197000," those oh my goodness so good peak and then they're so good man when they were like like hard as"
14197000,14202360," glass it was an experience it still tastes good though yeah it saw the flavor just the texture was"
14202360,14206280," but then the the flavor went away because I guess they just weren't putting enough glaze on the"
14206280,14211240," mafter and they just got soggy instantly absolute garbage check out bad and there's smarties"
14211240,14219480," which are rockets look basically like M&M's yeah and then down in the States are what we call"
14219480,14226760," powder candies yeah just weird yeah yeah good stuff yeah Tynan just brought up the exact same thing"
14226760,14232840," oh yeah Joe Scallen over in float plane chat toys in cereal boxes video games in cereal boxes"
14232840,14238360," that was sick oh demo discs yeah that'll that'll be my thing demo discs"
14238360,14245160," demo discs are sweet you know they get like a magazine that have the demo disc in it"
14249320,14256440," this might be a weird one but I liked the flow of information more back then the internet was"
14256440,14265880," around but it wasn't as vastly used um so you weren't just like completely bombarded with all"
14265880,14271880," this terrible stuff all the time you know I don't know but you could access the internet and it had"
14271880,14278680," a lot of information on it whatever I'm just replying to some in text here blowing through a few more of"
14278680,14285960," these good morning when I have recently gone from 20,000 US dollars to 40,000 take home in under a year"
14285960,14290840," wow how have you dealt with your meteoric rise in going from scraping behind the early days to"
14290840,14298520," being a real company I got to tell you that I took a long long long time to really change my habits"
14298520,14305800," at all and I know actually got the same is true for this guy um and the reason for me was that"
14305800,14314680," even though my income went way up the amount of reinvestment and debt that I was carrying went way"
14314680,14322600," upper for a very very long time and so I mean like I finally I finally like bought the dumb car"
14322600,14328200," learned to love the bomb or whatever yeah uh realistically I probably could have"
14328840,14337560," I probably could have had a not Chevy Volt like a while ago but for me there were there were sort"
14337560,14345080," of internal goals that I wanted to hit um and just like feeling like I can actually relax about"
14345080,14354680," it a little bit I think is um what happened yeah and he just doesn't spend money yep I do have"
14354680,14362360," some costs like my body is like broken in a few ways so I go to physio pretty often um and stuff"
14362360,14369080," like that but I don't get a lot of personal satisfaction from just buying things um I actually"
14369080,14377080," feel it very negatively pretty often I don't mind buying like a quality thing that I know I'm"
14377080,14384280," going to use a lot yep but then there's a lot of research that goes into that um and a lot of"
14384280,14390680," the time you'll find that like most of it's just junk and then I'm not very interested like"
14390680,14396360," yeah I'm not gonna go just specifics actually but uh and then I'm not very inspired to buy it"
14396360,14401480," anyways but then when I do find something that I like research a bunch and then I feel really"
14401480,14406360," confident buying it and then I buy it and it shows up and it is really good like yeah I'm pretty"
14406360,14411880," into that I like doing that and it's nice that I can do that um but like just going to the store"
14411880,14415960," and just like buying some random junk that I think is neat doesn't uh doesn't fulfill me it"
14415960,14420440," doesn't make me happy any thoughts on whether or not MMOs that are shutting down should be forced"
14420440,14428920," to give up the server code yes yep uh has line has seen his AI counterparts on a thin AI heroes"
14428920,14435080," twitch channel it's eerily accurate so I have heard about this I didn't know that they made them for"
14435880,14442600," you but I've seen some made for other people and they are significantly higher quality than the"
14442600,14456600," ones that we reviewed on the WAN show uh sure uh yeah one sec"
14464040,14470520," keep doing what I'm best at actually I'm planning a ten let's go back to hey mkbhd you know an AI"

14482600,14486760," questions while I now know I'm technically a machine but I'm just going to keep doing what I'm"
14486760,14490760," best at this one doesn't sound good actually I'm planning a 10-bit HDR for the stealth like"
14490760,14496920," boner hiding operation and of course like boner perfect it's gonna be enough for the job"

14553240,14560200," received any complaints yet so that's always a solid indicator we might find out they've got some"
14560200,14565400," dirty secrets down the road haven't seen any indication of that yet though hoping for the best"
14565400,14569400," but that's where we're at right now so full disclosure the sponsor but that's the reason I'm"
14569400,14574200," bringing them up is that we've been pushing them for a while and we haven't seen any issues"

14586600,14590760," ironing anything onto the backpack it's made of recycled water bottles which means"
14590760,14599400," or melt it'll melt so um please don't do that yeah and that's it we will see you again next week"
