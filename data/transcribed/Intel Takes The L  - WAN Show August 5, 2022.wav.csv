0,3480," How y'all doing everybody?"
3480,5800," Happy Friday and welcome to the WAN Show."
5800,8800," We've got a fantastic show lined up for you guys today."
8800,10360," See, I told you guys I was gonna do it."
10360,11200," - Yep."
11200,14280," - Lots of great topics, more trouble for Intel Arc"
14280,18040," as board partners reportedly bail on the project."
18040,20800," That's a little awkward."
20800,23800," In other news, (laughs)"
23800,27080," Amazon apparently wants to buy iRobot"
27080,31720," for 1.7 billion, not the movie."
31720,34560," We're talking about like robot vacuum cleaners."
34560,35640," - They needed some inspiration."
35640,36480," - Yeah, I mean-- - I didn't want"
36480,37320," to buy the movie."
37320,39280," - I actually have a lot to say about"
39280,40520," Amazon buying iRobot."
40520,42200," What else we got?"
42200,45400," - We have NCX Tales from Behind the Counter,"
45400,47280," which I'm gonna throw one in for,"
47280,49240," which is not from when I worked at NCX,"
49240,51800," but I'm gonna throw a Behind the Counter tale"
51800,53600," into the pile."
53600,54600," - Oh, okay."
54600,55440," - But you-- - But you--"
55440,56940," - That you don't know. - That you don't know."
56940,57780," - Yeah."
57780,58960," - That Linus doesn't know."
58960,59800," - I think."
59800,60640," - Okay. - I might have told you"
60640,62900," at some point, we've had a lot of conversations."
62900,66120," Also, other stuff."
66120,68280," I'm gonna throw this--"
68280,69180," - You're up as mad at me."
69180,70020," - Yeah."
70020,72480," We'll talk about why."
72480,73320," - Yeah."
73320,74320," - What's up, Europe?"
74320,75160," How you doin'?"
75160,76740," (upbeat music)"
76740,77580," (laughs)"
77580,80480," (upbeat music)"
80480,81640," - It's gonna be a good show."
81640,84220," (upbeat music)"
84220,86800," (upbeat music)"
86800,99060," - The video's brought to you, the show's brought to you"
99060,100520," by Short Form."
100520,101880," I think that was Squarespace."
101880,104700," It went by pretty quick and MSI."
104700,105700," (laughs)"
105700,106780," All right, why don't we jump right"
106780,108340," and do our first topic for the day?"
108340,111180," More trouble for Intel Arc."
111180,114120," It feels like just a few short weeks ago"
114120,116380," that we had representatives from Intel here on the show"
116380,119120," telling us that things are going swimmingly for Arc"
119120,122220," and we should be expecting a launch imminently."
122220,124020," Wait, that is exactly what happened."
124020,124860," - Yeah."
124860,126860," - That exact thing I just said."
126860,127960," - It's literally a future--"
127960,129460," - That wasn't a fever dream, right?"
129460,130300," - Nope."
130300,131140," - Like that was a thing."
131140,132100," Okay, cool."
132100,134900," Well, according to Igor's lab,"
134900,138480," as if all the other rumors of Intel's GPU misadventures"
138480,140820," haven't been bad enough for Team Blue,"
140820,143840," it now seems, according to rumors allegedly,"
143840,147540," that third parties are abandoning Arc."
147540,151620," Igor says there are lots of unsold"
151620,156020," but already produced graphics cards sitting in inventory."
156020,159980," Likely, thanks to the fall of cryptocurrency values"
159980,162500," and the scramble to keep production high"
162500,164460," to meet that prior demand."
164460,168900," Whew, that is a bad time."
168900,170740," Yeah, Anthony writes,"
170740,173700," \"Which as Linus should know, is a pretty bad time"
173700,176000," when it comes to tying up your capital."
176000,179880," As a result, Intel has been focusing first on OEM partners"
179880,182740," but they face a chicken and egg scenario."
182740,184880," In order for system integrators and OEM customers"
184880,187520," to place orders, there must first be a demand"
187520,189560," for the products to begin with."
189560,192600," But since Arc is an unknown quantity,"
192600,195160," I mean, all we've seen is the small demos"
195160,197600," that Intel has done since it's unproven."
197600,198440," - Which we could do too."
198440,201400," - There is apparently little to no interest"
201400,204260," from prominent European distributors and dealers."
204260,207340," And this was the case long before"
207340,211220," A380 benchmarks reared their ugly head."
211220,212580," There's another angle."
212580,214500," - There was still a weird way to launch it"
214500,218100," considering it's basically always been halo product"
218100,219580," and then dropping down from there."
219580,221340," And they did like the opposite, which I think--"
221340,223980," - AMD pulled it the other way once when they launched."
223980,226420," I think it was Polaris, I wanna say."
226420,227340," - Okay."
227340,229980," - Mind you, I don't think they had a high end product"
229980,232180," for that generation at all."
232180,234240," So maybe they were just pitching it as,"
234240,237000," no, no, they launched, 'cause they did 474,"
237000,238600," no, they launched the whole stack."
238600,239980," They just didn't have a high end product."
239980,240820," I remember now."
240820,241940," Nope, nope, never mind."
241940,242900," Yep, you're right."
242900,243740," - Yeah, it's weird."
243740,246300," So I think that said people off on a weird foot as well."
246300,248900," - You generally try to put your best foot forward"
248900,251520," when it comes to launching a generation of products."
251520,253180," Now, there's another angle here."
253180,257180," Intel allegedly didn't want to give price guarantees"
257180,260500," and the conditions around RMA returns"
260500,262140," were worse than their competitors,"
262140,265020," which is a tough pill to swallow for system integrators"
265020,267620," whose margins, at least on desktop computers,"
267620,269060," are off and low."
269060,270460," You know what I wanna know?"
270460,274420," I wanna know where these RMA conditions"
274420,276460," for returns are coming from,"
276460,279660," because back at NCIX, we couldn't return jack-of-it."
279660,281700," When we bought something, it was ours."
281700,283580," (laughing)"
283580,285300," How did we get hosts so hard?"
285300,286700," Is it 'cause we were Canadian?"
287700,289540," That sucks."
289540,290380," - They're pretty good jokes."
290380,292340," - Okay, to be clear, we did occasionally get"
292340,294060," stock rotation and price protection,"
294060,296460," but once you committed to having something,"
296460,299020," you pretty much had it."
299020,301940," If I was Intel though, I would recognize"
301940,304220," that I'm going to have to offer price protection"
304220,306140," of some sort for these Arc GPUs,"
306140,308380," because if I was a reseller,"
308380,309620," I mean, I remember going through this"
309620,312100," back when we did the original WAN hoodie,"
312100,314380," and our strategy for international sales"
314380,316620," was working through resellers."
316620,320300," And we basically had to bend over"
320300,322500," in order to get the thing in stock in the store,"
322500,323660," because they were sitting there going,"
323660,324900," \"Well, if we don't sell it,"
324900,326980," then we want this to be entirely your problem."
326980,328980," We want you to cover shipping back to you,"
328980,333100," take back the entire thing for the entire value.\""
333100,335460," And because we were just small"
335460,337540," and had absolutely no leverage whatsoever,"
337540,340020," we pretty much had to take whatever offer was given to us."
340020,345020," So hilariously, we had, I think, three partners,"
345020,346580," I wanna say."
346580,348180," It was either two or three, I can't remember."
348180,349020," - It's been a long time."
349020,350260," - I think we had three partners though,"
350260,352740," and the only one that didn't manage to sell through,"
352740,355980," and that we did end up taking inventory back from was NCIX."
355980,356820," (laughing)"
356820,357940," Yeah, I know, right?"
357940,361260," They weren't even the ones"
361260,363060," that gave me a really hard time about terms."
363060,365020," I just told them, like, \"Look, just don't worry,"
365020,366220," we'll get it taken care of.\""
366220,367740," And then they just didn't sell it."
367740,370060," They'd, I mean, not send CIX, right?"
370060,372580," And just, yeah, if your product sells itself, then great,"
372580,373420," you'll be fine."
373420,375620," And if it doesn't, they have to actually do any work,"
375620,377180," and it could be a challenge."
377180,378700," The site was so bad, man."
378700,380420," - It was atrocious, yeah."
380420,383740," - Anyway, without interest from commercial customers then,"
383740,386460," board partners are kind of left out in the cold."
386460,389140," I mean, man, if you guys have been following along"
389140,390940," with the screwdriver and the backpack saga,"
390940,393620," I mean, these are relatively uncomplicated products"
393620,396300," compared to, well, first you've got this,"
396300,400180," this highly complex integrated circuit, right?"
400180,402660," You've got this ASIC, right?"
402660,406860," Then you've got the highly complex board designs,"
406860,408500," the development that goes on around those,"
408500,410420," the mass production that has to happen"
410420,412660," in order to reach the kind of scale"
412660,415020," that it even makes any sense economically"
415020,417620," to produce these things, then there's the distribution."
417620,419140," You gotta kind of, you gotta kind of"
419140,422540," bet, move all your pieces into play globally."
422540,425060," You gotta bet on where people are gonna buy these things"
425060,426540," and which ones they're gonna buy"
426540,430140," and what volumes, like, it's so, it's so complicated."
430140,433220," Now, all of this has to take place in the years"
433220,435620," and then months and then weeks leading up"
435620,438500," to actually pressing go, this is available."
438500,440580," And it's all gotta be basically perfect"
440580,442580," or you end up looking like an amateur, right?"
442580,444340," 'Cause you're going up against AMD and Nvidia"
444340,446100," who've been doing this for decades."
446100,446940," - Yeah."
446940,449420," - So without interest from commercial customers,"
449420,450940," board partners are left out in the cold"
450940,454780," and one has allegedly halted production altogether."
454780,457460," And this is due to quality concerns."
458940,460860," Whether these rumors are true or not,"
460860,463580," they are emblematic of the challenges faced"
463580,465980," by anyone attempting to enter the GPU market"
465980,467560," in this day and age."
467560,471580," Without a clear value proposition or brand recognition,"
471580,473680," SIs are gonna have a tough time accepting it."
473680,475740," Without SIs accepting it, board partners"
475740,477420," are less likely to hop on board"
477420,478900," and without performance leadership"
478900,481180," or aggressive back end agreements on pricing,"
481180,482780," especially price protection."
482780,485460," Not to mention RMA support,"
485460,487380," neither situation is likely to change."
487380,491820," So the cycle continues until either until blinks"
491820,494380," or the proverbial plug gets pulled."
494380,496940," Now we do have some discussion questions here"
496940,498580," and I don't like this first one."
498580,500220," Is art gonna be another Laraby?"
500220,505220," I don't think that's a realistic outcome at this point."
505220,510460," Like I think, I do think Intel is a smart enough company"
510460,512980," to not go completely sunk cost fallacy."
512980,514340," Well, we've already put billions in."
514340,516500," What's another few billion?"
516500,520100," But it is very clear from a strategic standpoint"
520100,525100," that having a GPU play is what the A players do today."
525100,530140," You must have, in addition to your X86 compute product,"
530140,532580," you must have a GPU compute product."
532580,536980," And it's also clear from AMD and Nvidia's strategy"
536980,541140," that in order to hit the kind of volumes that you need,"
541140,543340," you want a consumer product."
543340,547260," You don't just want it to be a data center compute product,"
547260,549900," which is ultimately where Laraby ended up,"
549900,551180," if I recall correctly."
551180,552460," Yeah."
552460,554140," So I don't see it happening."
554140,557660," I think Intel has to go down this path,"
557660,561380," even if it's like beating their heads and games."
561380,563460," Whoa, in order to get there,"
563460,565620," even if it takes another three years."
565620,568820," I think it sucks."
568820,570660," I don't remember the exact problem."
570660,572380," There was some type of problem"
572380,574580," which is causing a lot of these performance issues."
574580,575980," We talked about it last week."
575980,577380," I don't remember exactly what it was,"
577380,579460," but I think that's like really unfortunate,"
579460,582020," especially considering that you would kind of hope"
582020,583820," that with the pedigree that they brought on board,"
583820,586140," that they would have been able to avoid something like that."
586140,589140," But it is extremely technical concepts"
589140,590980," and it's not like they can exactly just copy paste"
590980,592900," what these guys have done in the past."
592900,594180," Yeah, I don't think it's--"
594180,597660," Raja Kaduri recreated."
597660,600420," Yeah, that would be a big problem."
600420,602020," So you can't exactly do that."
602020,604020," So you're going to run into some issues."
604020,607300," It's unfortunate, but I do agree with Linus."
607300,609500," I think they're going to try to make it work."
609500,612300," I hope, they're going to try to make it work."
612300,613220," I hope you're right."
613220,614500," Yeah, I don't know."
614500,617020," We'll see."
617020,619980," There's another discussion question here,"
619980,621340," courtesy of Anthony Gamers,"
621340,624100," probably share the concerns around pricing,"
624100,627300," RMA, and driver support that system integrators do."
627300,629340," How will this impact the role of early adopters?"
629340,631820," I think early adopters are absolutely critical"
631820,634340," to ARK and from talking to Shrout and Tap about it,"
634340,636380," they seem to understand that they're going to have"
636380,639340," to be priced very aggressively to drive"
639340,640740," some of that early adoption."
640740,643740," But if they don't have the buy-in from upper management,"
643740,647940," if they don't have tens, hundreds of millions,"
647940,652940," a billion bucks to just kind of get some ARK GP freakin' use"
652940,655900," out there into users' hands."
655900,657140," Do they even really want to,"
657140,659460," if it has a lot of issues with this generation?"
659460,660460," I think if--"
660460,662180," And they produce them allegedly."
662180,663020," Yeah."
663020,667260," Supposedly, they just have wafers upon wafers upon wafers"
667260,668100," of ARK GP use."
668100,668940," But then they're going to have to make them"
668940,670020," incredibly cheap if there is--"
670020,674260," Yeah, you don't just grind them up, make new GPUs."
674260,675100," Although."
675100,676940," (laughing)"
676940,679020," The biggest recycling effort ever."
679020,679940," Yeah, exactly."
679940,682620," Don't bury it in the desert like the ET video game."
682620,684580," I actually grind them up and make new ones."
687140,689940," Yeah, I, we'll see."
689940,693060," There was a comment earlier about like no brand recognition."
693060,695300," I don't think that's fair at all."
695300,697300," Because it's going to have Intel on it."
697300,699620," And people that are building computers know who Intel is."
699620,703820," And Intel's onboard graphics to their credit"
703820,707620," have gotten a lot better in the last five years."
707620,710980," I mean, continually, they've gotten continuously better"
710980,714020," ever since they introduced them back."
714020,716180," Well, I shouldn't say introduced them, but--"
716180,719100," Okay, sorry, Jane just said something in full-plane chat."
719100,722660," If they allow VGPU, they'll move them."
722660,724060," Yeah, there's absolutely--"
724060,725260," Like 100%."
725260,726740," So, strategic levers they can pull."
726740,729660," And EposVox did a video recently talking"
729660,731140," about their AV1 encoder."
731140,732220," I haven't watched the video yet."
732220,734180," I do need to watch it, but I did at least make it"
734180,735020," to the headline."
735020,736900," Apparently, it's outstanding."
736900,739820," Like it is, it is a better video encoder."
739820,744540," So as long as OBS get support for Intel's AV1 encoder,"
744540,747660," I could see a bunch of streamers just throwing it"
747660,750500," in addition to their NVIDIA GPU, just so"
750500,751700," that they have AV1 encoding."
751700,752820," That would actually be pretty cool,"
752820,754700," because then you can lift a lot of the--"
754700,758100," It hasn't really been worth it to have a dedicated"
758100,759900," and vent card."
759900,763020," But it could be if it's actually really killer--"
763020,764420," Yeah, if it's legitimately better."
764420,766180," I mean, remember, too, we're talking"
766180,769060," about people that will build an entire separate machine"
769060,771860," so that they can use CPU encoding for the best possible"
771860,772820," quality."
772820,775660," If AV1 meant you just don't have to do that,"
775660,778460," although there are other reasons to use a separate machine,"
778460,779820," like if your game crashes."
779820,781580," It means your stream doesn't crash, et cetera, et cetera."
781580,782580," It means it's a bit of stability stuff, yeah."
782580,784900," But if money is no object, or if maybe it's"
784900,787820," some money is a partial object, that tier,"
787820,792660," if just adding one of these arc cards for 130, 140 bucks,"
792660,795420," getting that AV1 encoding means that your stream will just"
795420,797780," immediately look sharper, look better."
797780,799300," I could absolutely see people doing that."
799300,802780," Sick, yeah, if that's genuinely really good"
802780,805020," and they have VGPU support, they'll move them."
805020,806580," 100% they'll move them."
806580,809020," There's a comment from Anthony saying,"
809020,810620," regarding brand recognition, it's"
810620,813980," more about the Intel HD graphics being poor performers"
813980,815500," and people generally seeing Intel graphics"
815500,816620," as low in a bare bones."
816620,821380," That's fair, but I do also think that Intel is like a household"
821380,824500," name that people trust."
824500,826940," And maybe if you're very technical"
826940,829020," and you've messed around with the Intel HD graphics"
829020,831860," a bunch and stuff like that, then you have that opinion."
831860,834740," But if you're just someone who you like building"
834740,838340," your own computers, you build one every three, four years,"
838340,842260," and you've had Intel chips since you were fairly young,"
842260,844780," I think it's going to hit for those people."
844780,847100," And then on the other end, like we've just been saying now,"
847100,850500," there might be specific scenarios where, with the highly"
850500,853060," technical people, it just it's slays."
853060,855180," And I don't know."
855180,856900," We try to tell them here."
856900,858940," I don't even try to tell them again."
858940,859780," You'll solve it."
859780,861300," In my opinion, they'll solve your problems"
861300,862620," if you enable VGPU."
862620,864460," One of the issues with that is it's"
864460,867980," going to be hard to take it back with BattleMage or whatever"
867980,868820," the ones are after that."
868820,869620," Oh, it would be really hard."
869620,870140," Oh, yeah."
870140,877620," So, you know, I think you shouldn't, to be fair."
877620,879740," I think you should just send it out there"
879740,883780," and just leave it out there and just drop it on the table."
883780,886540," Be like, hey, we're actually doing it."
886540,888300," We might have cars that have issues,"
888300,889660," but we have this enabled."
889660,891100," People are going to buy it."
891100,893380," And if the competition doesn't answer to this,"
893380,896820," we'll just take our piece of the pie and run with it."
896820,898260," But I don't know."
898260,900820," All right, let's jump into a couple of merch messages"
900820,903620," very, very early on because naturally,"
903620,907700," the big news for us this week was we finally,"
907700,911860," finally launched the LTT backpack."
911860,913300," Woo!"
913300,913900," Thank you."
913900,916540," Massive shout out to everyone who ordered one."
916540,917220," It's hilarious."
917220,921180," Everyone who watched the video internally is like, hey,"
921180,923980," when are the staff ones going out?"
923980,926100," And I'm like, oh, not soon."
926100,928820," OK, they're going to pay customers first, guys."
928820,930180," There was people from Flow Play that"
930180,932380," asked if we're getting like backpacks and screwdrivers."
932380,933980," And I was like, I seriously doubt it."
933980,935300," Because I did the math."
935300,937540," And I was like--"
937540,938780," And then you sent that message."
938780,941580," And I was like, oh, OK."
941580,942100," Yeah."
942100,942900," I guess so."
942900,944060," We're going to do it."
944060,945820," But it's going to take some time."
945820,946740," It's going to take some time."
946740,947740," I've got to--"
947740,948820," Stock needs to stabilize stuff like that."
948820,951180," Anyway, we can do a couple of merch messages now."
951180,953540," If you guys want to send in a merch message anytime"
953540,956580," or live when you're checking out on LTTstore.com,"
956580,958900," you can check that you want to send a merch message."
958900,959860," Enter your merch message."
959860,961540," It'll either pop up down here."
961540,965820," It's our replacement for super chats or bits on Twitch"
965820,966900," or anything like that."
966900,970180," Because this way, instead of just throwing money into a void,"
970180,971740," you can throw it into a void."
971740,975340," And the void will spit out a high quality t-shirt or backpack"
975340,979140," or hoodie or whatever else it is that you happen to need."
979140,983460," And it'll arrive at your door eventually, depending"
983460,984380," on where you are."
984380,985900," All right, hit me, Bell."
985900,988540," From Jack, been following the backpack for a while"
988540,990980," and loved the unboxing on Short Circuit."
990980,991580," Hey, thanks."
991580,993540," With a thought of other LTT products working"
993540,995700," with the backpack, do you expect to release products that"
995700,999220," directly work with a backpack such as hooks or lockers"
999220,1002140," or carabiners or weight people ask what rain covers?"
1002140,1003700," OK."
1003700,1007820," So I've seen quite a few requests for a rain cover."
1007820,1010780," If we can find something that folds up compactly enough"
1010780,1013860," that it could fit in the hidden passport pocket,"
1013860,1016500," I would love to have a rain cover that kind of sits in there"
1016500,1018620," and then you can pull it out in an emergency."
1018620,1021220," So you swap the luggage strap for that"
1021220,1022740," is basically what you're saying?"
1022740,1023500," Yeah, exactly."
1023500,1024980," There wouldn't be a place for your luggage strap"
1024980,1026740," at that point, but let me just store it somewhere."
1026740,1028260," It can't hold everything."
1028260,1029260," Yeah."
1029260,1031140," [LAUGHING]"
1031140,1033180," I'd absolutely love to do a rain cover."
1033180,1037260," We are already working on some attachments for the front."
1037260,1037780," Whoop."
1037780,1038220," Front."
1038220,1039820," I think I just saw a secret thing."
1039820,1040340," Yeah."
1040340,1042500," We are already working on some attachments for the front"
1042500,1044340," for things like--"
1044340,1049100," oh, man, Matthew has this adorable little wireless headphones"
1049100,1050940," holder that we'll clip on right here."
1050940,1052540," So it'll just sit right here so you can just"
1052540,1053580," tuck your wireless headphones in."
1053580,1058620," It's big enough for AirPods Pros in a case or a large bulky one"
1058620,1059860," like the Sennheiser's."
1059860,1061460," And this will probably be one of those things"
1061460,1064220," where it fits best on this backpack."
1064220,1064660," Oh, yeah."
1064660,1067460," But it'll work on anything that has like--"
1067460,1072100," We definitely want to keep our accessories generic"
1072100,1075580," in terms of their compatibility with other bags if we can."
1075580,1079460," The last thing you want to do is make something that then is"
1079460,1080460," married--"
1080460,1084820," OK, even if I think these things are going to last you 10 years,"
1084820,1086740," they're not invincible."
1086740,1090100," So if you'd be able to carry on some of the accessories"
1090100,1093140," to a future bag, then great."
1093140,1096060," Even if it's a future bag that we potentially make."
1096060,1097860," Yeah, whether it's us or whether it's someone else."
1097860,1100940," Or if you find a use for it that isn't even a bag."
1100940,1103140," So that's something we're working on."
1103140,1107580," Another cool one is this."
1107580,1111900," We recognize that not everyone is necessarily"
1111900,1117340," going to prefer just that compartment of holding,"
1117340,1122660," as I like to call it, the uninterrupted place"
1122660,1124060," to stuff everything."
1124060,1126420," So this is an accessory that we are currently"
1126420,1129100," working on that's going to be called the TechPouch."
1129100,1132940," It's built to the same standard of quality as the backpack,"
1132940,1137100," which means we've got entirely unnecessary reinforced"
1137100,1139100," stitching on the handle on the end."
1139100,1143660," It uses waterproof zippers, even though--"
1143660,1148140," come on, get real, this has to be rain proof."
1148140,1149500," But it dies anyway."
1149500,1151100," And then this is really cool."
1151100,1155580," So it opens up into an accordion style thing that"
1155580,1157300," is just chock full of Danny."
1157300,1158380," You're trying to do something here?"
1158380,1160300," Should I be switching to that camera?"
1160300,1161900," Should I be switching to the loop cam?"
1161900,1162820," Yeah, here you go."
1162820,1165980," So it's got a little spot for our pens."
1165980,1168420," We only have one spot for a pen, like a native spot"
1168420,1171980," for a pen in the backpack as it is."
1171980,1173340," This is an earlier version."
1173340,1175740," We actually already have a newer version than this one"
1175740,1179940," that has changed this to either two medium sized ones"
1179940,1181020," or one big and one small."
1181020,1181700," I can't remember."
1181700,1186300," But I just found this three by small configuration"
1186300,1187420," was not that useful."
1187420,1188740," I need to take my--"
1188740,1189300," you know what?"
1189300,1189740," No, it's fine."
1189740,1190740," I'll just leave that in there for now."
1190740,1191940," That is an old school flash drive."
1191940,1193740," Yeah, I know, right?"
1193740,1197660," These are supposed to be knitted."
1197660,1199660," So when they're knitted, these are going to be stretchy."
1199660,1201780," And then this is supposed to be elastic at the top."
1201780,1203820," So there's a stretchy thing here."
1203820,1207460," And then you can also undo the zipper here."
1207460,1208940," There's a zipper thing."
1208940,1211540," Basically, you can just kind of cram it"
1211540,1213620," with whatever you want."
1213620,1216140," There's another thing of--"
1216140,1217540," so this would also be--"
1217540,1218020," I forget."
1218020,1220180," One side's going to be stretchy and one side's not."
1220180,1222420," Because when you fill up the stretchy side,"
1222420,1223940," we want it to bulge out."
1223940,1225340," And when you fill up the not stretchy side,"
1225340,1228900," we want it to bulge in so that you can still fit."
1228900,1232300," The spacing of this elastic here has been changed,"
1232300,1233860," so that you can kind of put tools in it."
1233860,1235860," Or you could put like thumb drives in it."
1235860,1237500," You can kind of put whatever you want in it."
1237500,1239060," And then it'll also be tighter."
1239060,1240300," Because right now, it's a little loose."
1240300,1241660," So once it wears out a bit, it's going"
1241660,1243740," to have a hard time holding things in place."
1243740,1246340," But this is basically exactly the width"
1246340,1250620," of the bottom of the chamber of holding, pouch of holding,"
1250620,1251500," or whatever."
1251500,1253420," And it'll just kind of sit there."
1253420,1254900," And then the idea is that because it's"
1254900,1258020," made of that same sturdy, reprieve fabric,"
1258020,1262660," you just kind of roll up, put it on your desk."
1262660,1264020," And it just stands on its own."
1264020,1267420," You can get whatever you need, put all your stuff back away,"
1267420,1272060," whether it's like tools or USB drives, or your testers,"
1272060,1274020," or whatever it is that you're using."
1274020,1275500," And then you tuck it away."
1275500,1278100," So that's something."
1278100,1279060," That's something."
1279060,1280060," Cool."
1280060,1282460," You could also use it for toiletries and stuff like that."
1282460,1284220," Yeah, people have clued in that, yeah,"
1284220,1286580," it could also be great for travel."
1286580,1287780," So we're working on that."
1287780,1289140," When is--"
1289140,1290140," No idea."
1290140,1291540," Yeah, can't promise anything."
1291540,1291980," Sounds good."
1291980,1295460," I should even be showing it to you."
1295460,1298340," I was wondering, when you put it over there, I was like,"
1298340,1300540," I've never seen this before or heard of it."
1300540,1302620," Yeah."
1302620,1305140," It'll absolutely work stand alone,"
1305140,1308540," but it's kind of made to sit in the back."
1308540,1312660," Yeah, that's a good idea to do everything that way, right?"
1312660,1314060," You could use it without it."
1314060,1316380," You don't even have to use that with a bag, technically."
1316380,1319180," Like you said, it could just be like a travel thing."
1319180,1319820," Yeah, exactly."
1319820,1321340," Whatever."
1321340,1322220," That would have been the car."
1322220,1323700," Questions from Brian."
1323700,1326060," Could the lab possibly do USB hub reviews?"
1326060,1328780," Everyone I've purchased has been terrible."
1328780,1331740," I think that's a fantastic idea."
1331740,1334020," I don't even know where we'd begin."
1334020,1339220," I mean, obviously, you'd want to know how hot it gets"
1339220,1341980," when you're pulling the maximum amount of power"
1341980,1343300," that it can support."
1343300,1347940," You'd want to know what its internal inefficiencies are."
1347940,1349900," So if you could test how much power"
1349900,1352820," you could draw with a device that's actually plugged in"
1352820,1356380," on the other side of it, you'd want"
1356380,1359140," to create some kind of like a torture test, right?"
1359140,1363020," Where you have data streaming over--"
1363020,1368900," let's say it was a USB-C hub, right, that has HDMI and also"
1368900,1370420," USB type A's or something."
1370420,1373580," So if you have some kind of data storm going on over the USB"
1373580,1376500," ports, does the HDMI cut out?"
1376500,1378060," You know, I'd want to know things like that."
1378060,1378460," Yeah."
1378460,1379820," That is a good question, because that's"
1379820,1381420," one of those types of things where"
1381420,1384300," if you go on Amazon or whatever and you want to buy one,"
1384300,1388180," there's just like a billion of them."
1388180,1389260," How are you supposed to know?"
1389260,1391140," The brand recognition isn't going to be there."
1391140,1395580," It's from like 30,000 brands you've never heard of."
1395580,1396060," Yeah."
1396060,1396780," Yeah, I don't know."
1396780,1398220," That would be one of the things that I"
1398220,1401740," would like there to be some kind of like answers for."
1401740,1405420," Yeah, if we could find a way, I'd love to."
1405420,1407580," I get so frustrated."
1407580,1409060," I get so frustrated."
1409060,1411540," We went through this with dashcams recently."
1411540,1414700," We actually have a video coming where we bought every $100"
1414700,1420620," and under the top $100 and under dashcams on Amazon."
1420620,1422460," Because I just-- I went on the site."
1422460,1425020," I'm like, I don't understand."
1425020,1428020," Most of these reviews are obviously fake."
1428020,1431220," But they all are rated pretty well."
1431220,1434740," And even some of the real users seem to say,"
1434740,1436020," it's really good."
1436020,1441340," So why do $300 dashcams exist if there are $70 dashcams?"
1441340,1443740," Like, it was just-- it was overwhelming,"
1443740,1446180," even as a tech savvy person."
1446180,1447700," It was absolutely overwhelming."
1447700,1450180," So I kind of went, well, conveniently,"
1450180,1453100," I'm in a position where I can commission my own independent"
1453100,1454180," test."
1454180,1457020," I need a frickin' dashcam."
1457020,1461420," You buy all the dashcams, and then let's share our findings"
1461420,1462020," with the people."
1462020,1463980," So that video is coming pretty soon."
1463980,1464580," But you actually--"
1464580,1465380," That's really cool."
1465380,1468500," I will genuinely, very likely, buy one based off that video."
1468500,1470940," That's the type of things that I like, where, like,"
1470940,1475260," to be completely honest, they're almost more interesting to me"
1475260,1476900," than computer stuff reviews."
1476900,1478380," Because at this point, I can often"
1478380,1481140," suss out what I need to know about computer hardware."
1481140,1483100," But when it goes into something like dashcams,"
1483100,1485380," like USB Hub, stuff like that, and we're just like, I don't know."
1485380,1487060," Even something like a thumb drive."
1487060,1487420," Yeah."
1487420,1489940," OK, I still need a thumb drive for whatever reason."
1489940,1491660," I got to carry around a lot of ISO's."
1491660,1492660," So you know, it's cool."
1492660,1494940," Whatever."
1494940,1495940," How do you know if it's good?"
1495940,1496540," Which one?"
1496540,1497420," Which one's good?"
1497420,1498260," Yeah."
1498260,1499260," Cables."
1499260,1499740," Yeah, it's cool."
1499740,1501420," Cables are going to be huge."
1501420,1504260," That's going to be the main tertiary product thing."
1504260,1507100," I'm very excited about the cables."
1507100,1509740," Well, the ones that we're planning to make or the testing--"
1509740,1511540," The testing, mostly, to be completely honest."
1511540,1511940," Yeah, that's fine."
1511940,1513700," But then I'm hoping that the ones that we make"
1513700,1516020," are some of the best ones that come through testing."
1516020,1517180," I should hope so."
1517180,1519540," If they're not, then we suck and we need to start over."
1519540,1520060," Yeah."
1520060,1523340," See, this is hilarious."
1523340,1526380," Scali over in Twitch chat says Garmin makes decent dashcams."
1526380,1527700," No, they don't."
1527700,1529420," I see, I would have thought that too."
1529420,1531500," Garmin's like a brand name, right?"
1531500,1533100," Like they're a trusted name."
1533100,1534060," They made GPS's a--"
1534060,1535980," That is a direction that I would likely go in."
1535980,1537060," Exactly."
1537060,1539100," And instead, no, it turned out it just"
1539100,1542780," cost another $10, $20 and was not better at all."
1542780,1543780," All righty then."
1543780,1544740," Great."
1544740,1546020," Now I know, but I didn't."
1546020,1550100," And it's so hard to tell because your intuition might"
1550100,1552420," tell you this."
1552420,1555820," But then when you go empirically test it and you go, oh, yeah,"
1555820,1557180," I can't see Jack at night."
1557180,1557660," Oh, great."
1557660,1560020," Well, it's good to-- it's really good to know, isn't it?"
1560020,1560620," No, for sure."
1560620,1561660," Oh, really?"
1561660,1562500," Everyone's using--"
1562500,1562980," It's going to be a bigger sensor."
1562980,1566220," Everyone's using one of the same two Chinese chipsets."
1566220,1568820," Oh, all right then."
1568820,1569700," That's interesting."
1569700,1570580," That's very interesting."
1570580,1571700," That's not something that you're going"
1571700,1573660," to actually figure out in any other way."
1573660,1576340," No, no, not at all."
1576340,1579420," You're going to tear down some fanboy fences with that one."
1579420,1581460," I think there's already people charming and like,"
1581460,1583420," the anchor, the garment, whatever."
1583420,1584980," And it's like, hmm, we'll see."
1584980,1586220," Yeah, we'll see."
1586220,1586660," We'll see."
1586660,1588420," Cobra."
1588420,1590900," Related to that, I asked if there's"
1590900,1593580," any plans for the labs to release a spreadsheet, list,"
1593580,1595980," or ranking chart for the products you test,"
1595980,1596940," whether it's paid or free."
1600860,1602940," Yeah."
1602940,1604020," I don't know."
1604020,1607460," I still have to sit down with a lot of people from labs"
1607460,1613460," that have experience related websites"
1613460,1615580," and figure out exactly what we're going to do,"
1615580,1618580," because we've been waiting to get development on staff."
1618580,1621180," But there was paperwork signed yesterday."
1621180,1621780," Really?"
1621780,1622980," OK."
1622980,1623660," Done deal."
1623660,1624340," Love to hear it."
1624340,1626780," So very soon, it'll technically"
1626780,1629180," be before that person actually starts."
1629180,1630980," But I want to get these meetings started anyways,"
1630980,1632100," and he's volunteered."
1632100,1634620," So we're going to have a call just to go over some"
1634620,1637220," of the road mapping stuff before he actually starts"
1637220,1638940," so that we can start doing design,"
1638940,1641740," so that we can start hitting it hard right when he's"
1641740,1643100," actually full time."
1643100,1645020," Can I tell you something wild?"
1645020,1645380," Sorry."
1645380,1646220," Hold that thought."
1646220,1650300," I want to hear the rest of what you're about to say thing."
1650300,1654820," You manage a larger team now than I did when we moved"
1654820,1656140," into this building."
1656140,1656500," Nice."
1657380,1659780," And there's a lot more coming."
1659780,1661780," [LAUGHTER]"
1661780,1663780," By the way, if you just heard that contract thing--"
1663780,1664780," Yeah, by backpacks."
1664780,1665780," Sorry."
1665780,1666780," Yeah, fair."
1666780,1668940," If you just heard that contract thing,"
1668940,1669900," you're like, what?"
1669900,1670540," I didn't get it."
1670540,1672260," I'm still working on it."
1672260,1673740," I need a few of you guys, not just one."
1673740,1675260," [GASPS]"
1675260,1676260," So--"
1676260,1678260," [SIGHS]"
1678260,1679180," Yeah."
1679180,1681220," In summary, yes."
1681220,1682940," Our intention in the long--"
1682940,1684020," I mean, screw it."
1684020,1686700," Should I just bring up the dock?"
1686700,1687220," No."
1687220,1687720," No."
1687720,1691380," No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
1691380,1692420," No."
1692420,1693340," I'm serious."
1693340,1694260," Do not."
1694260,1698100," There are things on there we're not showing."
1698100,1700660," No."
1700660,1701540," What is it?"
1701540,1702100," No."
1702100,1703980," I'm getting a maybe vibe."
1703980,1705620," I will switch off."
1705620,1707700," I will switch the camera off his screen."
1707700,1709060," I'm getting a maybe vibe."
1709060,1710500," I'm getting a maybe vibe."
1710500,1710940," No."
1710940,1713580," What do you think?"
1713580,1716820," OK, can I at least talk about MVP?"
1716820,1717660," Yes."
1717660,1718980," OK, I will tell you what."
1718980,1720540," Why don't you talk about MVP?"
1720540,1721140," OK."
1721140,1721620," OK."
1721620,1723340," I thought you were going to say, why don't I just"
1723340,1724100," show that part of the screen?"
1724100,1724940," Yeah, why don't I just show that part?"
1724940,1725940," No."
1725940,1727780," [LAUGHTER]"
1727780,1730460," The chat screaming do it."
1730460,1731300," Oh, my goodness."
1731300,1733580," Someone calling me to prevent this?"
1733580,1734380," Line is speaking."
1734380,1741100," I don't know what this is."
1741100,1741860," I didn't see the game."
1741860,1742580," No, definitely spam."
1742580,1743580," OK."
1743580,1745580," That's a hilarious spam call."
1745580,1746460," It started with--"
1746460,1747220," It started with--"
1747220,1748980," Yo."
1748980,1751300," We're all out of vaccines."
1751300,1756380," And then I hung out because it was obviously very stupid."
1756380,1762380," I was going to say MVP is minimally viable product."
1762380,1764020," Sure, yeah."
1764020,1769100," It's not technically 100% locked down."
1769100,1771820," The general features are, which is what's on that sheet,"
1771820,1774540," but exactly what the site will actually look like is not"
1774540,1776340," 100% locked down."
1776340,1777780," We still have to nail that in."
1777780,1778940," So you want me to read it, or do I"
1778940,1780020," need to share this with you?"
1780020,1780460," Or like--"
1780460,1781580," I don't share it with me."
1781580,1783380," OK, I'm not going to share it with you."
1783380,1784940," It's mostly--"
1784940,1788220," I actually might have to see it."
1788220,1790580," Yeah, you can see-- there you go."
1790580,1793420," Yeah, it's essentially like the MVP,"
1793420,1794860," to be completely honest, is essentially"
1794860,1797860," like a really fancy blog."
1797860,1800860," Because that's what it is, right?"
1800860,1801860," You're reading."
1801860,1804060," So there will be reviews."
1804060,1807580," We're going to try to make sure that the search is very strong."
1807580,1810420," The fuzziness of the search is very good."
1810420,1812420," So you can find things that you're looking for."
1812420,1815100," There's all going to be categorized to some degree."
1815100,1818180," You want to be able to generate and display graphs"
1818180,1819660," and tables, obviously."
1819660,1821740," Which already sort of works."
1821740,1823860," It just needs to work on the website as well."
1823860,1827260," We can't be painstakingly graphing things"
1827260,1828580," and making tables by hand."
1828580,1830580," Like we do on the video production side of things."
1830580,1834460," And yeah, they might not be as pretty, but they need to be fast."
1834460,1837500," I'm going to be taking in goals and desires"
1837500,1840500," from a lot of different people on the technical side of labs"
1840500,1842900," so we can figure out what they want on the website."
1842900,1846220," I could tell you one of the really wild things they want."
1846220,1850340," I had a chat with Gary recently, or someone did."
1850340,1852660," Somehow this floated back to me."
1852660,1855740," And apparently, the target maximum throughput"
1855740,1860380," for headphone testing is 50 a month."
1860380,1862780," So yeah."
1862780,1866740," So hopefully you guys are ready to store a lot of data."
1866740,1867700," Well, that's--"
1867700,1868380," And graph it."
1868380,1868860," Yeah."
1868860,1871300," Yeah, I just mean like that's a fricking lot of headphones."
1871300,1872260," Yeah, that's fine."
1872260,1873620," Are there even that many headphones?"
1873620,1875100," I think you're going to run out of headphones."
1875100,1876700," Yeah, I think we're going to run out of headphones"
1876700,1878580," before we run out of testing throughput."
1878580,1879740," Yeah."
1879740,1881180," What was I going to say?"
1881180,1882900," Yeah, but so one of my two--"
1882900,1886060," OK, two core concepts that I'm going to try to champion."
1886060,1890060," One of them is that it needs to not be overwhelming"
1890060,1892460," and intimidating when you land on the website."
1892460,1895260," And when you're looking through the website, to be honest,"
1895260,1898340," there should be deep, hardcore information,"
1898340,1901780," but it should feel accessible."
1901780,1903260," You shouldn't hit land on the website."
1903260,1906180," Be like, oh my goodness, this looks like a UI from the 90s."
1906180,1907820," We're going to trick you into thinking."
1907820,1909260," You can handle this data."
1909260,1909940," Pretty much."
1909940,1910540," Yeah."
1910540,1911860," But like actually, though, we want"
1911860,1914340," to make it a comfortable experience to dive really"
1914340,1916700," deeply into something, to encourage people"
1916700,1918140," to actually take that extra step."
1918140,1919420," So that's one of my things."
1919420,1923380," The other one is I want the CMS to be really strong."
1923380,1925700," The CMS is actually extremely important"
1925700,1928660," because I don't want someone to have"
1928660,1934180," to spend their whole freaking day building these articles"
1934180,1937380," because I don't know if we're writing individual articles"
1937380,1940260," for each one of those 50 headphones that we're testing"
1940260,1943060," a month."
1943060,1943620," What's all this?"
1943620,1944140," No, you're good."
1944140,1945420," You're good."
1945420,1947860," So the CMS has to be pretty strong."
1947860,1950700," If we're building a little thing like a graph or whatever,"
1950700,1954420," it should be very easy to add that, not labor intensive,"
1954420,1957100," as few clicks as possible, that type of stuff."
1957100,1959460," So there's going to be a lot of work in that regard."
1959460,1963180," We want to have product browsing by category, by tags,"
1963180,1963900," by search."
1963900,1965540," We want to have pictures and videos embedded."
1965540,1967580," We obviously want to have affiliate links working"
1967580,1969980," because they're going to pay for this."
1969980,1972140," It's so expensive."
1972140,1973060," Yeah."
1973060,1974580," We shot a video this week."
1974580,1977780," Oh, man, I'm excited for you guys to see this thing."
1977780,1981140," Have you seen the PSU tester we bought?"
1981140,1983100," I have heard that it was purchased."
1983100,1983860," I've not seen it."
1983860,1984980," It's here."
1984980,1985500," Oh, boy."
1985500,1989180," It arrived on, I think it was Tuesday or Wednesday."
1989180,1992260," And we did our unboxing video, which is an uncrating"
1992260,1993940," because it's taller than you are."
1993940,2001860," It's an entire 40 U cabinet."
2001860,2003460," Uh-huh, uh-huh."
2003460,2012540," Full of AC load generation, DC load generation, oscilloscopes,"
2012540,2013780," loads themselves."
2013780,2017220," So you need the power supply, and then you also"
2017220,2018660," need the loads."
2018660,2025380," Logging, like monitoring and logging hardware, it's packed."
2025380,2027420," It is stuffed to the gills."
2027420,2031900," It's apparently a better one than CSONIC has."
2031900,2032420," Yeah."
2032420,2034860," And they're in actual power supply manufacturers."
2034860,2036260," Yeah."
2036260,2038380," Like a lot of your favorite power supplies are probably"
2038380,2040700," once you go down to it, CSONIC."
2040700,2043540," X-Pier asks, bigger than the one gamers Nexus got?"
2043540,2044980," Yeah."
2044980,2047020," Definitely."
2047020,2047900," It's big."
2047900,2048540," We go bigger."
2048540,2049260," We go home."
2049260,2050660," It's good we had the land when we did,"
2050660,2053140," because you guys are going to fill that space up pretty quick."
2053140,2053700," Pretty quick stuff."
2053700,2055460," Considering the anechoic chamber was just"
2055460,2059700," like leaning against the wall the whole time."
2059700,2061220," I had to point that out to a couple of people,"
2061220,2062740," because I guess when it's deconstructed,"
2062740,2066140," people don't necessarily recognize what it is."
2066140,2068500," But yeah, that was pretty crazy."
2068500,2072700," Here, I'll show you the company that we got it from."
2072700,2074220," There has been a lot of mentions about getting"
2074220,2077700," a electroboom to come check out the space once it's set up."
2077700,2078860," Yeah, I mean, sure."
2078860,2079980," I'm down for whatever."
2079980,2082780," So yeah, it's basically like one of these."
2082780,2084620," So they're highly configurable."
2084620,2089580," Kyle actually did a whole bunch of research"
2089580,2091580," working with Seasonic."
2091580,2093100," And I believe--"
2093100,2094340," I'm not sure who else he talked to,"
2094340,2095900," so I'm not going to name anyone else."
2095900,2099980," But working with Seasonic, as well as engineers from Chroma,"
2099980,2104820," to ensure that we have exactly what we need for the ultimate--"
2104820,2107660," the ultimate configuration for testing PC power supplies,"
2107660,2109660," because they make gear for testing all kinds of stuff"
2109660,2113100," batteries, any kind of power system."
2113100,2115260," And the only piece that we don't have yet,"
2115260,2122860," the only piece that was not included in our $133,000"
2122860,2124140," was an oscilloscope."
2124140,2128220," So once we get the scope in the front of it,"
2128220,2129300," that price tag goes--"
2129300,2132460," [LAUGHTER]"
2132460,2133580," Goes up a little bit."
2133580,2134740," Goes up a little bit."
2134740,2135540," Oh, boy."
2135540,2137500," No, we're not going to be blowing any breakers."
2137500,2139980," The plug on it's like this big."
2139980,2142220," It's got its own special plug."
2142220,2144100," There's a lot of power in that building."
2144100,2144740," Yeah."
2144740,2146100," Oh, there's tons of power in that building."
2146100,2148780," I mean, we ran a 200-plus person land in there."
2148780,2149660," No problem."
2149660,2150660," Whatever."
2150660,2151340," No problem."
2151340,2153660," Yeah."
2153660,2154900," Well, that's crazy."
2154900,2156700," Yeah, I can't wait, man."
2156700,2159300," We're going to be able to churn through--"
2159300,2163980," the capabilities of this thing are so cool."
2163980,2167460," The AC power source, for example,"
2167460,2173460," you can get it to run automated scenarios for things like, OK,"
2173460,2178580," what's it like if you're on a really crappy setup"
2178580,2181980," and someone flicks on a blender somewhere else in the house?"
2181980,2188380," So you can find out, hey, if I live in a developing country"
2188380,2190500," and my power is really inconsistent--"
2190500,2191300," There's three brownouts."
2191300,2192100," Three-put brownouts."
2192100,2192460," Yeah."
2192460,2195500," So you can create all these test scenarios"
2195500,2198340," where it'll simulate a brownout here"
2198340,2199780," and then another brownout there."
2199780,2204380," And then a really trying to remember"
2204380,2205180," what the problem is."
2205180,2208060," Certain types of motors, though, when they spin up,"
2208060,2210820," they can cause problems for other devices that"
2210820,2211820," are on the same circuit."
2211820,2214140," So you can have those spin up."
2214140,2217220," The DC-- oh, man, this is super cool."
2217220,2222900," So we have a DC power source."
2222900,2225620," And the reason for that is that it allows us"
2225620,2231100," to fake our power supply accidentally over-supply--"
2231100,2232780," like, over-volting."
2232780,2236060," So we can take whatever our power supply is outputting"
2236060,2239700," and we can actually add a little bit to make sure"
2239700,2241820," that over-voltage protection works, for example."
2241820,2244380," So we're going to be able to test safety mechanisms"
2244380,2245180," and power supplies."
2245180,2246940," If there's anything that's not safe,"
2246940,2249420," we can hook it up, run through our automated test suite,"
2249420,2251860," and it'll tell us that."
2251860,2253260," We're going to be able to chamber for it."
2253260,2257460," That will be both acoustically isolated and thermally isolated."
2257460,2259340," So we'll be able to tell you, OK,"
2259340,2263540," under different load scenarios, how loud is it going to get?"
2263540,2265580," How hot is it going to--"
2265580,2267380," how efficient is it going to be if it's"
2267380,2272060," in a particularly hot environment as the world heats up,"
2272060,2276300," I guess, that could become more and more of a concern for people."
2276300,2278780," And this one's really cool."
2278780,2286300," We have-- it's either 6 or 7 of the 400 watt loads."
2286300,2287900," And the reason that we got so many"
2287900,2291580," was actually not because we needed that much sustained load,"
2291580,2295940," but because of their transient performance."
2295940,2298220," So by having that many in parallel,"
2298220,2302820," we are able to simulate the effect of an RTX 3090"
2302820,2305740," having a momentary power draw spike."
2305740,2310620," Now, Nvidia might have kind of screwed us here"
2310620,2313180," with some even higher power draw GPUs coming."
2313180,2314380," Oh, yeah."
2314380,2316780," I mean, we won't know that for sure until it actually happens."
2316780,2320340," So we might actually have to get more of those modules to--"
2320340,2322900," There was a comment in Flowplane chat"
2322900,2328540," about hoping that we don't squeeze Steve out."
2328540,2329980," Squeeze Steve out."
2329980,2331300," Not going to happen."
2331300,2333100," No, you need multiple independent sources."
2333100,2338940," Just going to say, if anything, it should bolster,"
2338940,2340380," because then people are going to be looking"
2340380,2341740," for that type of content more."
2341740,2342300," Exactly."
2342300,2343820," We're bringing it back."
2343820,2344320," Yeah."
2344320,2345260," Bringing it back is like dead."
2345260,2348100," And we have literally always said"
2348100,2350220," that you should look at multiple reviews for products"
2350220,2350700," that you're buying."
2350700,2353500," So like, no, that's not happening."
2353500,2355780," Not a thing."
2355780,2358620," I mean, another thing too is that, yeah, this is pointed out"
2358620,2361460," by a Daphoid over in the Flowplane chat,"
2361460,2365460," is we don't intend to just focus on PC components."
2365460,2365940," That too."
2365940,2369580," I mean, one of our first hires has a ton of experience"
2369580,2372260," in mobile phone testing."
2372260,2375500," So that's not something Steve touches as far as I can tell"
2375500,2376180," at all."
2376180,2379820," In fact, doesn't he still use a dumb phone or something?"
2379820,2385220," I know last time I talked to him, he used ancient, ancient phone."
2385220,2388100," I just don't think he cares about it at all."
2388100,2390300," So we are absolutely going to be looking"
2390300,2391780," at different verticals."
2391780,2394700," And we also think that even for the things we both cover,"
2394700,2396420," there is--"
2396420,2398580," and yeah, in a lot of situations,"
2398580,2403460," validity to more than one testing methodology too."
2403460,2409140," So maybe one of us tests coolers with an artificial load."
2409140,2412860," Maybe one of us is all about embedding a thermal diode"
2412860,2413860," in the IHS."
2413860,2416900," Maybe whatever, right?"
2416900,2418740," And to be clear, that's a bad example,"
2418740,2420900," because obviously we would both care about it"
2420900,2422380," from both perspectives."
2422380,2425460," But I just mean that there is not always"
2425460,2429380," the one and only single way to test something."
2429380,2430700," I mean, OK, games."
2430700,2432420," Games are a really good example."
2432420,2436100," Maybe we really feel like, yeah, our audience"
2436100,2437940," has moved past 1080p."
2437940,2442060," So we're really focused on how good cards are for 1440p"
2442060,2443300," and up."
2443300,2445500," That could be something that could realistically happen"
2445500,2447420," in the next two to five years."
2447420,2451540," Or if we start automating custom benches,"
2451540,2455460," instead of-- or custom runs, instead of just running"
2455460,2458060," the BCaned benchmarks or something like that."
2458060,2459060," I don't know."
2459060,2460260," More sources is good."
2460260,2463500," You should read/watch both."
2463500,2464500," Yes."
2464500,2468260," And we've literally always said that."
2468260,2470860," So yeah."
2470860,2473060," One note for people who are thinking about the backpack,"
2473060,2477380," we do have a promo on right now for the WANHUTI and backpack."
2477380,2480540," So if you get a WANHUTI and a backpack at the same time,"
2480540,2482020," you save $20."
2482020,2485260," And that's only valid until tomorrow evening."
2485260,2488660," So no pressure, but you should do it."
2488660,2494660," Question here from Nathan for Luke and Linus."
2494660,2497660," What is your favorite piece of freeware or open source"
2497660,2502100," utility software, like \"9 Night\" or something else?"
2502100,2504060," Favorite piece of freeware."
2504060,2505740," I mean, we're streaming on OBS right now."
2505740,2508700," Which is going to say, I think it sort of has to be OBS."
2508700,2510260," Well, I wouldn't say favorite."
2510260,2513100," I don't have an emotional attachment to OBS."
2513100,2516420," There's a lot of stuff that's not that perfect."
2516420,2517540," I know it didn't exist."
2517540,2519740," OBS."
2519740,2525940," I mean, I was using X split before,"
2525940,2527620," and it had some problems."
2527620,2530420," But I actually kind of want to try it again,"
2530420,2531820," to be perfectly honest with you."
2531820,2532540," See where it's currently?"
2532540,2533420," Yeah, see where it's at."
2533420,2535220," They've sponsored the show a couple of times,"
2535220,2537300," and it kind of made me think, oh, yeah, X split."
2537300,2538740," I mean, I have a lifetime license for it."
2538740,2541260," I might as well, maybe I'll do a game stream at home"
2541260,2541940," or something like that."
2541940,2542740," Fire up X split."
2542740,2543900," See how it does."
2543900,2546020," Play some obsidian."
2546020,2547940," When it worked well for me, it worked great."
2547940,2548780," Or divinity, sorry."
2548780,2550780," Yeah, like there were things that X split"
2550780,2551980," did way better from the notion."
2551980,2552820," Big game from the no-shins."
2552820,2553460," It was so sick."
2553460,2553900," Back in the--"
2553900,2554700," Yes."
2554700,2555220," Yeah."
2555220,2557460," And OBS still sucks."
2557460,2559180," We also had a lot of problems with--"
2559180,2559540," We did."
2559540,2560820," But that was a long time ago."
2560820,2562700," And the when PC had a lot of gremlins."
2562700,2564380," I don't know how much of that was X split."
2564380,2565140," That's fair enough."
2565140,2567660," Just like honestly."
2567660,2570460," So, man, favorite free utilities."
2570460,2574740," I mean, you can't not mention your paint.net"
2574740,2575940," to the world."
2575940,2577540," Paint on net, notepad++."
2577540,2578300," Yeah."
2578300,2580140," Winter stat."
2580140,2581060," Back putty."
2581060,2581820," Someone said putty."
2581820,2582580," Yeah, putty."
2582580,2583380," Seven zip."
2583380,2584500," Oh, there's so many good ones."
2584500,2585100," VLC."
2585100,2586580," You already said notepad++, right?"
2586580,2586860," Yeah."
2586860,2587740," OK, heck yeah."
2587740,2589940," Love notepad++."
2589940,2590700," I actually--"
2590700,2591940," Yeah, I used to do that thing."
2591940,2593740," I think I told you about it way back in the day"
2593740,2596300," where you can overwrite all the--"
2596300,2598100," you can essentially like red-edit windows."
2598100,2600100," So anytime you even try to open notepad,"
2600100,2601460," it just opens notepad++."
2601460,2602340," No, that's hilarious."
2602340,2603660," I don't remember exactly how it works."
2603660,2604860," So I might have said something wrong there."
2604860,2607340," But it was actually really nice."
2607340,2609100," Because you should just never use notepad."
2609100,2610500," You should use notepad++."
2610500,2613980," I thought about resurrecting LSD."
2613980,2614460," Remember?"
2614460,2614900," Oh, yeah, yeah."
2614900,2616020," Looked software discoveries."
2616020,2617340," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
2617340,2620020," Chocolatey is apparently a 9-8 alternative"
2620020,2622060," that's way more powerful, way more customized."
2622060,2622380," Really?"
2622380,2624500," So I thought maybe we'd like check that out."
2624500,2628500," And then I found something really cool."
2628500,2630260," Oh no, did I misplace the name of it?"
2630260,2630940," Chocolatey software."
2630940,2632820," OK, I can't find the name of it right now."
2632820,2634940," I haven't written down somewhere."
2634940,2637620," But this is so-- this blew my mind."
2637620,2639780," There's this utility that lets you"
2639780,2642540," turn your USB drive bootable, which I know"
2642540,2645060," won't impress you yet."
2645060,2648180," But turn your USB drive bootable so that it just"
2648180,2653180," loads a list of all the ISOs that you've drag and dropped"
2653180,2654420," onto that USB."
2654420,2655060," That's cool."
2655060,2657340," So it's like the ultimate utility USB."
2657340,2659180," Wait, actually, I really like that."
2659180,2661980," You just literally drag and drop your MmTest ISO,"
2661980,2665100," your Windows install ISO, and then you just plug this thing in."
2665100,2667900," And it just goes, which one would you like?"
2667900,2668420," This one."
2668420,2669580," That reminds me a lot of--"
2669580,2671620," So cool."
2671620,2672780," No, it's not Rufus."
2672780,2673900," Ventoy, that's the one."
2673900,2677100," Geek Squad used to have this tool that"
2677100,2679740," was actually really good."
2679740,2681620," And I don't remember the name of it."
2681620,2684460," But this was back in the day when every computer had a CD"
2684460,2685140," drive."
2685140,2686820," So they were on CDs."
2686820,2690300," And you could burn the Geek Squad tool onto these CDs."
2690300,2697780," And people used to effectively sell them outside of Geek Squad"
2697780,2698940," because they were so good."
2698940,2700500," They were absolutely valuable."
2700500,2704220," And local repair shops would buy the updated versions"
2704220,2707180," of these Geek Squad CDs that were bootable."
2707180,2710820," And they had like MmTest and all these other types of things"
2710820,2711320," on them."
2711320,2712220," They were actually really good."
2712220,2713100," It was just all arranged really nicely."
2713100,2713540," Yes."
2713540,2714380," Yeah."
2714380,2715060," God."
2715060,2717860," It was nice in one place."
2717860,2719340," Yeah, Ventoy is what it's called."
2719340,2722300," Super, super cool little tool."
2722300,2725220," Yeah, that's sweet."
2725220,2727140," All right, what else we got from--"
2727140,2729100," I think we brought down Ventoy's website."
2729100,2731300," Oh, man."
2731300,2733180," MRI, yeah, Geek Squad MRI."
2733180,2734620," Way back in the day."
2734620,2736020," Way, way, way, long ago."
2736020,2738420," That used to be really genuinely good."
2738420,2741180," I have no idea if it even exists anymore."
2741180,2744300," But it was awesome back in the day."
2744300,2745500," Yeah."
2745500,2750100," From Aiden, any updates on the big, tall, or women sizes?"
2750100,2751140," Hire and spootsie."
2751140,2755640," No."
2758540,2765820," We got a lot of stuff going on."
2765820,2767660," There's always--"
2767660,2769540," it's kind of amazing how many projects"
2769540,2771580," they have rolling right now for how few people"
2771580,2774580," work at Create A Warehouse, relatively speaking."
2774580,2777180," A lot of stuff going on."
2777180,2778380," Yeah."
2778380,2780820," Yeah."
2780820,2782820," Apparently, Geek Squad still uses MRI,"
2782820,2784340," and it's still pretty cool."
2784340,2785060," All right, there you go."
2785060,2785940," That's actually good to hear."
2785940,2788300," Because I know they've outsourced a lot of their"
2788300,2789340," repair and stuff."
2789340,2791780," Like, you just plug the computers into a network connection,"
2791780,2794180," and then people fix them remotely and stuff, which kind"
2794180,2796580," of made me really sad."
2796580,2799180," But the fact that MRI is still cool is pretty sweet."
2799180,2801300," Also, high-runs, boot CD, and all that type of stuff."
2801300,2802340," There's lots of cool things."
2802340,2802980," Yeah, I don't know."
2802980,2806100," I'd be super down."
2806100,2808540," From Dominic, hey, Linus, I noticed"
2808540,2811220," wrist rest for keyboards are super boring."
2811220,2813020," Have you ever thought of creating your own wrist rest"
2813020,2815260," in the typical L2T quality install?"
2815260,2816420," We all know and love."
2817420,2820140," Why, you gotta read it like that."
2820140,2824540," So far over the top, dude."
2824540,2826500," In all seriousness, yeah, we've thought about it."
2826500,2830500," But the way that I see it, the custom keyboard market"
2830500,2831620," is so saturated."
2831620,2833220," There are so many players."
2833220,2837260," There's so many boutique wrist rests and keyboards"
2837260,2841100," and cables and all that stuff that I just--"
2841100,2844820," I feel like we'd just kind of be adding to the noise"
2844820,2845780," at a certain point."
2845780,2848700," And the reason that it's occurred to me to make that product"
2848700,2853020," is because my wife is an avid wrist rest user."
2853020,2857820," She uses a SteelSeries 7G, which has that super long wrist"
2857820,2858700," rest on it."
2858700,2861620," And she just basically won't touch any other keyboard"
2861620,2864100," because it really is way better."
2864100,2865380," And so if we were going to do one,"
2865380,2870060," it would probably be in that long, gently-inclined style."
2870060,2873700," And she also uses a wrist rest for her mouse."
2873700,2876140," But I think the mouse one would be more likely just"
2876140,2879060," because there are so many options for keyboard rest"
2879060,2883260," rests due to the explosion in enthusiasm"
2883260,2887060," for mechanical keyboards and super cool keyboards."
2887060,2890500," A mouse rest rest, I could actually see us exploring"
2890500,2894260," because the razor one that she's been using all these years,"
2894260,2895220," it's kind of disgusting."
2895220,2896260," I was going to say, is it like--"
2896260,2898540," Yeah, it's pretty gross at this point."
2898540,2903180," There's-- you maybe just haven't looked in the right spots"
2903180,2904900," or maybe deep enough or whatever."
2904900,2908700," But there's a lot of options for wrist rest."
2908700,2912980," I have this wooden one right now that's pretty sweet"
2912980,2915820," that I got from my mom for Christmas."
2915820,2919780," And I like it, but it wasn't like sealed super well."
2919780,2920460," Yeah, I know."
2920460,2921620," I know it's wearing out."
2921620,2922660," Yeah."
2922660,2924340," So it's just like--"
2924340,2924860," dang."
2924860,2927860," Because aesthetically, it's really nice in my opinion."
2927860,2928420," And then--"
2928420,2928940," No."
2928940,2930500," --it's actually-- yeah."
2930500,2932860," And then it's-- I find it quite comfortable."
2932860,2934540," I actually like that it's just solid wood."
2934540,2937700," I know not everyone would like that, but I do."
2937700,2942100," But yeah, it's like I'm like wearing through it pretty rapidly."
2942100,2945900," So that's the only disappointing part."
2945900,2947340," Now that's an interesting idea."
2947340,2951020," If we were to do a wooden one, instead of using a stain"
2951020,2952740," like they did, I think another one you're talking about."
2952740,2953500," It's kind of reddish, right?"
2953500,2954060," Is that the land?"
2954060,2954580," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
2954580,2957060," Instead of using a stain, if we used something"
2957060,2960100," like a Danish oil, then we could just like--"
2960100,2963140," man, I bet we could just do like a little--"
2963140,2964460," like a little bottle of it included."
2964460,2964980," You made it to the kit."
2964980,2966460," Yeah, a little maintenance kit."
2966460,2968140," That'd actually be sweet."
2968140,2970940," So that-- because it will wear away a little bit."
2970940,2973100," But when it does, with something like a Danish oil,"
2973100,2974500," you just recode it."
2974500,2976500," And it will actually match the surroundings even."
2976500,2978540," Like it'll still look like new."
2978540,2979740," That would be awesome."
2979740,2980580," That'd be pretty sweet."
2980580,2981460," OK, maybe we'll do it."
2981460,2982460," I'd be interested in that."
2982460,2985140," I would generate like-- yeah."
2985140,2988940," If there was that option and it was advertised as like, look,"
2988940,2990300," it looks like this."
2990300,2993420," It will change over time because it's wood"
2993420,2995020," and your hands are on it all the time."
2995020,2995020," Yeah."
2995020,2996740," But you can maintain it."
2996740,2998660," Here's how we're going to include some."
2998660,3001420," That would have sold me at the time, pretty much for sure."
3001420,3003220," Huh."
3003220,3003980," Yeah, OK."
3003980,3004500," All right."
3004500,3005700," All right, I'll think about it."
3005700,3006940," Think about it."
3006940,3009980," I did get a message from one of our labs, folks."
3009980,3012020," I don't know."
3012020,3017460," Is he off probation yet this particular one?"
3017460,3021020," I think as of like a day or two after the land, yeah."
3021020,3022100," OK."
3022100,3022620," All right."
3022620,3024860," So, well, do you know that for sure?"
3024860,3026220," Not technically 100%."
3026220,3028260," OK, then I'm not going to say it just in case."
3028260,3031260," But one of our software developers for the lab"
3031260,3034500," says, read the USB hub testing question that came up."
3034500,3035900," Yes, we can."
3035900,3038980," And Gary and I have already had a chat around testing"
3038980,3041460," USB power banks, et cetera, as well."
3041460,3041940," Good."
3041940,3044740," That's something that I really want to know."
3044740,3046900," Because you buy these things, they"
3046900,3049780," say however many milliamp hours they are."
3049780,3053540," But we all know that even on something like an iPhone, right,"
3053540,3059220," and Apple, for all their faults, does have pretty strict quality"
3059220,3060100," control."
3060100,3061980," Even on something like an iPhone, I think, is it"
3061980,3063620," plus or minus 5%?"
3063620,3064420," That's quite a bit."
3064420,3065900," For the battery capacity?"
3065900,3067100," Like, wait, I'm sorry."
3067100,3069540," What do you mean plus or minus 5%?"
3069540,3072980," So on something that might handle a screen on time of eight,"
3072980,3076860," nine hours, you mean my friend might get an extra hour?"
3076860,3077460," Sorry."
3077460,3079620," If I get the worst one and they get the best one,"
3079620,3080900," that's ridiculous."
3080900,3083140," I also have some battery banks that are still"
3083140,3088820," working from 2013 that I have thrashed."
3088820,3091060," And they have a decent amount of charge."
3091060,3093060," I'm very impressed with some of them."
3093060,3095980," And then I have a small army of other battery banks"
3095980,3097540," that are essentially decommissioned,"
3097540,3099220," because they've just completely done."
3099220,3101220," Yeah, this is another perfect example"
3101220,3103620," of one of those techy product categories"
3103620,3105380," that even as someone knowledgeable,"
3105380,3110060," you can go in and go, well, I know the reviews are horse."
3110060,3113380," I know that the specs are horse."
3113380,3117940," So I'm basically just like taking a complete shot in the dark,"
3117940,3120020," hoping that I hit something decent."
3120020,3123940," And there are brands that have built a reputation over the years."
3123940,3128180," Brands like an anchor, for example, I expect to be better."
3128180,3129460," Most my anchor ones are pretty solid."
3129460,3134860," But good brands can release a bad product"
3134860,3139860," or they can, sorry, or they can turn bad, right?"
3139860,3142820," You can have a brand that starts out good"
3142820,3145100," and then leverages that trust that they've built"
3145100,3148500," with their audience to start cranking out crap."
3148500,3150740," You've certainly seen that time and time again."
3150740,3152700," Oh yeah, definitely."
3152700,3154340," Yeah, I'm super into that."
3154340,3155420," That sounds great."
3155420,3160140," And then dad dude over on floatplane chat says,"
3160140,3162540," \"Hey, and remember too that the Milliamp Hour rating,"
3162540,3165220," \"even on an honest company spec,"
3165220,3167500," \"is based on the battery capacity,"
3167500,3169660," \"not what it will output at the ports.\""
3169660,3171820," Yes, that is true."
3171820,3173740," It also doesn't account for,"
3173740,3175180," oh, I guess this is kind of the same thing."
3175180,3178260," So any inefficiencies that exist within the design of the bank,"
3178260,3180500," any loss, well, there you go."
3180500,3183860," Also, some batteries will actually discharge"
3183860,3187740," at a less efficient, in a less efficient manner"
3187740,3190820," if they are discharging quickly compared to others."
3190820,3192100," So depending on the chemistry,"
3192100,3195020," depending on the quality of that particular battery,"
3195020,3198380," if you use slow trickle charging versus fast charging,"
3198380,3202700," one or another could perform dramatically different."
3202700,3204020," Yeah."
3204020,3208100," There's so much, boy is there ever a lot to it."
3208100,3211020," Eternal Salt says like Pyrex"
3211020,3212820," when that Chinese mega company bought the note."
3212820,3214620," I actually didn't know that Pyrex got bought"
3214620,3217100," and I didn't, I don't know if the quality has gotten worse."
3217100,3218460," I heard that they got bought out."
3218460,3220260," I have no idea about the quality."
3220260,3221100," Interesting."
3221100,3223420," And old school stuff lasts forever."
3223420,3224700," Yeah, literally forever."
3224700,3226100," Yeah, I don't know."
3226100,3229180," There's some people saying beeswax seals would really well"
3229180,3231660," against like hand oils and stuff."
3231660,3232500," Oh, interesting."
3232500,3233460," Well, that's cool."
3233460,3236940," I'm sure the greater warehouse engineer team"
3236940,3239020," would figure out what the best option would be."
3239020,3242220," Too bad there are not gonna be any bees."
3242220,3243060," Yeah."
3243060,3244940," Yeah."
3244940,3245940," So that's sad."
3245940,3250220," Yeah."
3250220,3252220," From Benjamin, next question."
3252220,3253940," Hello, from Germany."
3253940,3256340," Do you think the escalation with China and Taiwan"
3256340,3258980," could crash the entire tech industry?"
3258980,3259820," Yes."
3259820,3260660," Sure could."
3260660,3264020," Like, immediately."
3264020,3265460," Overnight, sure good."
3265460,3270340," Because basically TSMC is by far,"
3270340,3273620," the largest player for chip fabrication,"
3273620,3275940," particularly advanced chips."
3275940,3280180," Samsung is a distant second, if I recall correctly."
3280180,3281500," Or is Intel still ahead of them?"
3281500,3284780," But then Intel, until they really ramp up"
3284780,3286900," their third party fabrication strategy"
3286900,3288100," is not really doing that."
3288100,3289260," As far as I know, they're mostly"
3289260,3292660," fabbing their own products as it stands right now."
3292660,3297660," And TSMC, it's right in the name, is in Taiwan."
3297660,3305140," So looking at the chip race that's going on right now,"
3305140,3306820," you look at the chips act in the US,"
3306820,3310700," you look at the way China has been fighting"
3310700,3314940," to get their hands on high-end lithography equipment."
3314940,3317780," I forget what that Chinese state-owned,"
3317780,3320100," basically chip fabber is."
3320100,3322580," I forget the name, but I think they're doing"
3322580,3324740," up to 14 nanometer right now."
3324740,3327340," And they're trying to get their hands on more advanced stuff."
3327340,3330900," Look at the way this technology arms race"
3330900,3332020," is ramping up right now."
3332020,3335060," Because it's so obvious that next generation weaponry,"
3335060,3339760," unless it is, AI powered, is gonna be utterly useless."
3339760,3346620," And the incentive that China has to just claim Taiwan"
3346620,3352900," is higher than ever."
3352900,3355180," You know, up until now, it seems like it's been"
3355180,3359700," mostly an emotional incentive to claim the island nation."
3359700,3360620," But--"
3360620,3361980," - That was a big industry."
3361980,3366980," - Yeah, but now with what a technological hub Taiwan is,"
3366980,3371620," I can only see it going up."
3371620,3375020," SMIC, that's the one."
3375020,3377180," Thank you, thank you, Flowplane Chat."
3377180,3379140," - They fired missiles over Taiwan,"
3379140,3380500," like a couple of days ago."
3380500,3381740," - Yeah, well, there was the whole thing"
3381740,3384220," with Nancy Pelosi visiting Taiwan,"
3384220,3388300," which I gotta say, not a huge fan, Nancy Pelosi,"
3388300,3389500," but Ballsy move."
3389500,3390620," - Yeah."
3390620,3392220," - I mean, respect for that."
3392220,3393060," - Yep."
3393060,3395780," - You know, maybe,"
3395780,3400260," it's a bit of a weird move given the, you know,"
3400260,3405380," profiting that her husband, technically, I guess,"
3405380,3410380," has done with like, through chip stocks"
3410380,3414340," and not definitely not insider trading."
3414340,3416540," You think they wouldn't want to disrupt the tech industry,"
3416540,3418820," but then, you know, who knows, maybe they're shorting it now."
3418820,3422900," I don't know. (laughs)"
3422900,3425660," - Inferno says nobody likes Nancy Pelosi to be frank."
3425660,3428740," I mean, yeah, yeah, that's fair."
3428740,3434780," - Moving on."
3434780,3436940," - We've got another question from Liam,"
3436940,3440500," wondering what your take is on the Hasbro selfie series"
3440500,3442700," where you use an app to take pictures of your face,"
3442700,3444740," then Hasbro sends out and has your face"
3444740,3447820," made into custom action figurehead."
3447820,3452820," - Ah, well Hasbro selfie series,"
3452820,3454460," is that, is that pulse?"
3454460,3455820," What's, oh, hold on."
3455820,3457620," I thought I, yeah, here we go."
3457620,3458820," I thought I searched for this."
3458820,3459820," What happened?"
3459820,3463180," Create your own custom action figure."
3463180,3464980," Choose your location."
3464980,3466020," - Not Canada."
3466020,3468380," - Okay, then, sure, I'm German today."
3468380,3470980," - Make room on your shelf."
3470980,3472140," - And it's English, of course."
3472140,3473100," - For yourself."
3473100,3474380," - Sure, I'll take your cookies."
3474380,3476460," - That's actually a really good tag, right?"
3476460,3477820," - New Rangers."
3477820,3479700," Look at this."
3479700,3484980," Okay, Boba Fett in disguise."
3484980,3486580," Sorry, how's my face on this?"
3486580,3488100," - I think you need to do the US"
3488100,3490500," 'cause the page change in Germany might not be available."
3490500,3491340," - Yeah, mine's work."
3491340,3492940," I clicked on US and mine's--"
3492940,3493780," - Well, I don't know."
3493780,3496780," That is definitely not the green and black ranger"
3496780,3500340," from the show that I watched, so this has gotta be it, right?"
3500340,3501540," - There's been a new show."
3501540,3503020," - What's the lightning, yeah, but no,"
3503020,3505780," these look like the retro uniforms though."
3505780,3507820," - This is definitely the retro Megazord."
3507820,3508900," - Should we show Luke's screen?"
3508900,3510900," - Yeah, I think you're totally off."
3510900,3512460," - I think you're totally off."
3512460,3514820," - So this is the Hasbro selfie series."
3514820,3516620," Not what you were just looking at."
3516620,3518500," This is the tagline that I liked a lot."
3518500,3520020," Make room on your shelf for yourself."
3520020,3521140," I think that's hilarious."
3521140,3522540," - Okay, that's pretty good."
3522540,3524460," - It's pretty classic."
3524460,3526180," - They have this thing, which is, I guess,"
3526180,3528980," trying to represent you getting scanned."
3528980,3529820," - Yeah."
3529820,3531820," - And then just a stay in the know thing."
3531820,3533180," Nothing really going on."
3533180,3537100," This one of a kind experience will be launching in fall 2022,"
3537100,3540260," exclusively on the Hasbro Pulse mobile app"
3540260,3543860," for fans aged 16 and older in the US only."
3543860,3545260," So that's, yeah, that's why it didn't show."
3545260,3547260," - All right, why did they even give me the option"
3547260,3548340," to go to Germany then?"
3548340,3549860," - Who knows?"
3549860,3552620," Sign up below for the inclusive selfie series mailing list."
3552620,3553580," Would you do it?"
3553580,3557420," Did you get an action figure of yourself?"
3557420,3559780," - I mean, I could see myself just being like,"
3559780,3560620," (sighs)"
3560620,3565340," then again, I don't know, hard to say."
3565340,3567300," I don't actually buy that much,"
3567300,3569860," well, kind of stuff."
3569860,3573100," I could definitely see a lot of people doing it though."
3573100,3574100," - Oh yeah."
3574100,3579100," - Like this is next level, like genius tier product management."
3579100,3582460," - I think if Hasbro really wants to pop off with this,"
3582460,3584420," they should let people merchandise them."
3584420,3588620," - Oh, like offer like a bulk rate."
3588620,3589460," You know what?"
3589460,3591220," - The way they're gonna be manufacturing these though,"
3591220,3594100," they're gonna be inherently like low volume."
3594100,3596900," I don't think it'll there'll even be much of a savings."
3596900,3599180," - Yeah, I don't know."
3599180,3602500," I just think there's creators out there"
3602500,3606380," that would wanna sell like an action figure of themselves."
3606380,3609020," - Hasn't Hasbro already done partnerships like that though?"
3609020,3610140," I think so."
3610140,3611140," - I don't know."
3611140,3615060," But if they, if maybe if they use this to like widen that."
3615060,3616900," - Okay, Flowplane Chat reminds me"
3616900,3620020," that I already have multiple 3D printed action figures"
3620020,3620860," of myself."
3620860,3621700," - Yes, but I don't think this is true."
3621700,3624140," - This is true, but I didn't buy them for me."
3624140,3625420," - Yeah, so that doesn't count."
3625420,3627820," - Oh, as a gift though, I could see myself"
3627820,3630260," buying someone an action figure of themselves."
3630260,3631740," Yeah, for sure."
3631740,3632580," - Okay."
3632580,3633500," - I thought you were gonna say as a gift,"
3633500,3636260," you could see yourself buying them an action figure of you"
3636260,3639340," and giving it to them and I was gonna be like, whoa."
3639340,3640460," - I could see him doing that."
3640460,3641300," I could definitely see that."
3641300,3642140," - Oh, come on."
3642140,3643660," (laughing)"
3643660,3644980," Come on."
3645860,3648100," It's like, dang, dude, okay."
3648100,3650860," - That's brutal."
3650860,3652060," (laughing)"
3652060,3653700," - No."
3653700,3654700," What do I think of it?"
3654700,3656220," I think they're geniuses."
3656220,3658900," I think as long as they can make the economics work,"
3658900,3661340," they're gonna sell so freaking many of these."
3661340,3662180," - Yeah, why not?"
3662180,3664460," - I assume they'll start with just faces"
3664460,3667220," and then from there, you'll actually be able to like,"
3667220,3668860," you know, design what you're,"
3668860,3671060," what you're wanna be wearing and all that kind of stuff."
3671060,3674300," - I guarantee you, you're gonna see some wedding cakes."
3674300,3675420," - Oh yeah."
3675420,3678980," - With action figures of the athletes on top,"
3678980,3682180," especially with the way that like Marvel's been popping off"
3682180,3684220," and stuff, the whole like superhero action figure thing"
3684220,3685860," is like totally 100%."
3685860,3686700," - Yep, 100%."
3686700,3689060," And the number of people that do like a Star Wars themed"
3689060,3691300," wedding, one that I saw recently,"
3691300,3696300," 'cause I was checking out covers of the romantic flight"
3696300,3699220," song from the soundtrack of \"How to Train Your Dragon.\""
3699220,3703620," There are some amazing, amazing covers of it."
3703620,3707220," Anyway, I saw someone walked, someone I had it as,"
3707220,3709540," they had a live orchestra at their wedding,"
3709540,3711580," playing \"How to Train Your Dragon\" music"
3711580,3713620," while they walked up to the altar."
3713620,3715340," - Oh, yeah, no kidding, right?"
3715340,3718300," But anyway, you know, with that in mind,"
3718300,3721380," how realistic would it be to have Astrid and Hiccup"
3721380,3725900," with the heads of the bride and groom on top of the cake?"
3725900,3728700," Obviously, by the time you hire an orchestra,"
3728700,3731260," you know, what's a custom figurine from Hasbro?"
3731260,3732780," - 99, 99, easy. - It could play to keep people"
3732780,3733780," forever, right?"
3733780,3735020," - Yeah, exactly."
3735020,3738620," Exactly, I could totally see people manufacturing,"
3738620,3740620," like landfill, like that."
3740620,3741460," It's good."
3741460,3744900," I read a really interesting article recently, actually."
3744900,3746460," I don't think I talked about the Samuyshoe."
3746460,3748740," I think I was talking to you about it at some point though,"
3748740,3751340," about how one of the big industries"
3751340,3754980," that is just popping off right now is junk removal."
3754980,3759980," Because millennials have like no space"
3760100,3763060," and baby boomers had nothing but space"
3763060,3767020," and a compulsive desire to acquire shit."
3767020,3771820," And so as they are downsizing or passing away,"
3771820,3777780," there's just this mountain, this veritable mountain"
3777780,3781860," of garbage that the next generation either doesn't want"
3781860,3784900," or has absolutely nowhere to put."
3784900,3788100," And this generation of people that are like,"
3788100,3792340," yeah, we accumulated this bone china."
3792340,3795300," And I'm sitting here, like I was in thrift store the other day"
3795300,3798060," picking up like cheap Archie comics for my kids."
3798060,3801060," And I was like, I was looking at all the like"
3801060,3803260," the fine China gold leaf stuff."
3803260,3806020," I'm like, who the fuck do you want any of this?"
3806020,3810020," Are you for real?"
3810020,3812220," This is worth nothing now, right?"
3812220,3814580," And this is like a prized possession"
3814580,3818060," for silent generation or for your baby boomers out"
3818060,3821380," there. Oh, we won't eat on this because it's like the nice."
3821380,3824340," It sits in the cupboard and never gets taken out"
3824340,3825420," until no one wants it."
3825420,3827700," Now give me some Mel Mac, is it called?"
3827700,3831100," Is that what that like super cheap?"
3831100,3834260," Yeah, Mel Mac."
3834260,3838180," Yeah, Melamine from American cyan amid here."
3838180,3839020," Let's let's check."
3839020,3841100," You know, I've talked about fast fashion before."
3841100,3841940," Yeah, here we go."
3841940,3843460," My girlfriend told me about this website."
3843460,3844580," Give me some Mel Mac."
3844580,3846460," This is my childhood right here, boys."
3846460,3849020," Yeah, definitely."
3849020,3850260," Okay."
3850260,3851660," My girlfriend told me about this website."
3851660,3853660," I'm probably going to pronounce it incorrectly, but she."
3853660,3858420," She in shine, she in bell recognized it."
3858420,3862060," Yeah, I think it's she in she in there's like eight dollar shirts."
3862060,3865260," Pants for six bucks."
3865260,3866260," Oh, yes."
3866260,3871100," There's no way these things last beyond like a season."
3871100,3873700," 100% and like, I don't know."
3873700,3874900," Yeah, it is super cheap."
3874900,3876260," It is super cheap."
3876260,3877700," It definitely has that going for it."
3877700,3880460," And they like look relatively trendy and stuff."
3880460,3881460," Yeah, fast fashion."
3881460,3883940," Like environmental disaster."
3883940,3885420," Oh, yeah, actually."
3885420,3886740," There's this whole thing."
3886740,3891980," How like the donated clothes, they have too much of it."
3891980,3895460," Yeah, there's just like there's just like mountains of donated clothes."
3895460,3897260," I don't have anyone to give it to you."
3897260,3899540," Like, okay."
3899540,3902420," Brutal."
3902420,3904940," And there's got to be stuff that you can just like make out of it."
3904940,3906740," Like just shred it and like make stuff."
3906740,3909620," You know, like it can't be that hard, can it?"
3909620,3914460," I think you'd have a lot of inconsistency and like fabric quality and stuff like that."
3914460,3915100," Yeah."
3915100,3917860," Getting back down to like string is going to be basically impossible."
3917860,3918660," Well, no, you wouldn't be."
3918660,3920740," Oh, no, you wouldn't be to get back down to string."
3920740,3925900," You would just like, like, I, okay, like for example, that insulation that we have"
3925900,3930500," that's made out of recycled blue jeans where they just spread jeans and then just"
3930500,3934020," like turn it into like blue jean cake that you stuff in your walls like it."
3935020,3937500," I mean, that's pretty much what it is."
3937500,3940940," Yeah, I don't know."
3940940,3944460," I think I think in like shirts and stuff, it's going to be more inconsistent though."
3944460,3946780," Yeah, I don't think you wouldn't be able to make shirts."
3946780,3948700," Oh, oh, you mean just like the materials in them."
3948700,3950100," I mean, I don't know."
3950100,3950860," Here's a question."
3950860,3957420," If it cost half as much and there was a chance that from one bat to the next,"
3957420,3961540," the performance was going to be plus or minus, you know, never mind 5% like we were"
3961540,3962540," talking about for batteries."
3962740,3964380," I'm talking 25%."
3964380,3967020," Would you just, would you buy?"
3967020,3971940," Would you buy fabric fabric insulation that's just like ask?"
3971940,3972540," Some shirts."
3972540,3973660," Yeah, it's like, I don't know."
3973660,3975420," It's made of shirts or some skirts in there."
3975420,3976580," Few buttons."
3976580,3980980," Oh, man, maybe you got to find something to do with it."
3980980,3985580," Um, yeah, use clothing ends up in in landfills."
3985580,3985900," Yeah."
3985900,3987540," Yeah, pretty much."
3987540,3988020," It's bad."
3990100,3991660," Question here from Luke."
3991660,3994420," Hi, Linus, I do cell phone repair."
3994420,3996380," That's not really a question."
3996380,3997820," Yeah."
3997820,3998380," Yeah."
3998380,3998940," Yeah."
3998940,3999460," Got him."
3999460,4000380," What's going on, Luke?"
4000380,4001260," Classic Luke."
4001260,4005180," But I was also curious if when labs is up and running fully, there'll be any"
4005180,4008260," testing of durability of mobile devices or tear downs."
4008260,4009260," Like I fix it does."
4009260,4013420," I don't think that we are going to get into either of those."
4013420,4017660," Um, durability testing is not useful on a sample size of one."
4017660,4020500," And quite frankly, it's not even useful on a sample size of 10."
4020500,4026660," We showed back when we toured one plus's manufacturing facility that what it"
4026660,4031300," takes is specialized equipment, whether it's for drops or whether it's for"
4031300,4035500," tumbles that is run on many, many devices."
4035500,4039940," And they have the luxury of many, many disposable devices to chuck into these"
4039940,4041940," things that are not finished quality, right?"
4041940,4044740," That might have engineering sample grade."
4044740,4047180," So season them, for example, like they literally"
4047180,4049140," actually want to test is ready to test."
4049140,4049860," Exactly."
4049860,4055020," Or they could make dummy ones that have exactly the same body and they can"
4055020,4059260," investigate it for screen cracking without actually wasting hundreds and"
4059260,4061500," hundreds of dollars worth of internal hardware on them."
4061500,4066060," Uh, we, we just don't, we don't have that kind of a luxury."
4066060,4068020," And that's the kind of thing that, you know what?"
4068020,4074220," Hey, three to five years from now, if the community said we want this, we"
4074220,4075900," might even create a system."
4076020,4077500," Actually, this is a really good idea."
4077500,4082620," We should write this down, but we could create a system where our community could,"
4082620,4086700," could fund, could specifically fund specific tests."
4086700,4092660," They could say, Hey, uh, we want to see, we want to see 10 iPhones in a tumble"
4092660,4098380," dryer. Um, and then we would basically build a mechanism where they could, we"
4098380,4101580," could say like, look, we're not going to, we're not paying out a pocket for that."
4101580,4105980," There is, there is no way that we could make up that 10."
4105980,4112420," $10,000 worth of iPhones on this video or this article or just this data sheet,"
4112420,4113380," right? It's not happening."
4113380,4117180," But if you guys really want to see it, then sure."
4117180,4118180," Yeah, we're into it."
4118180,4121980," Uh, we could even see manufacturers potentially funding something like that."
4121980,4126540," Like if you're a, um, no, I don't know, that'd be tough."
4126540,4127340," That'd be tough."
4127340,4131100," Like if I'm an otterbox and I just said, Hey, I want independent third party"
4131100,4134340," testing of how well the iPhone holds up to this thing."
4134820,4139700," There's no way that they're going to just write the check and walk away, uh,"
4139700,4143500," and not expect us to also test otterboxes, for example."
4143500,4146820," So that's, yeah, that's tough."
4146820,4149180," Is that an acceptable thing?"
4149180,4153460," As long as they don't interfere with our data and they understand, as long as,"
4153460,4156980," as part of our agreement, we basically say, yeah, you got to understand that once"
4156980,4159700," you write the check, we're publishing the data regardless of the outcome."
4159700,4162540," I don't think it's bad to test otterboxes."
4162540,4166780," I could see us doing it for LTT, but I don't think that's something that the lab"
4166780,4168140," would just do and publish the data."
4168140,4171100," So that's something where LTT could use the lab."
4171100,4171700," Yeah."
4171700,4173740," I, that's where I would kind of draw the line there."
4173740,4174940," That seems fair."
4174940,4175860," Yeah."
4175860,4179380," Question here from William."
4179380,4180460," High Linus."
4180460,4183100," And one of your, sorry, no, I'll get to that one sec."
4183100,4185220," As for I fix it, I think they do a great job."
4185220,4188460," I don't think we'd be contributing anything to that particular space at this time."
4188460,4190620," Low priority."
4190620,4191500," We love I fix it."
4192180,4194380," From William, I line us in one of your at home videos."
4194380,4196260," I saw Azuma plush in your kids' playroom."
4196260,4198740," Azuma, your favorite Paw Patrol pup."
4198740,4200220," Or do you prefer a different one?"
4200220,4206700," I can't say that I have a favorite pup, but I can definitely recite the, the intro"
4206700,4208700," theme song from my kids watch."
4208700,4210940," Thankfully, they're over Paw Patrol at this point."
4210940,4215660," They're, they don't really watch much TV lately, actually."
4215660,4218980," Now that I think about it, they'll watch wild crafts if they're, if they're just"
4218980,4220780," like down to ever even heard of that."
4220780,4221660," Never heard of wild crafts."
4221660,4222660," Paw Patrol."
4222660,4223380," The craft brothers."
4223380,4223660," Yeah."
4223660,4224460," Like Zaboomafu."
4224460,4226220," Oh, okay."
4226220,4227060," That was a boom."
4227060,4227460," A few."
4227460,4227900," Sure."
4227900,4228380," Okay."
4228380,4230740," I don't know what the heck Zaboomafu is, but."
4230740,4231500," Oh, wow."
4231500,4232860," Zaboomafu legit, dude."
4232860,4233620," Okay."
4233620,4234660," You don't know the good stuff."
4234660,4242220," Well, this question's from Ryan, but we've had a couple of people ask if we had any"
4242220,4245900," information about what the backpack warranty will be now that we've started getting"
4245900,4246380," ready to ship out."
4246380,4247900," It's a wonderful question."
4248100,4254140," Right now we are, we're holding firm with, we are not formalizing anything, but we"
4254140,4255580," will stand behind our products."
4255580,4259700," Um, I think that we have a pretty good."
4259700,4264740," I think we have a pretty good track record for just kind of dealing with it."
4264740,4273380," The last thing that I would want to do is create some kind of like legal liability."
4273380,4278060," Um, for, you know, like, I don't, I don't know what the future holds."
4278220,4278580," Right."
4278580,4287260," Like I could die tomorrow and let's say, let's say my, you know, my, my, my muse, my, my, my flame,"
4287260,4290940," uh, Yvonne is like, I can't do this."
4290940,4296940," Like I can't walk in every day and, you know, see, line us all over the place."
4296940,4298580," And she's just like, yeah, I can't."
4298580,4299100," Right."
4299100,4301020," That, that's, that's possible."
4301020,4301780," And I respect that."
4301780,4307060," Um, so the last thing I want to do is create some kind of, of legal obligation"
4307340,4312380," because of some kinds of tea, some kind of teas and sees that we have created"
4312380,4315860," around our, uh, our, our warranty policy, for example."
4315860,4319300," And like, yeah, I guess that does put you guys in a bit of an uncomfortable"
4319300,4322700," position, but it's not our intention to go away."
4322700,4329140," It's not our intention to do anything about our current policy of just dealing"
4329140,4334820," with it, but, um, it's not our primary business making backpacks."
4335300,4340900," And so the last thing I would want to do is hang this albatross around my family's"
4340900,4345100," neck, um, when they're already have other stuff to deal with."
4345100,4348900," So that's where that's where we're at on that."
4348900,4352940," Question here from Chester."
4352940,4358060," Any suggestions for ethernet cable routing along the inside of brick walls."
4358060,4363940," I mean, other than just running it along the mortar and then using like those,"
4363980,4367860," um, using just, uh, like plastic drywall anchors, you kind of drill them out."
4367860,4370780," You put in the anchors, you screwed into the expanse."
4370780,4372020," They, so they grab on."
4372020,4373620," I mean, I don't know what else to tell you."
4373620,4377380," If the brick wall is painted, you can paint the cable to match."
4377380,4380540," Um, it's just always going to look pretty bad."
4380540,4380820," Yeah."
4380820,4384500," Painting into match never fully solves that problem."
4384500,4387660," You briefly mentioned it in the pre show."
4387660,4390420," And so we got a few people asking if there are any new house updates."
4392260,4394020," Actually, we shot to today."
4394020,4396860," We say you were, I heard you're at home."
4396860,4397260," Yeah."
4397260,4400020," I, I did away with my 48 inch monitor."
4400020,4401820," 48 inches."
4401820,4402780," It's pretty big."
4402780,4405460," It's, it maybe is too big."
4405460,4410860," So, uh, I tried a couple different options."
4410860,4414820," The alien wear 34 inch ultra wide with the cutio lead screen."
4414820,4422140," But then LG also has the C2 42 inch, which also looks."
4422580,4423420," Almost is good."
4423420,4427940," Oh, and is bigger, bigger, but not as big as 48 inches."
4427940,4430140," So that one's going to be pretty good."
4430140,4434460," I also, uh, in that video, we update, you know, how I changed my microphone."
4434460,4435020," Yeah."
4435020,4437500," So I do that in that video."
4437500,4437860," Got it."
4437860,4438940," Um, what else?"
4438940,4439700," What else did we do?"
4439700,4445020," Oh, and then we also shot one that's about sort of fun, novel, interesting,"
4445020,4446180," charging solutions."
4446180,4451700," It doesn't sound very interesting, but I will tell you that within the first 10"
4451700,4453620," seconds of the video, you're going to be hooked."
4453620,4454220," Okay."
4454220,4460460," Because I managed to rip a car charger out of the ceiling of my house."
4460460,4464340," And I can't promise that there won't be other shenanigans."
4464340,4465780," We're actually not done shooting that one yet."
4465780,4467260," So I don't know what else will happen."
4467260,4467660," Okay."
4467660,4470260," We should, um, we should probably hit the sponsors."
4470260,4472420," Oh, do we have sponsors?"
4472420,4474460," Are there sponsors for the show?"
4474460,4475460," No, maybe not."
4475460,4479020," Uh, well, I think you, I think you called them at the beginning."
4479020,4480580," I don't even have the right dock open."
4480580,4482180," So I guess you're doing the first one."
4482180,4486540," Thanks to short form, our newest sponsor for sponsoring this week's show."

4620660,4622740," Are you looking for a new laptop for next semester?"
4622740,4623700," Well, they've got those."
4623900,4629140," Or what about a desktop PC that's totally for school and definitely not for gaming?"
4629140,4631820," Mom, I swear, well, they got you covered there too."
4631820,4634900," And if you're into building your own PC, they've got components on sale, like"

4650140,4652940," prizes at the link down below."
4653380,4658140," Uh, Satir in Flowplane Chat, if you sent in three support tickets and didn't get a"
4658140,4663980," reply, uh, the problem, I don't, I can't possibly understand how that happened,"
4663980,4667660," but they reply to every ticket that they receive."
4667660,4674380," So what you might have to do is, um, you can try tweeting, uh, at Nick and then"
4674380,4677780," maybe just say like, Hey, here's my order number or my ticket number, ideally."
4677780,4679540," And then they can go track it down."
4679540,4680540," Nothing is perfect."
4680780,4684660," But if you're, if you're not getting a reply from support eventually, sometimes"
4684660,4687620," we do get behind, then something is wrong."
4687620,4689460," That's not how that works."
4689460,4693420," All right."
4693420,4695420," What else we got to talk about today?"
4695420,4698700," Should we talk about the, uh, hills behind the counter?"
4698700,4699940," Do we save that for another time?"
4699940,4701580," Uh, we can save that for another time."
4701580,4703660," I want to talk about Amazon buying iRobot."
4703660,4703980," Okay."
4703980,4704220," Yeah."
4704220,4706340," You have strong opinions about this."
4706340,4709300," Uh, my reaction to it was just like, Oh, okay."
4709380,4713460," They just moved closer to being an entire country, but yeah, what's, what's, uh,"
4713460,4714180," what's up with yours?"
4714180,4718860," Amazon has signed an agreement to purchase iRobot maker of the Roomba for"
4718860,4722460," 1.7 billion dollars."
4722460,4724260," Almost as much as Twitter loses every year."
4724260,4727540," In specific money talk, it is an all cash transaction."
4727540,4728220," Wow."
4728220,4730460," For $61 a share."
4730460,4731220," No, that's a big deal."
4731220,4731940," That's a big deal."
4731940,4732460," No, I know."
4732460,4733060," That's why."
4733060,4733300," Yeah."
4733300,4738820," Earlier this year, iRobot launched its latest iRobot OS and AI platform for its"
4738820,4739940," vacuums and mops."
4739940,4744980," iRobot OS was designed to separate Roomba from the rest of the vacuums out there."
4744980,4749500," Amazon has not detailed plans for what it intends to do with iRobot."
4749500,4754380," Um, and the big A actually launched their own smart home robot last year called"
4754380,4756460," Astro for a thousand dollars."
4756460,4760980," Uh, it could map out floor plans, listen for commands and recognize faces."
4760980,4762580," It could not clean."
4762580,4767380," So here is kind of on the surface."
4767380,4768460," You can kind of go, okay."
4768780,4772500," Amazon is buying competent cleaning technology."
4772500,4774060," So that's one thing."
4774060,4776220," But hear me out."
4776220,4780420," What I think is Amazon just wants yet another camera in your house."
4780420,4785580," Matt, oh, they're also mapping your house yet another sensor array that patrols your"
4785580,4791420," house and monitors what the heck it is that you're doing and where you're going."
4791420,4794700," Recognize your face and vacuum definitely needs to do that."
4794700,4796260," What you like to spend your time on."
4796260,4796660," Yeah."
4796980,4799260," This is beautiful."
4799260,4800020," Don't buy it."
4800020,4803220," Please, I mean, you can buy it."
4803220,4807300," No, but like just know what you're getting yourself into."
4807300,4808260," That's all I ask."
4808260,4809380," That's all I ask."
4809380,4815500," I asked that you don't buy it between ring, Roomba, Astro and Echo."
4815500,4824740," Amazon will now be able to basically not basically literally follow you around"
4825380,4830980," and know exactly who you're talking to about what and what you're doing."
4830980,4833460," Anytime you are at home."
4833460,4835820," Isn't that wild?"
4835820,4837340," Super cool."
4837340,4842340," Very cool."
4842340,4844220," Yeah, that was it."
4844220,4844740," That was it."
4844740,4849820," I just wanted to kind of laugh at how Amazon is basically the buy and"
4849820,4850820," large from Wally."
4850820,4851380," Yeah."
4851380,4854980," At this point, stop bending over and giving Amazon so much money, please."
4854980,4855740," Thank you."
4855740,4859620," People complain about like all these working conditions and stuff and they're like,"
4859620,4862260," still can't drive to the store."
4862260,4864100," Still going to buy everything off Amazon."
4864100,4865100," Yeah."
4865100,4867460," And then I'll go protest Amazon at the same time."
4867460,4872420," Yes, as supporting them financially as hard as I possibly can at all points in time."
4872420,4873660," I have a prime membership."
4873660,4874660," Come on, guys."
4874660,4875140," I know."
4875140,4876180," I know."
4876180,4879580," But it's so convenient for business."
4879580,4880660," Oh my goodness."
4883580,4885140," I've talked about this too much on Wayne show."
4885140,4887140," People don't like my spicy Amazon takes."
4887140,4887860," It's fine."
4887860,4888780," I get it, guys."
4888780,4889860," Just keep supporting them."
4889860,4892860," Eventually they'll own your house and your car and you, but that's OK."
4892860,4893660," That's fine."
4893660,4897300," No, no, test level on your car by the vacuum so that they can track your face."
4897300,4898940," Because that's definitely required."
4898940,4899940," That makes a lot of sense."
4899940,4900700," Cool."
4900700,4906860," Anyways, your opinions, Matt."
4906860,4909780," Oh, we got a tackle at some point."
4909780,4910300," Yeah."
4910300,4910820," OK."
4911340,4916260," A lot of folks in Europe are mad about the LTT backpack price."
4916260,4917700," Amazon has free shipping."
4917700,4920420," Why does an LTT store?"
4920420,4921500," OK, well, hold on."
4921500,4921900," Hold on."
4921900,4923340," Don't don't be condescending."
4923340,4925420," A lot of people don't necessarily OK."
4925420,4928500," I know I was just trying to tie in the Amazon."
4928500,4930180," Thank you for one thing."
4930180,4934980," When we assess tax in the checkout, that's the one time that tax should be assessed."
4934980,4936540," That's not Canadian tax."
4936540,4939060," And then you pay your own country's tax after."
4939300,4943860," If you're getting assessed tax again, when the package arrives, you need to take that up"
4943860,4946300," with the last mile courier because they are doing it wrong."
4946300,4948780," You already paid the tax to be clear."
4948780,4953780," I don't think the way that we communicate it is the same way that it is normally"
4953780,4954540," communicated."
4954540,4957620," I'm not necessarily saying that we're communicating it poorly or that we're not"
4957620,4960820," communicating it, but I think it is abnormal."
4960820,4964020," So when I think when people see it, they're assuming that it is different."
4964020,4964620," OK."
4964940,4970580," For another thing, so thing number two, the expensive shipping we have, I believe it"
4970580,4977700," is capped at either 50 or $60 on average, looking at our order history and the quotes"
4977700,4980060," that we got across many couriers."
4980060,4982340," We really did work hard at this."
4982340,4992420," Already our average costs and our average amount that we're charging are"
4992420,4994180," subsidized or sorry."
4994220,4997460," Already the costs are higher than what we're actually charging."
4997460,5003500," We are subsidizing backpack shipping to, I believe, everywhere but Canada and the US"
5003500,5007780," who are helping us subsidize the other regions, but nominally."
5007780,5015100," So yeah, I think we're eating somewhere in the neighborhood of $10 to $20 on pretty"
5015100,5017820," much everything outside of North America per shipment."
5017820,5022700," There just is not more that I can do at that point."
5022980,5026220," So my shopping chat said my shipping was $89."
5026220,5027340," So there is no cap."
5027340,5029540," You probably had other things in your order."
5029540,5030020," More stuff."
5030020,5033660," So that was a judgment call that we made on backpack, knowing that it wasn't going"
5033660,5039660," to be in stock for, I believe, Wave One ships out September 20th by September 20th."
5039660,5045220," So we made a judgment call because either we were going to have to hold people's"
5045220,5047820," entire order until their backpack was ready."
5048300,5053660," And if we did that, we would be able to charge one shipping fee or we were going"
5053660,5058380," to ship out everything else on your order and then the backpack separately, which"
5058380,5062740," meant that, well, because we were paying for the shipping twice, we have to charge"
5062740,5063580," the shipping twice."
5063580,5068260," And there wasn't a way with our limited internal systems right now to have that"
5068260,5070620," be a toggle option that people could choose."
5070620,5076780," So we made the call because we know no matter how many times we say it, no matter"
5076780,5082020," how clearly we say it, there are always a very significant number of people who"
5082020,5086380," get confused and frustrated when they order something, even though they know"
5086380,5090420," one of the items is going to be delayed, whether it's a custom printed shirt or"
5090420,5091260," something like that."
5091260,5095260," There are always people who get confused and angry and message customer service"
5095260,5099620," and create a ton of work because they haven't received the other items from their"
5099620,5100220," order yet."
5100220,5104460," And so we made the call to ship out everything we have and follow up with the"
5104460,5105420," backpacks later."
5105500,5109380," So for the backpack itself, there was a completely separate shipping fee assessed."
5109380,5116780," If there is a legitimate problem and you legitimately did encounter something"
5116780,5120020," else, then please do message support."
5120020,5127860," Oh, yeah, there was also the sticker, the sticker controversy."
5127860,5133220," If you ordered a backpack and just free stickers, you got charged shipping for"
5133220,5133780," the stickers."
5133780,5134740," We are dealing with that."
5134820,5136300," Yeah, it's being refunded."
5136300,5136740," It's being refunded."
5136740,5139220," It's been fixed, so it shouldn't happen anymore."
5139220,5142460," And it's being refunded, so we're taking care of it across the board."
5142460,5147100," What I don't fully remember, and I think some of the people might be might be"
5147100,5147460," interested."
5147460,5150900," What are the complications about setting up distribution from Europe?"
5150900,5153180," Do you have to like tax the company there?"
5153180,5153540," Yeah."
5153540,5154220," Yeah."
5154220,5156180," So that's that's a lot."
5156180,5158020," That's like it's not trivial."
5158020,5158580," Yeah."
5158580,5164740," And so aside from aside from just the cost of running a physical"
5164740,5170100," location there, the logistical nightmare of splitting our inventory, there is also"
5170100,5178460," the the taxation and reporting obligations that come with being now an EU company."
5178460,5180300," Where all of a sudden a multinational."
5180300,5185060," Do you think it's a coincidence that one plus started out as having one"
5185060,5190940," location web only from which they shipped all phones that charged $300 for a"
5190940,5196660," phone to becoming a multinational that has support and service centers in"
5196660,5201460," multiple countries that charges $600, $800 for a phone."
5201460,5203980," It's not it's not there's no free lunch."
5203980,5205460," You have to pay for it somewhere."
5205460,5205980," Yeah."
5205980,5207780," Uh, Aidan."
5207780,5208620," Yeah, go for it."
5208620,5215460," But then I'd rather wait."
5215460,5218300," I don't want to pay two X shipping."
5218300,5220020," I literally don't know what that means."
5220060,5222380," No, they would prefer to have a single shipment."
5222380,5224860," Oh, yeah, I get it."
5224860,5226300," Um,"
5226300,5231420," Unfortunately, we didn't have a way to do it either way."
5231420,5235540," So we're we're working on, I mean, we're constantly doing development on our,"
5235540,5236620," on our Shopify store."
5236620,5239500," It just takes time."
5239500,5240900," It just takes time."
5240900,5245900," And we fortunately, thanks to the amazing support that we've gotten from you"
5245900,5251620," guys on backpack, we have some money that we are spending, we are actively"
5251620,5252860," spending on hiring developers."
5252860,5254260," I mean, how are you hiring right now?"
5254260,5256220," Okay."
5256220,5257100," Thank you for that."
5257100,5262620," Um, no more for the store, but, um, a huge amount of the effort that's gone"
5262620,5266420," into store development for a while, the person who does that is in"
5266420,5269100," float plane chat right now, I think I saw them in here recently."
5269100,5275460," Um, a lot of that effort has gone to a big redesign that we wanted to happen"
5275460,5279260," because we wanted to freshen up the site, but also because we need to move"
5279260,5280700," onto a new theme."
5280700,5285020," Um, just because of like, I mean, we don't like own the platform and things are"
5285020,5287820," changing and we're moving to the Don theme."
5287820,5291660," Um, and that's really good for like a wide range of reasons."
5291660,5296020," Once we are on the Don theme, then we'll start being able to get back to features"
5296020,5301100," and stuff specifically for the store, but there's been a, a very big effort to"
5301100,5303180," get us, um, to the new version."
5303180,5303700," Yeah."
5303860,5308180," Aria Lux in Twitch chat asks, have you ever looked into variable pricing based"
5308180,5308820," on location?"
5308820,5312060," It might ease shipping costs if it appears not too exorbitant."
5312060,5314940," The problem with that is that."
5314940,5320740," It will for the people who live in areas that are very well serviced by"
5320740,5326100," couriers or by their, their local postal service, um, it will be a savings."
5326100,5326540," Yep."
5326540,5327220," You're right."
5327220,5332560," Unfortunately, what it will do is it will basically put ordering from LTT"
5332560,5335800," store completely out of reach for people in rural areas."
5335800,5340540," It generates, it's, it's just like the situation we're running into now where"
5340540,5344460," the people who are fine with the shipping costs will be fine and they'll be quiet."
5344460,5349380," And the people who are upset because they are at the high end of the shipping"
5349380,5354460," costs will be absolutely outraged and will bring that outrage online and into"
5354460,5356000," our customer support inbox."
5356000,5362380," And so what are we, what are we supposed to like there's, there's a, there's a trade off."
5362660,5363860," No matter which way we do it."
5363860,5364060," Yeah."
5364060,5368700," And in a, in a perfect world, I would say, yeah, sure, that makes total sense that"
5368700,5373460," people should just pay exactly the amount that the shipping cost, maybe with a slight"
5373460,5376520," surcharge so that we have a slush fund for running shipping promos or whatever"
5376520,5376720," else."
5376720,5376900," Yeah."
5376900,5378460," I'd say something like that makes a ton of sense."
5378460,5386640," But unfortunately in the real world, we can't charge, you know, $19 for shipping"
5386640,5391420," to Vancouver and $362 for shipping to a Caluit."
5392340,5393180," It's sorry."
5393180,5398060," We, we, we can't, we can't give the middle finger to that customer in a remote"
5398060,5403060," region that hard, even though that's how much it costs."
5403060,5407180," I don't know that that exact amount is right, but it is not inconceivable within"
5407180,5411420," Canada alone for shipping charges on a product like the backpack to exceed a"
5411420,5413820," hundred Canadian dollars easily."
5413820,5418260," So yeah, if you're somewhere where typically you're accustomed to it being"
5418260,5420620," cheaper, you're probably subsidizing someone else."
5420620,5423860," Well, we've said that forever to be fair."
5423860,5425940," That is not a, it's not new information."
5425940,5429060," Shipping is really expensive."
5429060,5432780," I'm a flanker says one additional warehouse would cover all of Europe and"
5432780,5433820," slash shipping times."
5433820,5435020," I know, but you're not listening."
5435020,5438900," What it wouldn't do is decrease our overall overhead."
5438900,5441140," Our costs would go up."
5441140,5444140," Our prices would just go up."
5444140,5450140," Once we have a physical location in a region, it gets really complicated."
5450140,5454700," Like we will need a team of people to manage it right now."
5454700,5457580," The entire creator warehouse teams, like 10 people."
5457580,5458980," So what?"
5458980,5460860," We're going to go hire another team."
5460860,5462340," Well, you're going to pay for it."
5462340,5464100," Right."
5464100,5465660," So I don't know."
5465660,5466260," It's tough."
5466260,5466980," It's tough."
5466980,5469620," I, there, there's no perfect answer."
5469620,5470820," We would love to do it."
5470820,5475740," What I had wanted to do way back in the day was, um, especially back when Hong"
5475740,5479540," Kong was so heavily subsidizing international shipping."
5479780,5483980," Like you could get a package shipped from Hong Kong for like a dollar."
5483980,5484780," You could buy stuff."
5484780,5489780," Yeah, you could buy stuff on like Ali Express or whatever for like $3 with free"
5489780,5494060," shipping and you're sitting here going, how does this make any sense whatsoever?"
5494060,5495740," Well, it's all state subsidies, right?"
5495740,5500100," Um, so what I had wanted to do was find a region like that where there's heavy"
5500100,5503180," state subsidies and international shipping and just take advantage of that."
5503180,5507340," But to my knowledge, nobody is really doing that to the same degree anymore."
5508980,5509220," Yeah."
5509220,5512580," And shipping in Canada in general is quite brutal."
5512580,5513420," Yeah."
5513420,5515460," Yeah."
5515460,5522140," Canada, uh, yeah, even just shipping something like, like you actually mentioned"
5522140,5526220," just a minute ago, shipping something inside Canada, not even leaving the borders"
5526220,5528180," can be like astronomically."
5528180,5531380," Oh, shipping something from my house to your house would cost me like 20 bucks."
5531380,5531740," Exactly."
5531740,5535140," I was just going to say, even if you're not going to a quality or whatever, like"
5535140,5540220," if you're going, if you're going basically down the street, it can still be really"
5540220,5540740," expensive."
5540740,5551620," Um, and I mean, the, the reality of it is that the backpack launch was a smash"
5551620,5552420," success."
5552420,5556020," So, you know, did we get it perfect?"
5556020,5559620," Maybe not, but we did get it pretty good."
5559620,5564580," And if, if huge shipping costs are a concern for you, but you, you know, you"
5564580,5567460," want to support the channel or whatever else, we do have things that don't weigh"
5567460,5569700," as much screwdriver is coming really soon."
5569700,5572700," It's a lower cost item and it's a much smaller item."
5572700,5577740," Um, if you're, if you're frustrated with how much backpack cost to ship, um, what"
5577740,5580780," something that I would recommend that you do, if you want to understand it a"
5580780,5583780," little better, at least is look into the concept of dimensional weight."
5583780,5590340," The backpack itself is not that heavy, but in shipping because their costs are"
5590340,5593980," less to do with the actual weight, unless it's air freight, in which case, weight"
5593980,5598260," matters a lot, but less to do with the actual weight, but more to do with the"
5598260,5599100," dimensions of it."
5599100,5604540," Backpack is huge and it takes up a lot of space on a pallet and every time a"
5604540,5607700," pallet gets moved, there's a cost."
5607700,5610900," So the farther it goes, the more it costs."
5610900,5615980," And the more of the pallet takes up, the more of the overall cost of moving those"
5615980,5618940," goods around has to be born by that one package."
5618940,5620780," And this, this is some assumptions, but."
5622780,5624460," Why I'm assuming, I'm assuming they're correct."
5624460,5624980," I don't know."
5624980,5625780," Maybe you can correct me."
5625780,5629860," Cause I know in the boxes for the backpacks, the backpacks themselves are"
5629860,5630980," filled with airbags."
5630980,5631460," They are."
5631460,5636100," Um, that's how they keep their shape because the reprieve fabric is really like"
5636100,5637380," strong, right?"
5637380,5641860," And we want it to be in, in good quality and with the proper shape and holding"
5641860,5642220," its form."
5642220,5648020," So if it gets crushed, like really badly, like sits crushed, crumpled, you, uh, you"
5648020,5651420," know, it gets delayed in shipping and it sits in a warehouse for six weeks under"
5651420,5652980," a giant pile of other stuff."
5652980,5655740," Uh, it could have a hard time bouncing back."
5655740,5658380," It is meant to, it is meant to retain."
5658380,5658700," Yeah."
5658700,5663580," Cause there's a lot of other like purses or backpacks or small bags or whatever"
5663580,5667740," that will come flat, but they're like, like tent material."
5667740,5668180," Yes."
5668180,5669820," It's, it's very different."
5669820,5670820," So it's not made for that."
5670820,5671100," Yeah."
5671100,5672460," Yep."
5672460,5673180," That's correct."
5673180,5680220," Have you, this is another thing."
5680220,5681420," I think you're just reading comments."
5681420,5682460," So I'm just going to keep riffing."
5682460,5682740," Sure."
5682740,5688540," Uh, this is, this is another thing that I, uh, had thought of recently is we talk"
5688540,5689980," about this with graphis cards."
5689980,5691660," So you released the halo product first."
5691660,5696620," Have you considered releasing a like, LTT backpack light?"
5696620,5699180," Um, I, I hadn't."
5699180,5704060," Uh, I mean, the backpack was built to be the one that I want, which that's what I"
5704060,5704300," want."
5704300,5708020," I carry a lot of stuff around and I, I like that."
5708660,5715820," Whether I, well, whether I like it or not, that's my life, but I have seen so many"
5715820,5719740," requests for it that I feel like we'd be morons to not at least explore it."
5719740,5722140," I can't guarantee anything right now."
5722140,5726500," It's absolutely not something that we have in development at the moment, but we"
5726500,5731300," had had people ask about it internally and we have had so many people ask about"
5731300,5736020," it from our audience that we'd be, yeah, there's just, there's just no way we won't"
5736020,5736860," at least explore it."
5736860,5737380," Cool."
5737380,5738020," Interesting."
5738020,5738340," Yeah."
5738340,5740540," All right."
5740540,5741500," Want to give us another one, Bill?"
5741500,5743260," Sure do."
5743260,5744220," How about a softball?"
5744220,5746900," Yes."
5746900,5748220," I'm a different one then."
5748220,5751700," Just kidding."
5751700,5754300," This question is from a whale from the land event."
5754300,5755300," Oh, hi."
5755300,5759180," The event was super fun and I hope we get to focus more on lands and LTX in the future."
5759180,5759940," That's not a question."
5759940,5763260," Luckily they followed up with a question."
5763260,5766340," I wanted to ask one thing about head protesting at the lab."
5766340,5766980," Oh, sure."
5766980,5770740," Do you have any plans to do frequency response at different volumes versus an equal"
5770740,5771540," loudness curve?"
5771540,5774620," It's something I've always wondered about frequency response graphs."
5774620,5776460," Interesting."
5776460,5779380," Um, I don't know."
5779380,5782620," That is a tremendous, wonderful question."
5782620,5787420," I don't know that I'll be able to get you an answer back in a, in a convenient way."
5787420,5791300," But what I can do is I can definitely forward that."
5791300,5793100," Actually, I'm going to have Bell forward that."
5794620,5798620," To the head of the lab and that's something that they can at least explore"
5798620,5800780," for the creation of our test suites."
5800780,5802180," Thank you for asking."
5802180,5804940," And I'm glad you had fun at the land."
5804940,5806660," I, I also had fun."
5806660,5808260," Oh, and was awesome."
5808260,5810380," Yeah, I, I had a, I had a blast."
5810380,5813220," I, we should probably, wow, we should probably talk highlights, hey?"
5813220,5814420," Yeah, I'd be down."
5814420,5816220," Um, beating everyone."
5816220,5818180," Beating everyone at left for dead."
5818180,5821060," I mean, okay, that was kind of mean though."
5821060,5823900," Was it like Bell, Bell, Bell, Bell, Bell, Bell."
5823900,5825100," Two of them is going to happen."
5825100,5825940," We did."
5825940,5828260," They all knew they signed up for that."
5828260,5835020," Yeah, we, we basically assembled a team, uh, like a, a crack team of leopard"
5835020,5840620," ed players and I got up on the microphone and said, assemble a squad."
5840620,5847140," If anyone can beat us, I will give every member of your team a backpack, an early"
5847140,5852220," screwdriver, hand built by Kyle, head of engineering at creator warehouse and"
5852220,5855660," 250 US dollars in store credit at LTT store."
5855660,5858420," So naturally teams were a,"
5858420,5859380," people made the teams."
5859380,5859620," Yeah."
5859620,5864980," People signed up for the tournament and one by one, we absolutely."
5864980,5870060," Oh, it wasn't even fair."
5870060,5877820," We had Chase who is just like a mad lad in general and who is really good at"
5877820,5883060," leopard ed. We had Bell who streamed probably hundreds of hours of leopard ed back in"
5883060,5884780," the day. We've got me."
5884780,5890060," I've got 250 300 hours of leopard ed one and leopard ed two under my belt."
5890060,5896780," It's been a while, but like there's a big difference between having 250 hours of"
5896780,5899980," leopard ed playing on like public servers and me."
5899980,5905820," The vast majority of my hours were with a crew that did nothing but get home from"
5905820,5907420," work and play leopard ed."
5907860,5910300," With some really like legit."
5910300,5913740," You sharpen that sword a lot, a lot more than just like randomly playing against pubs."
5913740,5914620," Absolutely."
5914620,5914860," Yeah."
5914860,5918060," And so the vast majority of my hours are playing with that, with that crew."
5918060,5922740," I have significantly less hours than everyone else that was on that team by like"
5922740,5928020," probably hundreds, but I've only really played with all of them."
5928020,5928580," Yeah."
5928580,5930500," So and you follow orders good."
5930500,5930980," Yeah."
5930980,5932380," And your FPS skills are."
5932380,5933140," Yeah."
5933140,5935100," That's that's my every, every once in a while."
5935180,5938060," I was, I usually did okay every once in a while."
5938060,5941980," If I got like the right zombie characters, I'd like top damage or whatever."
5941980,5944060," I really, my favorite ones, the spitter."
5944060,5945500," Oh, spitter so much."
5945500,5946460," So much fun."
5946460,5947060," So much fun."
5947060,5947420," Yeah."
5947420,5947900," Yeah."
5947900,5953340," And like it's not like Linus is quiet."
5953340,5956500," So any time that I'm like, not necessarily sure what I should be doing."
5956500,5958780," I just like, Hey, where am I going?"
5958780,5959620," Or like whatever?"
5959620,5961500," And I'll, I'll get information quickly."
5961500,5962540," But yeah, it was good."
5962540,5970020," And we ended up playing against like essentially my family and friends in the final."
5970020,5974820," So that was weird because like their team name is generally the team name that I'm"
5974820,5977860," under and we like had to beat them up, which was kind of funny."
5977860,5979140," Had to crush them."
5979140,5983540," It was, it was, there was a few funny moments where like I would just like take"
5983540,5987580," someone out or just like there was a boomer time where I got all four of them."
5987580,5989340," And I was just like brutal."
5989340,5992140," There was one time I was a smoker."
5992260,5993500," I was on top of the building."
5993500,5994940," You guys hit them all at the same time."
5994940,5997940," And I 100 to KO'd someone with the smoker."
5997940,5998380," Nice."
5998380,5999580," And I was like, yeah, let's go."
5999580,6006620," Linus against again, my crew did a charger run down a set of stairs and hit"
6006620,6008540," literally every single one of them."
6008540,6009980," It was awesome."
6009980,6012460," Yeah, it was pretty good."
6012460,6013300," It was pretty fun."
6013300,6013780," It was good."
6013780,6014580," Heart."
6014580,6019620," I mean, as much as I love just crapping all over noobs, though, I'd say the most"
6019620,6021620," fun that I had at the land was Halo."
6021620,6022820," See, oh, my God."
6022820,6023340," Gulch."
6023340,6024940," Whoo."
6024940,6028020," You can't you can't plan."
6028020,6029060," We can show the clip."
6029060,6030340," I was looking for it just now."
6030340,6030660," OK, OK."
6030660,6034100," You, I haven't found it yet, but you cannot plan this out."
6034100,6040540," OK, you can't have ranked players go into a tournament and set up teams this"
6040540,6041500," even."
6041500,6044940," And we basically just, Luke and I started up a lobby."
6044940,6049180," Each of us went to one of the teams and then we just broadcast the password on"
6049180,6053220," Discord and people flooded in randomly populated to the teams."
6053220,6056620," We broke it into separate Discord chats and I kid you not."
6056620,6061660," I have never seen a competition so even in my life."
6061660,6065140," We played eight V eight on blood Gulch capture the flag."
6065140,6072020," Three full rounds with neither team scoring a single flag capture and it got"
6072020,6074100," close to the end of the fourth one as well."
6074100,6078540," And then finally, finally, and it was like it was not because people didn't"
6078540,6082620," know what they were doing or weren't following instructions or weren't good"
6082620,6083580," FPS players."
6083580,6090460," If anything, it was just that each team had the perfect mix of elite tier players"
6090460,6093020," and slower in scrappers."
6093020,6095220," And there was just this part."
6095220,6097740," It was like playing Warcraft one, right?"
6097740,6101540," Where where the orcs and the humans are exactly equivalent."
6101540,6106260," Like you would have a swordsman and a and a what are they called grunts?"
6106260,6108380," They're they're just like swordsman equivalent ish."
6108620,6111460," And they would just go, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh."
6111460,6115180," And then the last two swords would hit each other at the same time and they'd both die, right?"
6115180,6118020," Like that that would that would actually happen in Warcraft two as well."
6118020,6122820," So so it would that was just how every conflict would go down."
6122820,6128740," Both teams would annihilate each other and respond over and over and over again"
6128740,6135180," until until finally, finally, the stalemate was broken by just a fluke."
6135620,6138500," Lucky situation to watch it back."
6138500,6143860," If if anyone's in the whale land discord, because it's still up, uh, if you can find"
6143860,6148020," the video and post it in general, because I can't really find it right now, I just"
6148020,6151700," don't remember what channel it's in, but if you can post it, it'll be really cool to show"
6151700,6153660," because it's actually crazy."
6153660,6155860," Like it's, it's pretty sweet."
6155860,6158820," Oh man, I was raging out so hard."
6159020,6166340," Luke, Luke mentioned that I'm not a quiet gamer, which is fair."
6166340,6166900," I like it."
6166900,6167860," I'm not complaining."
6167860,6169620," It's just it's a fact."
6169620,6178340," So when my driver, the driver of my warthog, who I asked to take, asked very politely and calmly"
6178740,6186380," asked, Luke was actually sitting next to me so he could hear me just like, no, no, no, no, no to my mic the whole time."
6186380,6187820," I would try not to."
6187820,6190900," I would try to mute my mic when I heard you actually saying commands."
6190900,6194060," And if I heard like, okay, we're going in whatever amount of time."
6194060,6196580," I would not relay that information."
6196580,6197700," I would try not to act on it."
6197700,6202020," But sometimes it was so loud that it would go through other people's mics in the"
6202020,6202620," convention."
6202620,6205980," And I would hear you saying it through my headphones from someone else."
6205980,6207620," And I was just like, okay."
6208220,6211140," So I tend to be a bit of a loud boy gamer."
6211140,6212660," We got it."
6212660,6217860," OK, do you want to send it to you on the chat or?"
6217860,6218380," Oh, yeah, sure."
6218380,6218540," Yeah."
6218540,6218700," Yeah."
6218700,6220020," If you send it to me here, I can just play it."
6220020,6225500," OK, so someone's hiding behind the base."
6225500,6226420," OK."
6226420,6232180," And they went, they stole one of the warthogs from that base happened to pull up right"
6232180,6237580," as some lone wolf rogue came out the back of the base with the flag, grabbed them."
6237580,6240660," Like it couldn't have been timed more perfectly if we were professional players."
6240660,6241700," Where will I find it?"
6241700,6243020," I'm just trying to figure out where to send it to you."
6243020,6243940," Oh, the doc."
6243940,6244820," Yeah, the doc is good."
6244820,6246100," Just right at the top is perfect."
6246100,6250140," So they're coming back and I'm like, guys, guys, you got to talk."
6250140,6251460," You got to communicate, communicate."
6251460,6252500," They're like, we got the flight."
6252500,6253300," OK, where?"
6253300,6254140," Where are you going?"
6254140,6254900," What can we do?"
6254900,6255940," What can we do to support you?"
6255940,6257060," They're like, OK, we're coming back."
6257060,6257940," Like which side?"
6257940,6258900," Where are you coming back?"
6258900,6260540," Like, oh, so I'm talking to my driver."
6260540,6261660," I'm like, go, go, go."
6261660,6262220," You got to go."
6262220,6262780," Go up here."
6262780,6264420," My driver."
6265020,6268860," Bless his heart, bless his heart, soul, mind and body."
6268860,6277020," OK, drives headlong into the warthog that is coming back after literally an hour"
6277020,6280900," of stalemate, an hour no one can score."
6280900,6286700," OK, drives headlong into the warthog that is carrying their flag back."
6286700,6288060," This is an eight V eight."
6288060,6291140," We are right next to the portal that comes out of their base."
6291140,6292900," I just."
6294740,6298220," Should be under the right above Intel slowing down."
6298220,6300540," Right above that topic."
6300540,6304740," OK, I'm like, I'm getting anxiety, just thinking back to it."
6304740,6305260," OK, here it is."
6305260,6310580," Fortunately, fortunately, the the cap, I believe."
6310580,6318100," Yeah, yeah, the the capper managed to manage to scream record and upload the whole thing."
6318100,6323860," So this particular player on our team was kind of playing hide, hide up near the base,"
6323860,6326340," kind of take pot shots or whatever."
6326340,6329140," One of the things we were trying to do was accumulate all the hogs"
6329140,6332300," so that we could do like a four word hog push."
6332300,6333900," Look at this."
6333900,6336540," Didn't know they were coming because people don't communicate."
6336540,6339460," I had no idea in CE, you could get in the gunner seat with the flag."
6339460,6341060," That also confused the crap out of me."
6341060,6343020," A lot of people were shooting at the passenger seat."
6343020,6344180," So we're actually missing them."
6344180,6344700," Nice."
6344700,6348140," So this is my hog that drives headlong into the."
6348140,6350180," I didn't see it."
6350180,6351340," Our hog crashed."
6351540,6354500," So I didn't actually see that they landed on all four wheels."
6354500,6355740," Nobody talks."
6355740,6358100," So I didn't know what the heck was going on."
6358100,6361340," We have someone in their base grabbing their flag who goes out the back,"
6361340,6365100," which you would think would be smart, but that's actually where they pulled up their flag."
6365100,6370340," They like barely make it through, but they capping crazy and scored."
6370340,6375700," Oh man, one nothing after four full rounds is absolutely wild."
6375700,6379500," I mean, that's the kind of thing I love it lands is the second that happened."
6379860,6381620," The end you could just hear."
6381620,6384740," Oh, yeah, just all over the room."
6384740,6387940," Like you can't there's playing online."
6387940,6389820," Yeah, it's fine, I guess, right?"
6389820,6392700," You don't get the same, but it's not the same."
6392700,6397020," And stuff like there's nothing better than dueling someone,"
6397020,6399660," finishing them off of the headshot and being like,"
6399660,6407580," the first round lettuce and I were like fighting over kills and then a one."
6408660,6410900," I thought it was me is, oh, do I won the second?"
6410900,6412260," Yeah, not even close."
6412260,6413660," The first one you either close."
6413660,6417220," I stopped going for kills because I started realizing no one is ever going to win the game."
6417220,6422020," And I followed suit because their team got way more organized."
6422020,6425700," Yeah, because it was like the the respawn timer."
6425700,6428860," I think the shortest response timer is like five seconds."
6428860,6432900," And then you have eight people and the flag return is instant."
6432900,6434220," If you touch it, it's just gone."
6434220,6437540," So actually getting one of the flags out is really hard."
6438540,6441300," But that's just I mean, one of the things pulled it off."
6441300,6443180," Just saying, just saying."
6443180,6445940," I mean, one of the teams had a commander who was able to."
6445940,6454580," I did make some sus calls here and then your four Warthog push thing was never going to work, by the way."
6454580,6458620," We had we had like beautiful strategies for that."
6458620,6461460," Yeah, sneaky boy Warthog though."
6461460,6464700," We also did not with like the spring bounce."
6464700,6471260," If that's one thing that I think might people not people might not know is there was like grenades and stuff under that hog."
6471260,6473180," If it stayed on the ground, it was dead."
6473180,6480580," The fact that it got ran into and did a perfect flip in the air and landed with like still having momentum."
6480580,6482540," Like what was amazing."
6482540,6485020," It's actually such a cool clip."
6485020,6488900," I seriously doubt there's clips that have like the exact same series of events."
6488900,6491100," Oh, and it's an ancient game that people played a ton."
6491100,6491980," So that's super cool."
6491980,6494300," Yeah, it was it was awesome, man."
6494460,6495900," Yeah, that was that was really sick."
6495900,6497660," Love Land Gaming."
6497660,6506620," Although I think my favorite moment was when I hoodwinked literally everyone at the entire event."
6506620,6512700," Including me and I was sitting right next to it in the minor VGA competition."
6512700,6515100," Okay, minor VGA."
6515100,6518140," Pretty tough game, pretty unforgiving game."
6518140,6518540," All right."
6518540,6520060," We gave people what was it?"
6520060,6521340," 10 or 15 minutes?"
6521340,6522300," Yeah, it wasn't that much."
6522300,6526300," To accumulate as much money in their bank account as possible."
6526300,6532460," And at the end of it, I was like, oh, that's no way that anyone's going to beat me at minor VGA."
6532460,6536540," And we actually had someone who did shockingly well."
6536540,6538620," Like they had what like 5000."
6538620,6539500," That was a lot."
6539500,6541980," Like, oh, like far and away more than anyone else."
6541980,6543100," Did they win a gaming PC?"
6543100,6544220," I think so."
6544220,6544780," I think so."
6544780,6546940," Yeah, they won absolutely wild prize."
6546940,6547500," But anyway."
6547500,6548940," Sick gaming PC too."
6549660,6556540," Before I admitted that they won it, I went back to my machine."
6556540,6558780," I was like, I'm going to win this one."
6558780,6562780," And I managed $15,000."
6562780,6564380," $15,000."
6564380,6567100," That's nearly end game for minor VGA."
6567100,6568860," I had like all the items."
6568860,6570300," I had the four leaf clover."
6570300,6571500," I had the wedding ring."
6571500,6572540," I had the condom."
6572540,6572860," Okay."
6572860,6574220," I had everything."
6574220,6575740," That is an item in the game."
6575740,6576620," That is an item in the game."
6576620,6576940," Okay."
6576940,6577900," You got to get the condom."
6577900,6578540," Okay."
6578540,6579260," Play it safe."
6579260,6579980," You know what I'm saying?"
6579980,6581580," So I had the condom."
6581580,6585340," And, you know, everyone Luke included."
6585340,6587260," I was like, Luke, did I cheat?"
6587260,6588380," He looks over at my computer."
6588380,6589980," He's like, well, not only that."
6589980,6593580," I was playing next to him part way through."
6593580,6595020," I'm like, man, this is really hard."
6595020,6596700," Cause I've never really played before."
6596700,6598940," Cause I knew it was coming, but I didn't like practice or anything."
6598940,6601660," And I was like losing money."
6601660,6604460," And I thought I was doing the right strategy, but I wasn't."
6604460,6606700," Like I told me how to play after that."
6606700,6610780," But I glance over and he has this amount of money."
6610780,6612700," And he's like basically given up."
6612700,6613660," And I was like, what?"
6613660,6614460," You have whatever?"
6614460,6618780," The thing that convinced me about it was that you didn't seem to care."
6618780,6622300," Which was really, I was very smart."
6622300,6623740," Cause you just kind of like shrugged it off."
6623740,6624940," And you're like, yeah, no, it's going to beat me."
6624940,6628460," And I was like, okay."
6628460,6629180," All right."
6629180,6630220," Sounds good."
6630220,6632220," So I was convinced cause I was sitting right next to him."
6632220,6635580," Never saw him open the VM cause I was focused on trying to lay in the game."
6635580,6640780," But so I had a game that I had already played for like two hours."
6640780,6644060," Because I was ripping footage for the upcoming channel Superfun where"
6644060,6646700," Colton and Dennis attempt to hide in my house again."
6646700,6652540," And the way that the downloader works from the Ubiquity UI is that you,"
6652540,6653820," it breaks up the files."
6653820,6660620," And you can only confirm the save location of the file once each one is done."
6660620,6664700," And so I was just stuck sitting at my computer confirming downloads."
6664700,6668220," Cause it's like 200 files or something stupid like that for all the different cameras"
6668220,6670700," and all the time span that we, that we had to record them for."
6670700,6672780," It's so I was like, ah, screw it."
6672780,6675020," I'll, I'll play minor VGA in the other tab."
6675020,6678940," So then what I did was I left my computer in a state where"
6678940,6683580," I would land on minor VGA in kind of a believable scenario."
6683580,6686140," So I went down, sat at my computer, like started one,"
6686140,6689980," fresh, and then I was like, team viewer, but, but, but, but, but,"
6689980,6691180," hide, hide interface."
6691180,6692700," Okay."
6692700,6693100," Yeah."
6693100,6693100," Yeah."
6693100,6693740," I'm doing good."
6693740,6694460," Yeah."
6694460,6700460," And I even had Luke check my computer when I was like, yeah, I did way better."
6700460,6701660," He's like, no, it's legit."
6701660,6702060," It's legit."
6702060,6703420," I'm like, are you sure?"
6703420,6704700," He's like, yeah, it's legit."
6704700,6705260," Like, legit."
6705260,6707900," I didn't notice there was, there was the little like,"
6707900,6709420," cause it was a full screen and stuff."
6709420,6712060," There's just the little tiny drop down thing at the top."
6712060,6715180," And I think there was like a mic in the way or something."
6715180,6717980," Someone on the other side of the table was like, no, it's there."
6717980,6719900," And I had to lean around to be able to see it."
6719900,6720700," It was awesome."
6720700,6721340," Yeah."
6722780,6723500," Oh boy."
6723500,6725260," I had so much fun with that."
6725260,6725740," That was really cool."
6725740,6729020," The winner of Space Cadet table played on a steam deck."
6729020,6730380," Yeah."
6730380,6731420," That's actually pretty cool."
6731420,6732460," That was hilarious."
6732460,6735020," There was the Counter Strike tournament,"
6735020,6740060," which I enjoyed because usually at most lands that I've been to,"
6740060,6741580," that there is a Counter Strike tournament,"
6741580,6744860," some like local team will show up."
6744860,6747500," And it's just like, not even remotely close."
6748540,6752940," But all the like, like quarter semi and actual final,"
6752940,6754860," every single one of them was down to the wire."
6754860,6755820," That's awesome."
6755820,6757340," Which was really cool."
6757340,6758540," And like that's super cool."
6758540,6759980," That was, that was actually sweet."
6759980,6762620," It like actually felt like a real tournament,"
6762620,6764620," despite being kind of the opposite."
6764620,6766300," Cause it was mostly just a bunch of randoms."
6766300,6768780," But it wasn't like just a complete slaughter"
6768780,6770860," by like one pro team or something like that."
6770860,6772380," That's so important for fun."
6772380,6777580," I would rather have lost that Halo match than one it easily."
6777580,6778060," Yeah."
6778060,6781980," Like just a close game is so much better than a blowout,"
6781980,6783820," no matter which side you're on."
6783820,6784540," Yeah."
6784540,6788700," The multi like flash game style tournament thing was really cool."
6788700,6791820," I'm very happy that it culminated with Nidhogg."
6791820,6795900," Cause Nidhogg is such a cool like 1v1 like,"
6795900,6796380," oh yeah,"
6796380,6797740," stressor type of game."
6797740,6798140," Oh yeah."
6798140,6800060," So having it end with Nidhogg was awesome."
6800060,6802540," The fact that I got robot unicorn attack in there was cool."
6802540,6805660," Yeah."
6805660,6806220," Yeah."
6806220,6806620," Yeah."
6806620,6809100," We had some good space cadet table players there."
6809100,6810140," I thought I was pretty good."
6810140,6811500," I played a lot when I was a kid,"
6811500,6813100," but I was not even close."
6813100,6814060," In fairness to me though,"
6814060,6815740," you saw how leg it was running on my machine."
6815740,6816220," Mine was."
6816220,6816940," I don't know what was up."
6816940,6817980," It was pretty brutal."
6817980,6819660," I could barely even shoot a new ball."
6819660,6822460," Like it was it was totally totally glitched out."
6822460,6826220," Yeah."
6826220,6826460," Yeah."
6826460,6827180," Land was really good."
6827180,6829740," All right."
6829740,6831660," Why don't we jump into another topic?"
6831660,6834780," What else did we say we would talk about?"
6834780,6835980," When did we start the show?"
6835980,6836540," I don't know."
6836540,6838780," Oh, how long have we been streaming?"
6838780,6839500," That's what I was wondering."
6839500,6839980," It's eight."
6839980,6841260," It's about two and a half hours."
6841260,6843420," Oh, we should probably call it at some point."
6843420,6843660," Geez."
6843660,6845980," We have we've hardly even touched the merch messages."
6845980,6848620," There's just been a lot."
6848620,6851580," I don't know if the rest of the topics are like all that interesting."
6851580,6854300," Well, I definitely want to talk about how there are now two Google meets."
6854300,6855260," Okay."
6855260,6859420," I heard about this and my eyes rolled into the back of my head"
6859420,6862620," and I moved on because I didn't even want to know what was happening."
6862620,6864220," So yeah, what what is it?"
6864220,6868380," Um, Google now has two two Google meets."
6868380,6873660," It's not enough for them to have competing video chat products internally."
6873660,6879820," Now they actually have the same name even though they're different programs."
6879820,6885260," In fairness, in fairness, Microsoft, I think was the first to this innovation"
6885260,6889900," with their multiple versions of Skype and now multiple versions of teams."
6889900,6890860," Wasn't okay."
6890860,6891500," Hold on."
6891500,6892860," Wasn't it Skype for business?"
6893580,6896380," Yeah, but still that's clear enough."
6896380,6900300," No, just log in with a business log in freaking account"
6900300,6903580," and have business features you idiots."
6903580,6907500," No, no, you don't have Skype for business and Skype."
6907500,6910700," I think there's different ways that it's like actually built."
6910700,6915580," Well, then pick the one that's good and use that one."
6915580,6916620," Yeah, it's probably more expensive."
6916620,6920060," I mean, it's like, wow, back when they used to have two separate freaking kernels"
6920060,6923340," for their operating system, the good one for business."
6923340,6924940," And the crap one for home."
6924940,6927980," So to get rid of the crap one."
6927980,6929180," That one's less defensive."
6929180,6930140," Obviously."
6930140,6932060," Obviously."
6932060,6934700," Who's in charge?"
6934700,6936220," Skype for business was link."
6936220,6936780," Yeah."
6936780,6939100," And in my opinion, that was a better name, to be honest."
6939100,6941020," Sorry."
6941020,6943260," I'm kind of angry about this kind of crap."
6943260,6944780," So tell me about the two meets."
6944780,6945180," All right."
6945180,6949260," Google Meet was originally launched as a Zoom-like video communication"
6949260,6952140," successor to Hangouts, which hilariously still exists."
6952140,6955500," The fact that all the video, like video-to-video communication"
6955500,6962380," companies allowed Zoom to like become what it is, is pathetic."
6962380,6963980," I'm sorry, but it is."
6963980,6965660," From January to April 2020,"
6965660,6970620," meets user count grew by a factor of 30, with roughly 100 million users per day."
6970620,6974380," Google Duo was launched earlier as a one-to-one and group call app"
6974380,6976860," meant for smaller scale use."
6976860,6978780," Think FaceTime, Skype, or Discord."
6979660,6983340," If it's scalable, then f***ing use it."
6983340,6987420," If it's not scalable, then put it on the shelf."
6987420,6987900," Goodbye."
6987900,6992860," Why do you need a good scalable one and a crap, not scalable."
6992860,6993180," Sorry."
6993180,6993500," Sorry."
6993500,6993740," Okay."
6993740,6998380," As the pandemic went on, the need for both styles of communication grew"
6998380,6999500," and so did the apps."
6999500,7005180," As a result, Duo, as the smaller service, has been free-branded Meet."
7005180,7009260," And we'll receive the features from both apps and Meet is still Meet."
7009260,7010380," So we have two meets."
7010380,7013100," So what?"
7013100,7013420," Meet."
7013420,7014620," It's not even like a business."
7014620,7017260," They're both business or consumer."
7017260,7020380," So Meet is compatible with both Duo and Meet,"
7020380,7022700," but Meet is compatible only with Meet."
7022700,7029340," Eventually, the old Meet app will be phased out in favor of the Duo app"
7029340,7032060," with Meet functionality, which is now being called Meet."
7032060,7033820," Aaaah!"
7033820,7035500," This is adorable."
7035500,7037900," How did this stuff happen?"
7038700,7042620," [pause]"
7042620,7044940," Users of Duo don't have to do anything."
7044940,7049900," The app was updated automatically with Meet support last month."
7049900,7052300," It has icon changed earlier this week."
7052300,7054860," I'm assuming its name?"
7054860,7057260," Want to see something that makes me really angry."
7057260,7061740," As someone who used Hangouts as our internal business chat"
7061740,7065740," as part of G Suite for so long, then switched off of it."
7065740,7068860," First to Slack, which we had issues with."
7068860,7069900," Was it Slack?"
7069900,7071260," I wasn't a part of that."
7071260,7072220," I think it was Slack."
7072220,7077260," First to Slack, then to Teams, both of which we had numerous issues with Hangouts for all its"
7077260,7080300," warts and all its simplicity did mostly just work."
7080300,7084060," And was convenient because it was always open in a Gmail tab."
7084060,7084620," That way."
7084620,7085100," Always."
7085100,7085420," Okay."
7085420,7090620," So every time I see this, I get irrationally angry because they told me Hangouts is going away,"
7090620,7092380," so we like rush migrated off of it."
7093100,7098860," Now, when you go to share something in Android and you click Gmail, it fricking prompts you."
7098860,7101580," Gmail or chat?"
7101580,7102220," No."
7102220,7103020," No, no."
7103020,7103900," Gmail."
7103900,7108300," You told me chat, which is what Hangouts is now, the one that's built into email."
7108300,7109580," You told me it was going away."
7109580,7111580," I believed you."
7111580,7114860," That's what I get for believing anything you say."
7114860,7119020," When I click Gmail, I mean a **** email."
7119020,7120060," That's what I mean."
7120060,7122700," Don't make me press more buttons."
7123180,7126460," And the hilarious thing is that, oh, okay."
7126460,7127100," It doesn't."
7127100,7127980," It doesn't right now."
7127980,7131820," So I'm not sure why, but there used to be a chat."
7131820,7133020," Oh, this is chat."
7133020,7134060," This is different chat."
7134060,7136300," No, no, that's because that's there's a standalone chat app,"
7136300,7138700," aside from chat built into the Gmail app."
7138700,7142060," How are they so bad at this?"
7142060,7149260," So Bell said that the the meet app on his phone is now named Meet and then original in brackets."
7151340,7152940," Yeah, just updated one day on my iPhone."
7152940,7154380," I was like, what is this long name?"
7154380,7156220," That is so funny."
7156220,7159020," Yeah, minus that too."
7159020,7160460," What the heck?"
7160460,7162460," Wow."
7162460,7164540," Crazy."
7164540,7167340," All right, let's talk merch messages."
7167340,7169260," I got a I got a lab to pay for."
7169260,7170540," Read me merch messages."
7170540,7170860," Wow."
7170860,7172540," From Calvin."
7172540,7176540," Hi, I've been following your coverage on the use of HDR video very closely."
7176540,7179420," And the updates announced to HDR in the future."
7179420,7180300," We did one."
7180300,7181740," We did one recently."
7181740,7185660," The the video on glossy monitors on the eve excuse me,"
7185660,7189020," dough spectrum is in HDR."
7189020,7192060," So if you watch it on an HDR compatible display with HDR enabled,"
7192060,7196460," you will experience it in HDR and for videos about displays in particular,"
7196460,7199100," it is a huge difference maker."
7199100,7205500," It really helps you to better see through the screen the differences between two two"
7205500,7206700," different experiences."
7206700,7207820," It's more true to life."
7208780,7213340," From militant."
7213340,7214140," Oh, hold on."
7214140,7215900," I saw a little bit more to that merch message."
7215900,7217100," And yes, we've learned a lot."
7217100,7221500," We are working closely with Adobe and with YouTube."
7221500,7224060," There seems to, I don't know if I can take credit for it,"
7224060,7228700," but there seems to be a fire lit in the online video streaming industry"
7228700,7231900," to better support HDR."
7231900,7233500," And I'm really excited for it."
7233500,7240860," We are we are moving slowly but surely toward HDR, particularly on LTT."
7240860,7243660," There have been two to three video, someone in flow plane chat said there have been two"
7243660,7245500," to three HDR videos on flow plane."
7245500,7251740," There has been, but I will admit, they're quite the pain to get going."
7251740,7257980," And we do need to update our steps so that it can be done better."
7257980,7259500," Fortunately, the king has returned."
7259500,7261340," Yeah."
7261340,7262540," Well, that we're not."
7262540,7263020," Yeah."
7263020,7263420," Yeah."
7263420,7264380," That's all I'm saying."
7264380,7264940," Yeah."
7264940,7266060," Flow plane people will know."
7266060,7266780," Sure has."
7266780,7269580," I had a wonderful day."
7269580,7271820," Me too."
7271820,7277020," Actually, my day was pretty chaotic, but that was a good, that was a high point."
7277020,7277980," It was a good moment."
7277980,7278300," Yeah."
7278300,7281340," From militant."
7281340,7283340," Hi, Luke and Linus, longtime fan."
7283340,7285100," I wanted to ask what you think of smart watches."
7285100,7286940," Are they a fad that have run their course?"
7286940,7290300," Will they become a ubiquitous gadget on everyone's wrist?"
7290300,7291500," Remain a niche product."
7291500,7292620," Like I feel they are now."
7293500,7293980," Yeah."
7293980,7297660," I really want them to be good, but I give up."
7297660,7303100," So I'm just using the wittings, you know, one that is a clock and last for a month."
7303100,7305900," And I guess there's like some heart recording stuff,"
7305900,7307260," but I don't really care about any of that."
7307260,7313020," I have always done really, really bad with any accessories that you wear."
7313020,7318940," If they're glasses, I will lose them or drop them or step on them."
7318940,7321980," Is that why you don't wear glasses?"
7321980,7322620," Yeah."
7322620,7324380," Oh, that's sort of sad."
7324380,7324700," Yeah."
7324700,7326860," I'm not even kidding."
7326860,7328380," I have a pair of glasses."
7328380,7334300," Don't you have a close associate who literally works in the glasses industry?"
7334300,7335420," That's why I have two."
7335420,7336940," I have sunglasses and I have those."
7336940,7338220," The sunglasses."
7338220,7339260," You don't wear them."
7339260,7342620," Never leave my car, ideally, because if they do, they will be gone."
7342620,7345980," Because you know, you know how, like, if I leave your house,"
7345980,7349340," what percentage chance would you say that I have to come back to get my keys?"
7349340,7349980," Oh, yeah."
7349980,7351500," Yeah."
7351500,7352060," Yeah."
7352060,7352780," There's no number."
7352780,7353580," It's just, yeah."
7353580,7353580," Yeah."
7353580,7354060," Yeah."
7354060,7354220," Yeah."
7354220,7360140," So like, that type of stuff, if it's a ring, if it's a watch, if it's glasses, if it's a necklace,"
7360140,7360860," it's gone."
7360860,7364700," And I just like know that about myself, so I don't wear any of it."
7364700,7366460," And that's it."
7366460,7368060," So like, I think they're cool."
7368060,7369740," I think it's not for me."
7369740,7373580," I would go with something like that, where it's relatively simple and toned down,"
7373580,7377580," because I honestly wouldn't want to like, daily charge a watch that would just be very annoying to me."
7377580,7380060," Yeah, it's all about battery life."
7380060,7385180," I wear the fossil hybrid HR for the same reason I get steps and basic stuff for two weeks,"
7385180,7387420," and that's better than charging an Apple watch every day."
7387420,7388380," Yeah, that's pretty good."
7388380,7392860," From Sal, question for Luke."
7392860,7395900," You mentioned it did freelance IT work before fully committing to LTT."
7395900,7397500," What did you do to find work to make it possible?"
7397500,7407580," This isn't entirely above board, but I haven't worked there in forever."
7407580,7410780," So whatever. Back when I used to work for Geek Squad,"
7410780,7416300," there was customers that would come in that would want things that are services that Geek Squad could not provide."
7416300,7420380," So in those cases, I would potentially step in."
7420380,7423820," That is how I got one of my clients."
7423820,7425660," That's pretty bad."
7425660,7426780," One of my main ones."
7426780,7428620," It was stuff that they literally didn't do."
7428620,7431180," Yeah, they're just like not really supposed to do that."
7431180,7431740," No, for sure."
7431740,7432300," Yeah, for sure."
7432300,7432860," Yep."
7432860,7433100," Yep."
7433100,7435340," I was very young."
7435340,7437180," With that and extremely poor."
7437180,7438060," That's fine."
7438060,7439260," I did what I did."
7439260,7440780," At least you didn't steal toilet paper."
7440780,7443100," Really?"
7443100,7444380," Like a long time."
7444380,7451180," But yeah, there was one guy who needed server work done on location."
7451180,7453100," Like this is not something that Geek Squad would ever do."
7453100,7454140," Oh, they'd never touch that."
7454140,7454620," No."
7454620,7458220," Like I only did stuff where it would never be something that they would do."
7458220,7464860," And then that got me some other jobs because he was business person who charged to other business people"
7464860,7467260," that had the same problem and then blah, blah, blah, blah."
7467260,7469100," And it just kind of growed from there."
7469100,7469900," Big growed."
7469900,7473500," It's pretty late."
7473500,7478380," Something that you can do though is just like go talk to businesses."
7478380,7483580," I've talked a few times about how like notaries in law offices and medical practices"
7483580,7484140," and stuff like that."
7484140,7488300," They need very good data storage and security."
7488300,7488700," Yep."
7488700,7490940," It needs to be extremely reliable, etc."
7490940,7494700," Be good so that you're not screwing them over because there is liability."
7494700,7500060," But yeah, then just go walk into places and be like, what is your solution like?"
7500060,7501740," Do you need a better one, etc, etc."
7501740,7502620," This is great."
7502620,7507820," And then he graduated to grossly misrepresenting his qualifications on his LTT application."
7507820,7508220," Love it."
7508220,7510220," All right."
7510220,7510780," What's next?"
7510780,7516540," Next one we have here is from radioactive Twinkie."
7517100,7522220," Hello, as PC enthusiasts and gamers do other redo routine risk exercises to keep your risk"
7522220,7525180," limber and to reduce the risk of carpal tunnel."
7525180,7536780," I play badminton, which involves a lot of squeezing and like these motions, these motions,"
7536780,7537820," squeezing motions."
7537820,7546300," So I probably unintentionally do a ton of risk exercise, but no, I don't go out of my way to do it."
7546300,7550620," When I was rehabbing a problem that I was having with my arm, I spent a lot of time with the"
7550620,7554060," power ball, like a gyro gyro ball."
7554060,7557980," And that worked really great for me, but other than that, no, I can't say that I do."
7557980,7560300," Nope."
7560300,7562620," Never been even remotely a problem with me though."
7562620,7573340," If I use a mouse that is not compatible with my grip, I'll get like ice shooting feelings"
7573340,7579900," through my wrist, but it hasn't been a problem with the Corsair M40 or 45 or whatever that one"
7579900,7581260," that I used for so long was."
7581260,7583100," And it hasn't been a problem with the G Pro Wireless."
7583100,7585900," So I'm pretty happy with where I'm at for that right now."
7585900,7586380," Yeah, I don't know."
7586380,7588700," I've never had any thing like that."
7588700,7589980," My wrists are kind of huge."
7589980,7593180," I don't know if that like helps at all, but yeah."
7593180,7596940," Question here from Alex."
7596940,7600300," A few years ago, I managed to make my hard drive burst into flames."
7600300,7604220," Despite having built multiple computers at that point, I'd never heard or assumed that"
7604220,7606220," PSU SATA cables were not cross compatible."
7606220,7609180," Do you have any other explosive stories?"
7609180,7616380," I'd say my best story just like lighting something on fire was probably,"
7616380,7619420," oh, I mean, I had one recently actually."
7619420,7620940," Okay, I got a couple of them, right?"
7620940,7624860," I tried to install a PCI card."
7624860,7629740," Oh man, no, I don't remember anymore exactly what I tried to do."
7629740,7634780," I wrote this out on the forum like back in the early probably nine years ago on the forum."
7634780,7642220," So I might tell the story wrong, but in a nutshell, I tried to install a PCI card into a."
7642220,7644860," Oh, no, I remember."
7644860,7645500," Okay."
7645500,7649980," I there was a PCI card that had some kind of a four pin header on it."
7649980,7657100," And probably it was for something to like some kind of breakout cable or something like that."
7657100,7664140," I mistook it for a four pin floppy female connector for like auxiliary power for the card."
7664140,7671500," So I plugged it in, powered on the system and promptly released the magic smoke that was"
7671500,7673020," inside that card that made it work."
7673020,7675740," I had a buddy who sorry, I thought you'd done."
7675740,7676620," No, no, go ahead."
7676620,7682140," I had a buddy who was fairly aggressively overclocking a computer and shot some blue"
7682140,7683660," flames out of the back of the power supply."
7683660,7685900," I like it, but I have never."
7685900,7691420," I think been in that scenario."
7691420,7695100," I managed to scorch the back of a motherboard just just a couple of weeks ago."
7695100,7696060," Nice."
7696060,7705420," Yeah, I was helping the neighbor build their PC and young neighbor and one of my son's friends."
7705420,7708700," And I wasn't paying close enough attention."
7708700,7714460," This is at least partially on me and he was trying to put it into the back of the IO"
7714460,7720380," shield spot and dragging it around on the standoffs, knocked a couple caps off the back."
7720380,7727580," So I made a clumsy attempt at putting them back on knowing that it was probably dead anyway."
7727580,7731580," And whether it was the scratches to the traces around it or whether it was something else."
7731580,7734780," You know, when you hear that sound."
7734780,7737020," It's bad."
7737740,7740220," So that was pretty recent."
7740220,7744780," Yeah, I haven't killed anything with like fire, you know, but I've I've"
7744780,7747580," bricked some stuff, but I guess it doesn't fit in this story."
7747580,7748540," Hit me."
7748540,7752060," From me, sale."
7752060,7754060," Excited to get my backpack."
7754060,7755820," Hope. Have you guys thought about making wallets?"
7755820,7759020," I'm a simple man."
7759020,7762140," I like to put my stuff in my wallet."
7764300,7767980," I feel like I just don't really I don't demand much of a wallet."
7767980,7770860," I use this I use this homemade one from Yvonne."
7770860,7778140," And I'm sure there are wallet connoisseurs out there who would who would ask for so much more"
7778140,7780780," performance from their wallet than I do."
7780780,7783100," But for me, it's just like."
7783100,7784300," It's beads and fees."
7784300,7786860," Yeah, can I can I reach the card?"
7786860,7791500," Can I can I flash my identification?"
7792460,7799020," I've had the wallet ever since we went to Germany for the the cherry tour."
7799020,7800140," Oh, wow."
7800140,7801100," That's a long time."
7801100,7804460," I bought a wallet while I was there because mine like literally fell apart."
7804460,7805980," I'm exactly the same one."
7805980,7809580," I've only ever owned three wallets in my entire life."
7809580,7811020," I have probably similar to me."
7811020,7813660," Used all of them until they disintegrated."
7813660,7819340," And then I have gotten a new one that is as simple and usually a gift actually."
7819900,7821580," I think two of them were gifts."
7821580,7826380," So I've gotten whatever simple basic black men's leather wallet has been handed to me."
7826380,7826860," Nice."
7826860,7827420," Yeah."
7827420,7828380," Yeah, that's how I roll."
7828380,7833180," From Sergeant Kilgore, great name."
7833180,7837020," Do you guys think modular phones will ever make a comeback?"
7837020,7838780," Also, do you have any opinions on Vtubers?"
7838780,7844780," Man, I had a Vtuber conversation with the whales at the whale land when I was doing the"
7844780,7848700," studio tour where I was basically saying, you know, I'm getting too old for this."
7848700,7851500," I'm getting too old to be the front man of this band."
7851500,7854780," And they kind of laughed, right?"
7854780,7860140," And I was like, no, like for real, I'm going to be 40, like in a few years."
7860140,7864700," I'm going to be not young and cool at all."
7864700,7867500," I mean, I was never cool, but I won't be young either."
7867500,7873260," And, you know, I think the next generation of tech enthusiasts are going to want a face"
7873260,7877900," that looks more like bears to tell them about their, you know, their tech purchases or whatever"
7877900,7882300," else. Like we have to, I have to realize that there's a shelf life."
7882300,7884860," How many Youtubers can you name who are over 50?"
7884860,7887900," Yeah, not many."
7887900,7889420," They definitely exist, but not many."
7889420,7892300," Part of that's because the platforms age itself."
7892300,7893020," Sure, right."
7893020,7894940," But then that's where I was going next."
7894940,7898140," How many prominent TikTokers are over 40?"
7898140,7899420," Right."
7899420,7900780," So there's going to be new platforms."
7900780,7905420," There's going to be new ways that the younger generation prefers to communicate."
7905420,7908860," And I am not necessarily going to understand it."
7908860,7910380," I'm not necessarily going to be there."
7910380,7919180," So one of the solutions to aging out of your media platform is going digital, right?"
7919180,7922300," And I think a really good example of this is Ryan's toy reviews."
7922300,7925820," Ryan's toy review started as a cute little kid unboxing toys, right?"
7925820,7931980," But obviously his parents who seemed to manage that particular media empire recognized very early"
7931980,7935180," on that their son wasn't going to be five forever, right?"
7935180,7941260," And so they built up a team of animators and writers and they built out content around"
7941260,7945100," Ryan's persona, around Ryan as a character, right?"
7945100,7949100," And part of that is just making sure that he wasn't being exploited, right?"
7949100,7953180," That he wasn't working 60 hours a week making making YouTube videos."
7953180,7954940," But part of it is the longevity."
7954940,7956140," And so..."
7956140,7959340," Red and white."
7959340,7960940," It's a viable strategy."
7960940,7963980," And I could just pursue cosmetic surgery, right?"
7963980,7966140," You know, try and look young for as long as possible."
7966140,7967020," Try and stay limber."
7967020,7971820," But that's going to run out at some point and I've got a lot of people relying on me."
7971820,7974060," So it's definitely something that I've considered."
7974060,7976300," Like, would you watch an animated review of something?"
7976300,7977180," I don't see why not."
7977180,7982140," I think and I've kind of always thought this and I know, I know, I know."
7982140,7984620," But I think you put too much stock into it."
7984620,7992940," I think if it was a piece of technology that was like totally out of your realm, sure."
7992940,7998380," But I don't think you lose legitimacy with like phones, VR tech and computers just because you get old."
7998380,7999340," Sure."
7999340,8001500," That is something from our generation."
8001500,8004780," Yes, but there will be things that are not from our generation."
8004780,8008060," Like, I don't have a ton of interest in things like smart speakers because"
8008060,8010380," I just grew up without them and I don't care about them."
8010940,8019500," And so I think that whether it's just the face, like, okay, so I won't look like someone who knows about"
8019500,8021740," whatever that new thing is."
8021740,8024380," And people do, they do generalize."
8024380,8026220," They do stereotype, right?"
8026220,8029660," So I just, I think it's something to be aware of."
8029660,8031420," We've had people in chat bring up Adam Savage."
8031420,8040300," Adam Savage is a great example of someone who has transcended, you know, generational gaps, right?"
8040300,8042860," I think Adam Savage is cool pretty much across the board."
8042860,8045020," But maybe that's the millennial in me talking."
8045020,8047260," Maybe Adam Savage isn't cool to young people."
8047260,8049260," I wouldn't know because I think he's cool."
8049260,8051980," So yeah, I don't know."
8051980,8054380," Bixby says I see old man Tech Wizard is more legitimate."
8054380,8057100," Sure. But how many of them do you actually watch every day?"
8057100,8059740," I just don't think there are that many."
8059740,8060540," Sure there are."
8060540,8062940," I mean, you could watch, you could watch Get Connected."
8062940,8065900," To see you even still make new videos?"
8065900,8068380," You could watch Rodney Reynolds."
8068940,8073180," I feel like I can hear hi, I'm Rodney Reynolds in my brain."
8073180,8078460," Does Leo LaPort still make content?"
8078460,8079100," I believe so."
8079100,8083500," Get connected."
8083500,8085740," I can't find out here."
8085740,8090140," Leo LaPort podcasts like, yeah, I think so."
8090140,8091180," Eight days ago."
8091180,8093180," Well, you guys got to make more content."
8093180,8095100," There you go."
8095100,8095340," Yeah."
8095340,8096460," See, let Pixel Buds Pro."
8096460,8099500," You can hear about Pixel Buds Pro from Mike."
8099500,8101740," It's one of those things."
8101740,8103260," I think this is someone else now."
8103260,8103420," What?"
8103420,8105420," Hold on."
8105420,8107420," We've got a Mr. Mr. Dad for Snackles."
8107420,8108780," That's a face that we recognize."
8108780,8110780," Yeah."
8110780,8112540," Okay, so they've hired a host."
8112540,8113420," Yeah."
8113420,8116380," He's definitely still host some of it."
8116380,8116780," I know that."
8116780,8118940," I looked at it not that long ago."
8118940,8121980," So, you know, it's tough."
8121980,8123900," It's something that I think about a fair bit."
8124940,8127020," Flowplain says I should get the Tom Cruise package."
8127020,8128060," Yeah."
8128060,8132780," I was watching Top Gun with Yvonne."
8132780,8136220," I remember it being a lot cooler when I was a kid."
8136220,8137740," Is the original Top Gun?"
8137740,8139580," Yeah, it's pretty hard to watch, actually."
8139580,8139900," Anyway."
8139900,8143980," And I was looking at the other people in that movie."
8143980,8146940," Whether it's Val Kilmer or whether it's, um,"
8146940,8148940," is it?"
8148940,8150460," Hold on a second."
8150460,8151420," No, no."
8151420,8153500," Robin Wright played the Princess and the Princess Bride,"
8153500,8155740," which I had no idea because when I was a kid,"
8155740,8157900," I didn't care about like who the cast was or whatever."
8157900,8160380," So I saw that in like my Plex."
8160380,8161260," No way."
8161260,8162540," That was Robin Wright anyway."
8162540,8166300," Uh, really?"
8166300,8168540," She plays Jenny in Forrest Gump."
8168540,8171580," She plays the, the, the Wifen House of Cards."
8171580,8172380," Okay."
8172380,8173260," Okay."
8173260,8176780," Well, anyway, Meg Ryan's in Top Gun."
8176780,8182220," And so you look at like, you look at everyone else in Top Gun."
8183180,8184220," Literally."
8184220,8184540," Okay."
8184540,8187260," Literally 35 years later, right?"
8187260,8193500," None of them have aged anywhere close to as well as Tom Cruise."
8193500,8195980," So yeah, whoever's doing his work, man,"
8195980,8198620," gotta get me some of that for real Z's."
8198620,8200860," It's Z new dude."
8200860,8201660," For real Z's."
8201660,8202540," He's making it happen."
8202540,8203980," Keeping him young."
8203980,8205420," All right."
8205420,8205980," What else we got?"
8205980,8211420," Uh, from Mark with the steady progression of human enhancement tech,"
8211420,8213420," what would be your line for what is too much to replace?"
8213420,8217260," Would you get an RFID implant or digital eyeball or something else?"
8217260,8217900," Oh, I'm down."
8217900,8222940," As long as it's like probably pretty safe and or I have like nothing to lose."
8222940,8228060," Like if I, if I lost my hearing, I'd be like first in line for a cochlear implant."
8228060,8228860," Like let's go."
8228860,8232540," If you guys start getting into biohacking, I'm in dude."
8232540,8232780," Yeah."
8232780,8237180," Next question here."
8237180,8240140," For Luke from Alex."
8240140,8242780," How do you and your engineers approach planning and road mapping?"
8242780,8244460," And how do you guys organize?"
8244460,8245660," Do you leverage scrum?"
8245660,8246620," Scrum."
8246620,8253100," So the whole thing of like agile and scrum is is almost, I've been paying attention to a lot"
8253100,8253820," of spaces."
8253820,8255740," A lot of people are kind of moving away from it."
8255740,8257980," It was very much the rage when we first started."
8257980,8266460," And we've kind of landed on a bit of a weird mix, which seems to be true for a lot of teams."
8266460,8269180," I don't know for everybody and I'm sure people can be like,"
8269180,8271020," well, my team does what I know."
8271020,8272140," I'm not talking for everybody."
8272140,8277260," But our mix is that we do twice a week meetings."
8277260,8280380," So we do a meeting at the end of the week and we do a meeting near the end of the week,"
8280380,8282940," Monday and Thursday, generally."
8282940,8284700," Those meetings are supposed to be fast."
8284700,8287740," They're not supposed to take a lot of time."
8287740,8293420," We've had those meetings that last less than five minutes in total, not per person."
8293420,8294940," They're supposed to be quick."
8294940,8296700," They're not supposed to take a lot of your day."
8296700,8301660," And that's like the stand up from the scrum mentality stuff that we do."
8301660,8308060," But then we dive into Canban with like issue tracking and task tracking boards"
8308060,8310540," that people manage themselves and yada yada yada."
8310540,8312940," Planning and road mapping."
8312940,8320540," Planning, as much as I can try, often just has bombs dropped on it all the time."
8320540,8324940," And if people are in this space, I think they probably have experienced the same thing."
8324940,8328540," Whether that's line is just randomly coming in and be like, hey, guys, we're doing all these"
8328540,8329100," things now."
8329100,8329660," Good luck."
8329660,8330540," I needed a month."
8330540,8333260," Or if you usually give you a month."
8333260,8334460," Yeah, usually it's less than that."
8334460,8339180," Or if it's me doing effectively the same thing, to be completely honest."
8339180,8343980," Because I'll be like, oh, wait, this creator wants this thing."
8343980,8345820," So you're halfway through that."
8345820,8346380," That's cool."
8346380,8347820," What if you worked on this thing now?"
8347820,8353580," Especially with a small team, sometimes there can be staffing challenges and it's beyond our control."
8354620,8356860," Yeah, they were going to do that, but they didn't."
8356860,8357660," So here we go."
8357660,8359820," And it's not anyone's fault."
8359820,8363020," It just does still need to be the show must go on at the end of the day."
8363020,8366780," Development is inconsistent progress."
8366780,8369900," That is going to be a thing that you experience as inconsistent progress."
8369900,8374380," You'll have someone who will make absolute leaps and bounds in like two days."
8374380,8380380," And then they get stuck on something that like actually wasn't that difficult for like two weeks"
8380380,8386140," because they just happened to not approach it in the exact right way or see it from the"
8386140,8387260," exact right angle."
8387260,8392220," And they spend a bunch of time trying like more difficult solutions than what it actually needed."
8392220,8393980," And then they figure out that is something simple, whatever."
8393980,8395420," And that's going to happen."
8395420,8396300," And that's fine."
8396300,8397980," That just happens in this space a lot."
8397980,8401740," This is hilarious."
8401740,8402060," Sorry."
8402060,8402860," I'm just going to jump in."
8402860,8403820," This is from Twitch Chat."
8403820,8408220," Nido says, it's easy to say we need to plan better and end up in an infinite loop of meetings"
8408220,8410380," discussing how to plan and never end up doing it."
8410380,8410540," Yeah."
8410540,8412060," And a lot of times you just need to act."
8412060,8415980," So in regards to architecting too, like, I don't know, we do our best."
8415980,8420700," We try to figure out all the different components that are going to end up going into something."
8420700,8424940," But a lot of times, the Linus or me or someone else on the team,"
8424940,8429420," it doesn't matter is going to change what we need to do because we'll learn something"
8429420,8431260," or we'll experience something, right?"
8431260,8435340," We'll go, oh, this tool that's currently in development actually needs to work this way."
8435340,8436380," Or we'll get user feedback."
8436380,8437020," Or that."
8437020,8439020," So like sometimes things are going to change."
8439020,8444620," So we architect the best that we can to try to set ourselves up for the best possible result."
8444620,8452700," But I never, I think it's a fool's path to go into it, assuming that it's not going to change,"
8452700,8454460," sometimes potentially drastically."
8454460,8456300," Hopefully that answered your question."
8456300,8458620," This is, I could talk about this for a long time."
8458620,8460540," So that's the compressed version."
8460540,8461980," But yeah."
8461980,8463980," Nice."
8463980,8465660," The last question we have here is from Anon."
8465660,8469500," As a frequent phone switchers for smartphone reviews,"
8469500,8474060," how do you manage to transition to data, apps, messages and contacts between your temporary daily"
8474060,8475740," drivers? I'm a federal liable man."
8475740,8477260," Oh, it sucks."
8477260,8483340," That was one of the main reasons that I dailyed the note nine for so long,"
8483340,8489820," was that I just got tired of switching my daily driver, actual daily driver phone all the time."
8489820,8495180," So what I would do is I would mostly sloppy transition over to whatever I was reviewing."
8495180,8497660," And I would just have my note nine in my pocket for certain things."
8497660,8501980," Like I just didn't want to move my authy onto the one that I was reviewing."
8501980,8506460," Or I didn't want to move my WeChat was one that was really annoying."
8506460,8510860," Like I lost my entire WeChat history a couple of times because the process for backing it up"
8510860,8513500," and restoring it is like kind of arcane."
8515580,8519260," So yeah, I'm sorry. I don't really have like a perfect solution for you."
8519260,8521580," It sucks and it will always suck as far as I can tell."
8521580,8525420," It is what it is."
8525420,8527500," And it is over."
8527500,8530220," Thank you for tuning into the WAN Show."
8530220,8530540," Yeah."
8530540,8531500," We'll see you again next week."
8531500,8533100," Same bad time, same bad channel."
8533100,8533660," Bye."
8533660,8544220," Sorry I got it in the drama."
8544380,8549740," I didn't even, I was just like, \"Thank you.\""
8549740,8551340," Probably do the show and check the time."
8551340,8551580," Oh."
