0,4160," What's up folks welcome to the WAN show we've got a fantastic show lined up for you guys today"
4160,8840," I don't know about you, but I'm like a bundle of money. I am amped. I'm amped"
8840,15280," I'm going to the first land party in well that many years actually for me at this point"
15280,20140," Yeah, I it was right before COVID the past before COVID would have been my last one"
20140,26720," 150 people 150 people are over there waiting for us to show up play some VIGI games and"
27360,33320," Shortly before the show started I got the play button PC working again. It was overheating and it turns out"
33320,38840," There was an issue where the heat pipes cross each other like this in order to bring the heat away from the CPU"
38840,43440," Then out into the heat sink and the thermal pads that were in there weren't compressed enough"
43440,48120," Okay, so there was a thermal bottle neck, but we're good. We're good ladies and gentlemen"
48120,50680," And we've got a great show lined up for you today"
50680,55520," We're gonna be talking about the rumors that Intel's Ark desktop GPUs"
55560,60480," You know the ones where we had real live people from Intel sitting in chairs next to us talking about them"
60480,63260," Yeah, there are rumors now that that is canceled"
63260,68060," Cancelled you can't you can't cancel our GPUs. Oh"
68060,75620," Maybe you can there's been some stuff going on over it. I was waiting for you to see that. Oh my"
75620,83520," God this art this the write-up for this is literally three pages long. Okay, well, we'll talk about that in a little bit in other news"
84000,90280," Also Intel Optane is dead if you want obtain SSDs get them now"
90280,97120," Because they're not making any more of them. My goodness. What else we got other than all the Intel things"
97120,102320," You know, I guess we're we talked to overkill computers. We did"
102320,109320," And that's interesting boiler writer Pluf who chatted with them kind of on their side now"
109320,113260," Interesting yeah the how the turntables have turned"
113600,117440," Okay, that's gonna that that seems hard to accomplish"
117440,123720," So we'll we'll see what happened because that is interesting other than that. There's literally one topic"
123720,126880," It's AMD confirms for Ryzen 7000 CPUs"
126880,129400," Maybe by accident whoops"
129400,134800," It didn't work is my stream that's not working"
134800,136800," Try it"
136800,156060," The show is brought to you by AMD"
156060,164680," Secret lab and ubiquity. Oh, you bickwitties a Wancho sponsor. How fun is that? All right"
164920,170160," Why don't we jump good gravy right into this is a monster topic"
170160,176280," Yesterday, I don't know if it's still yesterday, but anyway Moore's law is dead"
176280,182040," released a video claiming that Intel's Ark may be canceled before battle mage"
182040,186920," So that's the second generation architecture after alchemist"
186920,194520," Cancelled before battle mage even comes out this apparently has not yet been decided"
194600,203880," But is being discussed internally because the whole project has apparently been a poo show and there are serious hardware level problems with alchemist"
203880,208080," Allegedly, so that's the the first generation architecture. This is"
208080,220760," That's the that's the streaming PC making that noise our streaming PC was all like there's a heat wave"
221840,225440," There's a heat wave and I do not like it fired my laser"
225440,229840," All right according to the rumor"
229840,238120," This is potentially tied to Igor's labs findings that have shown that the performance in games even tier one games"
238120,241600," So those are the ones that perform best on ark"
241600,248440," does not scale well with resolution and can have brutal API overhead"
248760,252400," This points to a potential hardware flaw in the scheduler"
252400,257640," Which would also help explain why the performance can be so bad without resizable bar enabled"
257640,264920," In his testing at low resolutions like 720p the a 380 struggled to get above 100 FPS"
264920,271360," Even though it was close to that mark at 1080p, which is a lot more resolution"
271360,276800," Can the viewers actually even hear that it doesn't seem to be bothering them"
277480,281040," Is that is that a is that a fan? I think so"
281040,286160," I think it's got to be a fan sounds like a fan or a pump or something"
286160,288240," All right, well at any rate"
288240,294760," Moore's law is dead has been saying for a while that Intel manufactured their cards in Q1 and that those dies"
294760,298600," Have been just sitting in a warehouse waiting to be packaged"
298600,303600," When they made these chips they assumed that the driver problems could be solved in the next couple of months"
303600,309720," Then in mayor June realized the problems were there to stay so then this is all allegedly they asked the a 780"
309720,315880," Which was supposed to be allegedly the top tier card which Intel says never existed and will only be launching the lower end cards"
315880,323360," Apparently there were inconsistencies between what we were shown when Intel was here the other week and what is being shared internally"
323360,325880," so there's a"
325880,328440," thing here"
329360,334220," With some SKUs okay above is apparently a schedule handed out within Intel"
334220,338240," I guess I might as well just screen share with you guys here is my screen"
338240,342160," Here you go some SKUs with some launch sketch"
342160,349000," So here's a 360 at week 25, which is mid June and then supposedly early July"
349000,354960," We should be seeing a 770 a 750 and then later on the the middle middle tier"
354960,357520," so entry level high end and"
358040,360040," mid end"
360040,362160," The cards were supposed to start launching"
362160,369400," At this point aib's so aib's would be the ad-in board partners who actually manufacture the finished cards Intel"
369400,375560," Just makes the chips themselves at this point aib's are still in the dark as to what's going on"
375560,377980," Here are some quotes also from Moore's law is dead"
377980,385480," Source one to this day. We don't know what's going on source to why do you keep asking if arc is launching this month"
385560,389000," We have no evidence that it's in this quarter source three"
389000,394080," We're going to sit this gen out as much as we can without entirely burning bridges"
394080,398120," It's just taking too long and we resent being strung along like this"
398120,408000," This apparently is backed up by leaked internal Intel documents where the general general availability date is still to be"
408000,409360," determined"
409360,410840," Even a couple weeks ago"
410840,415200," internally Intel was saying cards would be delivered to SI's in July, but July is"
416040,422360," Going to be over on Sunday. I don't think they're going to be doing a lot of deliveries on Saturday and Sunday"
422360,427560," Yeah, probably not and you still cannot get an arc in a system integrator system"
427560,435320," A more recent Intel slide says arc story not arc launch in September"
435320,440680," All of which means that as of a month ago Intel was saying they would be launching all SKUs to OEMs in July and"
441080,445760," Add-in board partners would be launching in August, but it is now August essentially and that in board partners"
445760,449520," Still don't have the final bomb and design for any of them let alone the entire lineup"
449520,452880," It should be noted that when Intel came here, so I'm off"
452880,458840," I'm off the the script now when Intel came here. They showed us an Intel first party board"
458840,461440," not a third party board"
461440,467080," Whereas the a380 the one that's actually already launched. Well, that was with third party board partners"
468200,471360," Anyway, apparently all of this has quote annoyed"
471360,476800," Executives at Intel because they don't know what an arc story is and are tired of the chaos"
476800,481520," This annoyance can be felt in this quote from Intel's latest earnings call"
481520,484440," So this is from Pat Gelsinger Intel CEO"
484440,487400," This quarters results were below the standards"
487400,489720," We have set for the company and our shareholders"
489720,495240," We must and will do better the sudden and rapid decline in economic activity was the largest driver"
495320,498880," But the shortfall also reflects our own execution issues"
498880,507520," We are being responsive to changing business conditions working closely with our customers while remaining laser focused on our strategy and long-term opportunities"
507520,514320," Boy, is that ever a lot of words without saying anything sure is we are embracing this challenging environment to accelerate our transformation"
514320,517080," That sounds like CEO talk to me. Yeah"
517080,524360," That didn't even really sound like annoyed with arc specifically, but I you know arc is certainly something that hasn't gone perfectly this quarter"
524360,526120," Yeah"
526120,534960," Here are some leaked internal discussions allegedly there are high level discussions going on regarding the cancellation of dedicated desktop arc cards"
534960,540520," Data center stays for now, but the dedicated gaming card may be canceled before celestial even gets a chance"
540520,543480," Another source apparently said to Moore's laws dead"
543480,548640," I cannot confirm the cancellation of discrete gaming arc, but I also can't say it isn't being considered"
548640,554280," It could be what I can confirm is no good news is coming out of the graphics division at the mid-level"
554280,559960," And if they do cancel battle-mage marketing will still hype up arc until that decision is actually made"
559960,565160," Now this rumor I've also seen"
565160,572760," There could be plans to have an alchemist refresh in 2023 instead of launching battle-mage because that is allegedly also having issues"
572760,577280," Which could suggest there are silicon level issues with alchemist that can't be sorted out with drivers"
577280,580560," That would be if you're gonna refresh a sort of mediocre performer"
580720,584920," You'd think it was to like fix something. You know what I mean? Yeah, yeah"
584920,587600," This sucks"
587600,593680," Because I want this to do well because more competition the GPU space would be good"
593680,602560," But this sucks for two reasons one more competition in the GPU space would be good if it's not competitive"
602560,609800," It doesn't really solve that problem and also if it isn't allowed to stay on the market it by default doesn't solve that problem"
609800,611040," so"
611040,616320," Hopefully they can figure it out now obviously Intel isn't just taking this"
616320,624840," These whether you want to call them leaks or whether you want to call them rumors or allegations or whatever whatever it is"
624840,631040," They're not just ignoring this believe it or not. I would have kind of expected Intel to just say"
631040,637160," Sorry, no comment, you know until we announce something it's it's not happening"
637160,641880," But Raja Kaduri has already responded to tech journalist, and she'll sag"
641880,645720," Saying thanks, and she'll we are very much committed to our roadmap"
645720,650440," We are ramping alchemist and will continue to improve the experience you will see more updates from us this quarter"
650440,655240," A XG is also on track to ramp four new product lines by the end of the year"
655240,666640," Wow"
667640,675280," Now some of these things do kind of jive with my vibe if I could kind of put it that way"
675280,681440," So the overall opinion from Tom at Moore's law is dead is this Intel manufactured the dies in Q1 with plans to sell this summer"
681440,685440," Then things went quiet until the recent media blitz that we were part of"
685440,691520," And probably was brought on by our brutal a 370 m review"
692040,696800," Apparently this media blitz took people internally at Intel off guard because in there"
696800,700520," It's still a poo show and they have no clue when things will actually be launching"
700520,708600," Tom and this is Tom from Moore's law is dead read is that sometime in Q2 they discover there's a fundamental hardware flaw that can't be"
708600,712640," Fixed with drivers and will require adjustments to silicon the problem is your shareholders, right?"
712640,720440," They need to get what they've made out now and launch it as low-end cards in order to recoup at least some of the cost"
720440,726600," All of this has prompted the top brass it until to seriously consider if this is worth all the work given the problems with alchemist and"
726600,728200," apparently"
728200,730200," battle mage"
730200,733680," Sedge I"
733680,736520," Don't know man like I"
736520,744120," Have a hard time believing that Intel would allow this to be another project"
744880,752920," Laraby especially when you go back and look at Laraby was Laraby really a failure obviously as a desktop GPU"
752920,756460," Absolutely, it never it never even made it across the line, but it would become"
756460,763600," Knights landing Knights corner. It would become Xeon Phi which was a viable product line for Intel for years to come"
763600,766760," Yeah, and given that even the rumors"
766760,771480," Seem to suggest that the data center product is not going anywhere"
771480,775120," If you're going to build the data center product, I mean"
775120,779840," Doesn't it just make sense to also have a consumer product"
779840,786120," Shouldn't you shouldn't you have as broad a product line if you're going to build this IP as you possibly can"
786120,790160," I mean there's some reason that NVIDIA and AMD are doing that it's not though to be clear"
790160,793480," It's not that there aren't companies entirely focused on"
793480,798560," widely parallel compute devices for the data center"
798640,800640," um"
800640,807240," So yeah, this is this is one of our discussion questions from Alex who prepared this topic"
807240,809920," as"
809920,815960," Seen below it's not like CEO Pat Gelsinger isn't against killing something that isn't working out"
815960,822120," Optane has now officially gotten the axe, but the thing about optane was ran for a long time"
822120,827840," It did but for optane the writing has been on the wall for much longer"
827840,830800," I mean, that's what I'm trying to say is like oh I see what you mean"
830800,834120," Yeah, I could have said it a lot better, but but yeah, optane has been around for a long time"
834120,836120," Was the last time you heard about it?"
836120,841920," Well, the issue is that micron pulled out so Intel was left with basically no actual"
841920,847880," manufacturing capacity for optane and then it didn't say they had a ton of inventory still"
847880,854000," Yeah, and they had a ton of inventory that they were selling through the really wild thing is that I guess we're changing topics now"
854000,860320," The really wild thing is that the optane team was apparently showing off benchmarks for their persistent"
860320,863320," optane DC modules like a"
863320,866360," few weeks to go"
866360,872240," Look at this. This is next gen optane modules to go with Sapphire Rapid CPUs"
872240,877120," This lines up with what the previous topic was saying though where they were saying marketing will keep pushing it up"
877120,883000," Until the exact moment that it's canceled so then I think in back to this topic"
883720,885720," Let me have a look here"
885720,894440," Back to this topic what I was told prior to Wanchow it doesn't appear to be in my in my notes"
894440,899760," But what I was told prior to Wanchow is that we can expect a statement soon"
899760,906200," It's possible that this tweet from Raja Kaduri that I read out to you guys earlier is the statement"
906200,911200," But I was told by Ryan Trout that we could expect a statement refuting these claims"
912200,919080," Yeah, man, I don't know it's gonna be hard for us to say anything"
919080,922680," Without looking like idiots in six months. You know what I mean?"
922680,926800," I mean, that's the reason that we don't really focus on rumors"
926800,930840," Here we tend to wait for the actual product to arrive"
930840,937200," So in our case we had an actual Ark Alchemist GPU that we were able to in a limited capacity"
937640,942640," Use and evaluate and then you know from from my perspective"
942640,948520," That's it until I get retail hardware that is actually launching and then I'll be happy to evaluate it again"
948520,951480," But you can't ignore rumors like this"
951480,958400," I mean this is explosive for them after all these years after all these millions and millions and millions and millions of dollars"
958400,960520," To just say you know what?"
960520,962480," Screw it"
962480,964480," No GPUs. We're done. We're out"
966160,972240," It's weird. I don't like it. I don't like it. It's hard to take off the"
972240,978360," I don't even know what hat you would call this but the person who wants Intel to make GPUs hat"
978360,984440," You know what I mean? The enthusiast. Yeah. Yeah, the enthusiast hat. It's hard to take that off from a business perspective, honestly"
984440,986320," Yeah, I get it"
986320,992040," If you have if you have all this money going to this product if making it for literally any amount of time"
992280,998440," Further is going to cost a massive amount of money like this just just knowing what like the engineering that's going to have to go into that"
998440,1002320," Etc is going to cost like it will be piles of mountains of money"
1002320,1007200," And you know that your next release is like already screwed"
1007200,1013320," Yeah, I can understand questioning it from a business side, but yeah"
1013320,1017320," You don't go out of your way to lose money for 24 months. Yeah"
1018280,1025800," When you've already been losing money for 36 months, that's a that's a long time to get literally"
1025800,1028440," zero ROI like Intel"
1028440,1034080," I mean we know some of the high profile people working within the ark group"
1034080,1037120," I mean, it's not like people like Tom Peterson Roger Kaduri"
1037120,1039800," Ryan trout for that matter like"
1039800,1042840," Even the ones I can name off the top of my head"
1042840,1045000," ain't cheap"
1045000,1047000," to put it mildly and"
1047200,1050080," That's just I mean that's the tip"
1050080,1055400," Yeah, very surface the snowflake on top of this iceberg, right? So I"
1055400,1062480," Get it it's expensive project. I at the same time putting the enthusiasts hat back on it would be"
1062480,1069360," Really good if if and then this is this is where we get into problems because if they don't then it doesn't solve that problem"
1069360,1075880," But if Intel had a competitive GPU, I don't need it to be I think some people were expecting it to be like the best one"
1075880,1083160," I don't need it to be the best one. I need to be a competitive GPU if it's like a if it's like a 40 60 killer"
1083160,1086520," Then sweet if it's like better for it for then"
1086520,1092840," In a price of performance stance or or maybe it wins because its thermals are way lower or something like that than like"
1092840,1097940," Sweet or maybe 50 60 by the time we get out there. I don't know but like an"
1099000,1106880," Put on my conspiracy theory hat. Okay. Yeah, yeah, if what Moore's laws dead says is true that people internally were"
1106880,1112640," Blindsided by this media blitz that happened for our Calchemist"
1112640,1119000," If that's true is it possible that the media blitz was a strategy?"
1119000,1125880," To generate hype and generate support for the project because they knew it was possible that they were gonna get the axe"
1125880,1133880," So it's people internally trying to avoid the axe by making it by making it public getting gamers getting the community"
1133880,1139640," Hiped so that they can try and buy themselves some more resources and some more time. There's that possible"
1139640,1145040," I mean, I wouldn't put it. It's not impossible the iceberg you described has some smart people in it"
1145040,1148640," And especially as you described on top of it, so I wouldn't put it past them"
1152000,1157480," You know if this is genuinely the situation there there and I hope that's it then because like I don't want this to go away"
1157480,1164080," It's really easy to say that when it's not my millions and billions of dollars. Yeah, so like yeah, keep spending guys get her done"
1164080,1167360," Yeah, stop my money. Let's go"
1167360,1179160," So yeah, I hope they succeed because I want to see it I want to see it hit market and I would hopefully we'll do well"
1181080,1186000," And like if battle mages already screwed hopefully the third one that I always forget the name of"
1186000,1195280," Whatever it is hopefully that one they're able to fix it for if battle mages also screwed though"
1195280,1198440," That's not good. Yeah"
1198440,1203880," Because I mean okay alchemist not even out yet. It's now midway through the summer"
1203880,1209400," So our best case scenario is what alchemist is out in Q3 at this point, right?"
1209720,1215680," So we're looking like 2024 version 3 you need to sell some alchemist before you can launch battle mage"
1215680,1218360," Presumably so at best"
1218360,1223440," Best if battle mage still has problems. I mean what was really cool was recently"
1223440,1229120," We got to take a look at Intel's development process right when we toured their design facility in"
1229120,1231880," Tel Aviv and so"
1231880,1234520," What I know then"
1234520,1240040," From talking to them about how it works where the design goes to the fab and then it takes six to eight weeks"
1240040,1244240," And then it comes back and then they start evaluating it. They find a problem send it back to the fab"
1244240,1247680," Oh boy now we get to wait another, you know however many months, right?"
1247680,1254680," Like if there is a is a hardware level problem with early battle mage silicon which they would have right now"
1254680,1259600," That could push it into 2024 like you said and so if they're expected to you know"
1260600,1268120," Sit here and wait another year and a half to have any hope of making you know what consumer graphics card right what?"
1268120,1276040," $300 $400 right okay at best the ai B is gonna take you know five to ten percent of the margin on this $400"
1276040,1281640," There goes 40 bucks the retailer is gonna take five to ten percent. Let's say worst case scenario, right?"
1281640,1287320," Like there goes another 40 bucks. So that's $80 of your $400 until doesn't make every component of the board"
1287320,1292400," They don't make ram so there goes I don't know maybe another 50 bucks 60 bucks"
1292400,1300560," These things start to add how much margin is there actually in making a GPU and providing a reference design to board partners"
1300560,1308640," Especially when if if alchemist and battle mage are both screwed what is customer sentiment gonna be are you actually gonna even be able to ship that?"
1308640,1313320," So if you're making you know 150 bucks, let's say best case scenario"
1313320,1316240," You're making a hundred and fifty bucks per chip set now hold on a second"
1316240,1319480," No, no, no because I didn't even factor Intel's cost fapping the chip"
1319480,1324360," I got all carried away with the extra cost right they still have to actually fab the chip"
1324360,1329840," I'm not even stuff using up capacity that presumably they could use for something else as they build out. Oh"
1329840,1333120," That's the really scary one if I'm on the ark team"
1333120,1337040," Capacity"
1337040,1340640," Yeah, it used to be that Intel had a project"
1340640,1347680," They set aside their own fab capacity for their own project and that to a degree anyways is like it"
1347680,1354000," But if they could just sell this capacity to a third party like a TSMC or like a Samsung"
1354000,1359800," Then all of a sudden Intel's internal products have to compete for profitability"
1359800,1362560," for Intel's fab space"
1362560,1367880," With external products and it's gonna we know how long it takes fabs to come online"
1367880,1373080," I know I know there's been some complaining from the other companies about Intel getting this like whatever it's called"
1373080,1378500," But the grants they're getting to set up fabs in America. Yeah now hold on a second TSMC is fabbing"
1378500,1384680," Alchemist but I don't believe that TSMC has any kind of deal at least that we know of to fab battle mage"
1384680,1391480," So I'm talking I'm talking about battle mage when they're actually trying to get some kind of a return on this investment"
1391480,1393920," It's like okay. What's our best case scenario?"
1393920,1397680," maybe a hundred bucks a chipset I"
1397680,1400600," I'm just these are random numbers"
1400600,1404000," But it's got to be somewhere in between fifty dollars and a hundred and fifty dollars"
1404000,1407720," Just looking at all the other components that go into making up a graphics board"
1407720,1414040," And that's the problem with consumer hardware is that that silicon costs literally exactly the same as what you're gonna"
1414040,1417460," Put in a data center product but instead of making you know"
1418200,1423400," $1,500 on it you're gonna make 150 bucks just because the pricing is an order of magnitude higher"
1423400,1427720," Sorry what were you saying I kind of"
1427720,1432360," No, it's fine. I was talking about the American fab you know Intel's getting this yeah"
1432360,1437640," The chips act there's some other companies that are upset about it because they think it's giving an intel and unfair advantage"
1437640,1442440," That fab is gonna take a really long time to come online"
1442440,1445960," And it's not even started construction yet"
1445960,1450800," They haven't even broke ground because they were kind of putting a gun to the US government's head like hey"
1450800,1454240," If you guys don't like past this act we're not gonna like build any fabs here"
1454240,1459440," Which is yeah, so we're like that that that new fab isn't even in this conversation really yeah"
1459440,1462720," Because it's gonna be so far out that this thing is probably gonna be axed or"
1462720,1465680," dedicated to before then"
1465680,1470960," Now to be clear some of the chips act funding is set aside for fabulous makers"
1470960,1476560," but a big chunk of it is set aside for semi-conductor fabrication which Intel is"
1476560,1481800," one of the top three and TSMC and Samsung probably aren't building fabs in"
1481800,1488280," North America anytime soon actually I thought TSMC was looking at something well the chips act is pretty intense"
1488280,1495080," So they might be because of that no I think even before that yeah guys. I don't know that's that's sort of ringing a bell for me"
1495080,1497080," But I don't know all right"
1497080,1503240," What else is there for us to talk about oh we should definitely do some merch messages today because we have a big launch on"
1503240,1504800," LTT store"
1504800,1510840," Let me just head over to my screen no it is not the backpack. Sorry. Sorry not the backpack yet very soon very soon"
1510840,1512120," but"
1512120,1515240," Stealth hoodie pro is here. Thanks Bell"
1515240,1523880," We have improved the classic LTT stealth hoodie in every way possible"
1523880,1527680," It features a super comfortable sleek backed tech fleece"
1527680,1531860," Which is two layers of fleece meaning there's a small air pocket between them"
1531860,1537240," So it's got quite a lot of warmth for how lightweight it is. Did you hand me Luke's by any chance?"
1537240,1542320," There is a chance you do look pretty small. I have looks. Let's let's try this again"
1542320,1550000," We added supportive bar tacks on the corners of the front kangapoket an elevated line is tech tips word mark on the right arm and an"
1550000,1557440," elevated LTT logo on the left kangapoket we maintained the foam pocket on the right side added accent taping to showcase the black"
1557440,1564480," Bloody hell sorry and gray front contrast and shortened the hood draw cords for easier use"
1564480,1567760," And of course as always it features a ykk zipper"
1567760,1570000," So if you're a fan of the classic stealth hoodie"
1570000,1578920," This is the upgrade that you have been waiting for it's warmer more comfortable and just generally better in every way"
1579120,1584840," So if you guys want to grab one now's a good time to leave a merch message if there's something that you want to hear us discuss on the show"
1584840,1590680," When you check out on LTT store calm whenever we're alive there'll be a field to leave a merch message"
1590680,1595640," Bell our producer is gonna be monitoring those picking out some for us to discuss responding to others"
1595640,1600320," Otherwise it might just pop up at the bottom so you guys can go check that out LTT store"
1600320,1602600," Dotcom"
1602600,1607560," People are asking about the backpack cuz we've we've been saying it's coming soon for a long time now. We have them in"
1608240,1610240," There's there's some like"
1610240,1614240," Speccing out and and picture stuff. We have to kind of solve"
1614240,1618280," There's like pretty much no chance. It's not launching next week"
1618280,1624600," Love still pretty there's did you talk about these are these new? Yeah? Yeah?"
1624600,1631040," They're just a little bit just a little bit easier to use I just like that they're captive. Yeah, that's really nice"
1631040,1633520," Yeah, it's improved in every way"
1635120,1640240," Okay, I can tell you when we're opening up backpack. Oh backpack back orders"
1640240,1649420," It's going to be mid next week sometime probably Wednesday or Thursday. Okay, we had some issues with"
1649420,1652700," With some of the pictures we wanted to improve them"
1652700,1655360," Some of the copy on the website"
1655360,1661840," We have a we have a draft version of the site for it or the page for it rather that has a whole bunch of pictures and like text copy and stuff like that"
1661840,1663920," Some of it needed to be improved"
1664160,1670900," The good news is that the early reviews are in and they're kind of amazing this one from Steven is just like"
1670900,1675700," Incredible looking for a quality backpack. I found it"
1675700,1680360," This is someone who picked it up at the pop-up shop that we did"
1680360,1688040," Really? Yeah, amazing amazing right up and what's really cool is that Steven waited a little bit and"
1689120,1695400," Actually did a couple of overnight trips including a plane trip. Oh before writing his reviews"
1695400,1700840," He could like really give people the rundown on it. So cool strongly recommend checking that out"
1700840,1703480," Alright"
1703480,1706080," What to oh we should do sponsor spots"
1706080,1708000," Wait, oh"
1708000,1710000," We have a deal of the week"
1710000,1712720," Spend $100 and get a free tote bag"
1712720,1716640," You do have to add the tote bag to your cart and your cart must be $100"
1717600,1722760," Outside of the tote bag cost so if you picked up a stealth hoodie and a water bottle to stay hydrated"
1722760,1727920," Maybe some cable ties then you are ready to go you can get a free LTT tote bag"
1727920,1734320," And it's it's one of those like reusable bags that you could use a lot because like everything we do"
1734320,1736320," It's like way overbuilt"
1736320,1741720," Looks a little something like this. There's the black and white one and there's also the fun colorful one and we have two different sizes"
1741720,1744840," Do there you go?"
1744840,1751280," All right, the show today is sponsored by we'll talk about the overkill computers thing by the way right as soon as we're done"
1751280,1756720," AMD did you know that when you bundle an AMD Ryzen processor and AMD Radeon graphics card?"
1756720,1759200," You can get better gaming performance out of your hardware"
1759200,1764540," Thanks to features like AMD smart access memory fidelity FX super resolution and Radeon super resolution"
1764540,1767640," AMD is all about turning these things on together"
1767640,1772440," So that you can achieve up to a 66% increase in FPS compared to leaving them all off"
1772720,1776120," So with that in mind if you need to build or upgrade your gaming PC"
1776120,1780480," It's a great time to do it the game on AMD sales event is on now until August 5th"
1780480,1782320," Where you can get the best deals on AMD products?"
1782320,1788840," This includes the raise the game bundle featuring up to three games with select AMD Radeon RX 6000 series graphics cards"
1788840,1792600," And there are other great deals on Ryzen processors and Radeon graphics cards too"
1792600,1797580," You can check out all the ongoing deals that AMD has to offer at the link below how refreshing is this?"
1797960,1806280," Game bundles and sales on computer hardware. It's like Christmas is come early. It's Christmas in July"
1806280,1808560," It's like we transport ourselves into a different time"
1808560,1813880," I know right on a completely different timeline now shows also brought to you by secret lab"
1813880,1819040," Secret lab chairs are designed to keep you comfortable for those long nights of work and play"
1819040,1826000," They're Titan Evo 2022 offers four-way lumbar support comes with magnetic memory foam head pillow"
1826840,1828840," It's"
1828840,1833400," Kind of amazing because you can also move it around a little bit"
1833400,1837280," I like that part a lot the magnet surface is like pretty big so you can move it up and down"
1837280,1841440," I this the strap thing you can also move but you always risk it always comes up"
1841440,1846440," Yeah, it's so stupid and you risk it slowly creeping up and like popping off the top and stuff. Yep. It's nice"
1846440,1848440," It's offered in four different. Oh, sorry"
1848440,1855980," It's offered in different upholstery's like hybrid lead ret software fabric and nappa leather and best of all a five-year extended warranty is included"
1855980,1859600," Along with a 49 day return policy. So you're covered if anything goes wrong"
1859600,1864620," Go to the link in the video description and check out secret lab today just high quality chairs"
1864620,1871720," Guys we we wouldn't work with just any gaming chair company. I know there's this generalization that gaming chairs suck and"
1871720,1877360," It's true generally they suck secret lab doesn't suck. I can say that much with confidence"
1877360,1885900," Finally the show has brought to you today by ubiquity their G4 dome is a versatile weather and vandal proof dome camera with infrared LEDs for clear"
1885900,1890360," Around-the-clock surveillance can't say enough about ubiquity's image quality"
1890360,1895580," teaser for an upcoming channel super fun that was is almost entirely shot on ubiquity"
1895580,1899280," Yes, and that makes sense. I hid in my house again. Yep, and"
1899280,1905060," Sorry by the way, thanks to ubiquity's outstanding image quality Dennis"
1905060,1908120," Got to see me very naked"
1908120,1911520," We accidentally well I didn't but Yvonne"
1912000,1918180," Accidentally sent him footage where one of the cameras in our house was firing into our bedroom"
1918180,1921460," It's not in the bedroom, but it could see in and I was walking around"
1921460,1924980," you know dongers out nice nice and"
1924980,1929300," Yeah, isn't this like the second time third apparently"
1929300,1935940," Third time that Dennis has had to see me naked but at this point with how much time you spend sneaking around in my house"
1935940,1939840," You know looking at my surveillance really to blame here. Yeah"
1941100,1944600," Actual victim yeah, I don't think it's Dennis. Yeah"
1944600,1948100," Anyway ubiquity"
1948100,1953800," Great cameras no ongoing no ongoing subscription fees or anything like that"
1953800,1958740," The G4 dome is protected with an IPX 4 rated weatherproof enclosure"
1958740,1962560," With IK08 rated vandal resistance"
1962560,1968920," So it's great for monitoring highly populated areas and venues and it offers 4 megapixel 24 fps video with a built-in microphone"
1968920,1974820," And is powered by power over ethernet you can use the link in the description to check out the ubiquity store today"
1974820,1982720," Did you switch to your screen there for a second no okay interesting we had some echo oh weird"
1982720,1984720," I don't know if it's still happening or not"
1984720,1987740," But well I will definitely mute this just in case"
1987740,1990480," sweet"
1990480,1996600," Do we talk about overkill computer is the audio fixed let's talk about overkill computers"
1997600,1999720," Thanks"
1999720,2003160," Thanks cool all right overkill computers after discussing the"
2003160,2006760," OC which I guess is overkill computers"
2006760,2012480," Controversy last week they reached out to us which is cool and we decided to hear their side of the story"
2012480,2019120," So we're gonna go through different things that were brought up like the cease and desist the I'm not threatening you comment the six"
2019120,2023320," Months wait thing the pricing the NDA all this kind of stuff we're gonna go through them section by section"
2023320,2026280," So starting off with the cease and desist this was"
2026280,2034120," Apparently issued as a last resort after Lucas the owner/founder tried to reach out personally to circuit board"
2034120,2039320," Once a few videos were up. It was a standard approach for dialogue basically"
2039320,2044600," And this is I'm reading this off the sheet. I don't know if we got like screenshots of this or what"
2044600,2050040," But standard approach for dialogue basically in quotes. I think we should chat wins good for you"
2050600,2053640," Read receipts were on apparently was read three times"
2053640,2059520," But was not responded to the the cease and desist was issued after circuit board put out nine videos"
2059520,2068440," Arguably defaming the company in the videos and in the comments again as we kind of talked about last time"
2068440,2073280," At least what we saw I didn't dive into this myself"
2073280,2076080," But at least what we saw while we were live on the show"
2076440,2082360," It was just pointing out that prices were bad, but there was nine videos. We didn't see all of them"
2082360,2084720," So maybe there was other stuff. I don't know"
2084720,2089040," Do overkill computers was getting frustrated"
2089040,2096040," By by some of the comments some specifically talking about how one of their staff who's quite young"
2096040,2102200," They they pointed out and made fun of the amount of thermal paste that they were using but it's just a 14 year old"
2102880,2108040," So like going after a 14 year old on the internet is you know not great"
2108040,2111440," But criticizing a company that builds computers for money"
2111440,2116840," Yeah, that is improperly using thermal based so it's like you're kind of I don't know interesting situation"
2116840,2122400," We were sent the full cease and desist we have it locally. It looks pretty boilerplate pretty standard"
2122400,2128480," Jumping to the next topic the quote unquote. I'm not threatening you in the slightest, which is obviously BS"
2129560,2132160," Apparently the the wife of one of the employees"
2132160,2137920," Started defending overkill computers on Instagram and she was then insulted the"
2137920,2139680," employee"
2139680,2141680," Then made these comments"
2141680,2149440," And they admit it was in poor taste and they admit that it was a mistake to engage in that behavior, which it absolutely was"
2149440,2154280," Also, you shouldn't like"
2155760,2161400," insult someone who's trying to defend their like husband's company on Instagram like leave them alone, but both sides"
2161400,2164160," the six month wait apparently during"
2164160,2172240," COVID all 70 plus customers were told upfront that there was a I'm assuming this is people 70 plus people that were affected by the"
2172240,2175920," Six-month wait, I guess so I guess so because I'm sure they have more customers than that"
2175920,2183480," I mean, maybe not also that maybe not but during COVID all 70 plus customers were told upfront that there was a big weight ahead of"
2183920,2185920," Big way to head as all parts were getting sourced"
2185920,2192680," Apparently only a few customers then wanted to cancel and get their money back probably because if you were shopping for a computer at that time"
2192680,2194800," You were waiting anyways"
2194800,2199000," So it was basically you have someone else do the waiting for you or you wait"
2199000,2204880," Jumping into pricing the website is bad and outdated and they're in the process of updating it"
2204880,2210400," Hence the old 11th gen Intel stuff. So they're going through a website overhaul that makes sense"
2210880,2214320," If you make an order they confirm with you over the phone or by email"
2214320,2222240," What your parts list is the parts are acquired once an order comes in a big part of the price has to do with paying for customer support when things break in"
2222240,2227440," Shipping company overhead in general work. Yeah, that's the cost of things from companies"
2227440,2231520," I don't think we need to list all that there's a one-year parts and warranty on all builds"
2231520,2236640," That was a confusing part people multiple people were trying to tell me that there wasn't a warranty"
2237280,2240960," But I checked on their website and they stated there was a warranty right"
2240960,2242960," Yeah, and now they're stating that there is a warranty"
2242960,2249560," So I don't know where that confusion is from because they actually laid out pretty clearly sure and they're reiterating here that it exists"
2249560,2251560," So like I'm not really sure"
2251560,2255760," Like who started that but yeah, they they have a parts and labor warranty on all builds"
2255760,2262800," Some of the more expensive builds like project unknown can involve artists painting intricate designs on the cases"
2262800,2264800," Sometimes taking 20 to 40 hours of work"
2266880,2271840," And copy of terms and agreement purchases are here apparently we have a document for that as well"
2271840,2278240," The NDA thing that we heard about that we both somewhat dismissed. Yeah, I mean, it's normal to have an NDA"
2278240,2284600," Yeah, any company will have an employee NDA like it's just their stuff. You can't talk about it's that simple"
2284600,2289760," Yeah, they said that they might not work with embargoed hardware often or even really ever"
2289760,2295600," So that's not really it, but they they record most of their builds and put that out on content as social media"
2296240,2299840," So it makes sense when the content is put out"
2299840,2304560," I'm not really sure what that means, but having an NDA as an employer makes sense. So I don't really care"
2304560,2310600," And then the discussion topic is interesting but unrelated so I don't know if this makes me"
2310600,2316760," Well, you can talk about it, but not like right now. I don't know if this makes me on their side"
2316760,2320400," They still obviously did"
2320960,2328520," Stuff wrong. Yeah, I appreciate the like the I'm not threatening you in the slightest thing was honestly something that stood out to me a lot"
2328520,2333880," Particularly cringe it was super cringe. I appreciate that they just"
2333880,2340200," Pretty straight up were like that was done in poor taste. Yeah, and it was a mistake to do that"
2340200,2345520," I've said dumb stuff on social media. So have I 100% yeah, so like like real bad"
2345520,2348400," It's it's"
2348400,2353200," Yeah, yeah, so like it happens. I appreciate bad mood like it's yeah"
2353200,2357040," Well, and someone was going after this person's wife. Yeah, which like you know what?"
2357040,2359840," Yeah, I get it"
2359840,2362600," So I don't know it doesn't make me on their side"
2362600,2369080," But I'm a little bit more understanding now. I appreciate the apology. I appreciate the relatively quick apology to I'll say that as well"
2369080,2373680," It's not like they sat on this like not to drag Will Smith under the mud"
2373680,2377160," But these sat on this for like months before making a party. That's weird"
2377880,2383520," This was this was I don't know when this conversation happened, but we talked about this last week like this was a quick turnaround, right?"
2383520,2388840," Yeah, so I appreciate that. I don't know all the details behind this so the whole nine videos thing"
2388840,2390840," I don't know if there was stuff in there that was"
2390840,2393560," genuinely like"
2393560,2396760," Libel or whatever. Yeah"
2396760,2400920," Pointing out the the price discrepancy thing though is fair"
2400920,2406640," So if that's all that it was I don't know that's that's all it was but if that is all that it was then"
2406960,2408960," I don't really agree with the cease and desist"
2408960,2412880," But yeah"
2412880,2416200," I'm happy they apologized. I'm happy that they're"
2416200,2423200," Seemingly not trying to artesian bills themselves. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that was that was pretty rough"
2423200,2429120," Rockman 05 line is say bad things on social media and never yeah"
2429120,2435840," Well, that happens from time to time this happen apparently Will Smith apologized long ago and there's a bow man"
2435840,2438800," Now chats just talking about talking about the slap"
2438800,2446320," But apparently not to Chris Rock. So I don't know. I don't know. Yeah, it wasn't this one more like I don't even wash it"
2446320,2450440," I'm not going to be completely honest because I really honestly don't care. I shouldn't even brought it up"
2450440,2456040," But anyways, yeah, that's the that's the overkill computers thing. I'm happy that they followed up with us"
2456040,2458240," And I'm happy that we brought it to winch again"
2458240,2464600," Let's go ahead and have a look at some of our merch messages here. We've got some curated ones Bell. You got something to read to us"
2465160,2470080," Sure do first one here's from Alex. Obviously we are very pro rights repair"
2470080,2473280," Do we have any plans to do anything for our products in the store?"
2473280,2476280," Maybe schematics or repair guides for the backpack or screwdriver?"
2476280,2479760," I mean for a backpack"
2479760,2484320," If you want to repair it, I think you get out the sewing kit and"
2484320,2488400," Yeah, put a patch on it if it really comes to that I I"
2488400,2495120," Like I don't like what repair guide do you really need? I don't want to be like that about it, but it's a it's a"
2495120,2496440," piece of"
2496440,2502000," Yeah, I don't would you call it backpack clothing? No, right? Well, it's still text. It's made out of fabric"
2502000,2508680," Yeah, it's textile textile product. So you know if you can buy a little patch so it on I mean, yeah if it came to that"
2508680,2511800," As for the pretty danker driver"
2511800,2519240," We've you're not the first person to ask and it's certainly something that we have talked about internally"
2519240,2522040," I think that from our point of view"
2522040,2528840," We I mean our our policy when it comes to defects in our in our products is pretty much no questions asked"
2528840,2531240," as it is"
2531240,2536360," So I have a hard time imagining a situation where you would have a problem with this other than like"
2536360,2541560," That you lost like that that you would require schematics for I guess"
2541560,2547040," I can imagine products that we have talked about privately, but not"
2547040,2551280," publicly that could use something like that. Yes"
2551680,2558160," Now that will be different. We do have products coming that will make a ton of sense to have"
2558160,2564600," Maybe not schematics, but replacement. I don't think semantics would even make any sense, but replacement parts. Yeah for things and stuff"
2564600,2570360," But but the screwdriver like I don't know if you if you like bend the shaft somehow like"
2570360,2577960," You're probably buying a new screen well the thing is if you bend the shaft on this the shaft is is press fit"
2577960,2580940," Yeah with machinery you do not own"
2580940,2583000," And if you do own it well"
2583000,2590080," Then you probably have a shop that you could just turn yourself a new shaft with and put it in then by all means"
2590080,2596140," It'd be my guest right like it's it's a mechanical device where everything is is"
2596140,2601880," Examinable at a macro level like if you wanted to oh, here's a here's a funny story"
2601880,2609260," This actually did not make it into the making of the screwdriver video that we shot this week because we're gearing up for launch"
2609620,2611620," but"
2611620,2618540," Have I told the story on Wanshow before about how the the Chinese factory that we're using now actually"
2618540,2622580," Cloned our product and then sent it to us"
2622580,2628860," What okay apparently I have not told this story. It's a really it's a really funny story"
2628860,2633620," The point that I'm going to be making over the next little bit is that this is a macro product"
2633620,2639220," You can scan it and reproduce it like what like what schematics do you need?"
2639220,2646000," It's not like there are it's not like there are ICs on it that where it's impossible to term to determine what's under the hood and what function"
2646000,2651020," It's performing and where you would need that in order to repair the board, right?"
2651020,2657980," Like it it's metal and plastic right so what happened was we were working with the Taiwanese factory"
2657980,2664700," right that was supposed to produce these things for us like a year and a half ago or whatever however long ago it was maybe a year ago and"
2665620,2673460," As far as we could tell what happened was they were acquired by a large tool manufacturer in order to get around the embargo"
2673460,2677620," Or it's not embargoes, but the tariffs on Chinese made tools"
2677620,2684540," So so this this tool brand stopped producing in China bought a Taiwan based tool"
2684540,2689700," manufacturer the one that was supposed to make our bloody screwdrivers and then naturally stopped prioritizing our"
2689700,2692940," Product because they were miss busy making their own product"
2693420,2695700," There was not good communication around that"
2695700,2699380," I don't know exactly who to blame that on but someone and so our"
2699380,2707620," Project got just stalled and stalled and stalled in the quality of the last sample we got from them was atrocious just unbelievably bad the worst we'd ever seen"
2707620,2713980," We wouldn't have considered working with them at that point even if they we had had the commitment. It was just it was awful"
2713980,2718140," So we pivoted we tried to find another factory to do the work"
2718140,2726300," The good news was that there were a lot of high quality high volume Chinese factories that were looking for work all of a sudden"
2726300,2732220," Right since yeah because of these these embargoes and whatnot because of these tariffs, right? Oh, right?"
2732220,2741020," Yeah, so we found someone really good really high volume really a good quality great reputation and we engaged with them and"
2741020,2746180," It was quite a bit later that we realized that the zinc housing"
2746740,2751260," The mold for it well there were just like a couple of weird like"
2751260,2753340," Issues with it"
2753340,2758060," Right, so we got it and we were like yeah, this works, but it's not the same"
2758060,2766660," And so what we found out had happened was rather than them making a mistake with our schematics we"
2766660,2772860," Somehow got our wires crossed and our drawings were never actually sent to them"
2773860,2776740," What we sent them was example"
2776740,2782020," Proper screwdrivers from earlier on in the sampling process with the Taiwan factory"
2782020,2788140," So we got back these these Chinese ratchets that were"
2788140,2792940," Didn't implement any recent fixes and weren't quite right"
2792940,2801460," Because what they had done was they had never actually gotten the drivers or the the driver's got a screwdriver and they're like oh we can make this from us the customer"
2801700,2808980," And they cloned it and the the wild part is that the clone in a lot of ways was actually better"
2808980,2815180," Than the Taiwan one even though they didn't have the drawings and the turnaround Wow"
2815180,2820860," Unbelievable like they had it back in our hands in like eight days or something like that"
2820860,2825700," So this ended up being a lot cooler than I expected going into this story"
2825700,2828380," I was expecting like doom and gloom. This is actually pretty sweet"
2828380,2831340," So we so the good news is these guys are really good"
2831340,2841500," Is there oh is it I don't know I'm changing nothing so I don't know what to tell you"
2841500,2847260," Yeah"
2847260,2851140," The bad news is that"
2851140,2856420," We ended up burning some cycles on this problem that and"
2857780,2865020," And it did cost us it did cost us some time but everything sorted out now and once we got the actual drawings over to them"
2865020,2867700," They were able to do an amazing job"
2867700,2872500," And the ratchets that we have now are better than what we ever had at any stage"
2872500,2878100," Regardless of you know who did or didn't have any drawings from the Taiwan based factory"
2878100,2886380," This is actually near final and I have a final one in my backpack now I because"
2887220,2891660," Can I say both their names publicly yes AJ and Jonathan are here for the land"
2891660,2897420," And I was kind of showing them around because since since they were here last you know they haven't been here since"
2897420,2899780," LTX"
2899780,2906020," So since they're since they're here last the the grounds as I will describe them now has changed quite a bit"
2906020,2910860," So I was kind of walking them around showing them new stuff and we ran into Kyle and he showed us the production version"
2910860,2913460," So yeah, it's pretty sweet. How do you like it?"
2914180,2919340," It's I actually didn't get to touch it because I needed to get back to working"
2919340,2921180," So I was kind of rushing the tour a little bit"
2921180,2923540," but"
2923540,2930220," I've used previous versions and I was already pretty happy with it. So yeah, I think it would be good. I'm excited nice"
2930220,2933460," Yeah"
2933460,2936340," More more curated messages"
2936340,2940700," Yes"
2940700,2944460," Everyone's asking what happened. I just blame Colton. You know he was here last week"
2944460,2947020," He's not with us anymore though. So don't worry"
2947020,2950660," Perfect way of saying that actually dead"
2950660,2957820," From from a non-linoc. You've obviously put in a lot of new Wi-Fi and the mobile signal booster"
2957820,2960620," If you ever tested or use any radio survey software such as"
2960620,2964740," Ekehau have you ever actually mapped your radio signal?"
2964740,2970220," That's a really good question. I have played around with channelizer back in the day"
2970220,2972500," I was gonna say it a long time ago. Yeah, the Wi-Fi"
2972500,2980620," I actually reached out to Medigeek recently because I'm having some issues at my new place that I think will probably be resolved by"
2980620,2982260," spectrum analysis"
2982260,2987460," If they don't get back to me this looks freaking amazing this looks super cool"
2987460,2994260," Design Valley maintain high-performing Wi-Fi. Yeah, like I we're having issues where in my kitchen"
2994660,3001340," Even if I don't have my microwave on like sometimes a lot of Bluetooth audio cut out from like me to you"
3001340,3003660," Which is wild like my old house"
3003660,3007740," I could go all the way downstairs and have it working and it's not even through the concrete floors"
3007740,3012100," Like I don't get it and then when my microwave is on like everything becomes completely unusable"
3012100,3014740," Those Sony wireless speakers in the living room"
3014740,3018940," Sometimes I get cut out issues with them even though they're not even that far away and they worked fine before"
3018940,3021860," So I really need to figure out what the heck is going on"
3022180,3025020," Bell do you want to note this down because this could be a pretty cool?"
3025020,3028220," Potential partner, right like sometimes that's what happens"
3028220,3033540," We end up doing we end up covering something editorially and then they experience the LTT effects. They're like"
3033540,3038620," Well, we know they're hit at that and we're like yeah, but we already like covered your product"
3038620,3040940," So I guess now you pay and they're like"
3040940,3044980," Okay"
3044980,3047140," It's happened so many times"
3047140,3052020," All right"
3052020,3058380," Adam hey, just want to let you know I saw the Backstreet Boys and I want to let you know how great of a show it was not trying to rub it in"
3058380,3062940," They performed 33 songs. You don't know what you're missing again. I'm not trying to rub it in"
3062940,3065620," Well Adam you can go"
3065620,3071940," This is working. Yeah, you can go yourself. You can go backstreet back yourself. I am going this summer"
3071940,3078020," Yvonne accidentally spoiled the surprise. Oh, but I have a surprise birthday present"
3078020,3081580," And it is is the kind of that I'm finally going to see the Backstreet Boys"
3081580,3085620," Now we have said that we're at least thinking of planning LTX"
3085620,3091180," No, no, no, it's this August. Oh, okay. I'm going in a few weeks. Okay. Yeah, that's cool"
3091180,3094260," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I've so for those of you who are not up to date. I"
3094260,3099900," Had Backstreet Boys tickets twice. I've never seen them live and I loved them when I was a kid, right?"
3099900,3105180," So I was like, oh, I'm sure it's good. I you know, I go season back to boys, right? I had tickets twice and"
3105740,3112620," Then LTX ended up needing to be on exactly the day of the concert that I had tickets for this was twice"
3112620,3118980," Two times. I missed the concert. Yeah, so I'm going I'm going no there will be no emergency LTX this August"
3118980,3128580," From Justin and a few others any updates on the 64 ounce water bottle. Yeah"
3128580,3135260," Well, they're there on the boat, but that takes weeks and then once they are land or once they arrive"
3135740,3138620," They could sit out in the water for weeks"
3138620,3144380," Yeah, and then once they actually come on to land they could sit at a facility for weeks. So I don't know I"
3144380,3150220," Don't know you tell us. Why don't you ask the nightmare that is the global logistics?"
3150220,3153340," system now"
3153340,3156380," Sorry"
3156380,3159220," This next next message is from Dominic"
3159220,3164300," I really like this idea had to buy a new mousepad because I had a second kids to buy by office and big desk"
3164300,3171100," But my 13 year old daughter loves her new 1500 by 600 pad as a bed rug. That's another way to buy it"
3171100,3179900," I'm not gonna say that that's an officially supported use case for the LTT desk pad, but hey"
3179900,3184540," I can't prevent you from doing that just like with right to repair. We're not telling you how to use it"
3184540,3190420," I saw someone else in the merch messages today talking about using them as wall hangings for like noise deadening. I'm like I"
3190420,3193220," We have not measured them"
3193900,3199580," We have no idea what they're their acoustic management capabilities are"
3199580,3202540," That's funny, but hey you do you right?"
3202540,3212660," From Ben do either view like or follow motor racing and specifically the techno technological advancements in categories like formula e"
3212660,3215260," No, I"
3215260,3222100," Just don't have the patience for it. I know if you're super into it. It's deep like"
3222700,3224700," It's all like awesome"
3224700,3228940," And I and I know whoever whoever like bought F1 or whatever"
3228940,3232620," They've apparently been doing a fantastic job with it has been popping off"
3232620,3234620," There's tons of people talking about whatnot, but like I"
3234620,3243340," Don't even watch sports that I like played let alone anything else. So yeah, it's not not for me"
3243340,3247580," Seems cool though. I don't know"
3247580,3249780," from a non"
3249780,3251780," screwdriver holster when"
3251780,3253580," Oh"
3253580,3256100," Okay, we're trying to find a good leather partner"
3256100,3264460," I got some belt samples that I am honestly not that happy with so we're still we're still working on it"
3264460,3269780," I do want to do like a dad Chad. So that'll be driver holster. Oh"
3269780,3272620," the belt whoops"
3272620,3275620," Yes"
3278260,3282980," Is this it are you gonna show it am I still wearing my microphones? Oh, I saw my mic pack"
3282980,3290140," All right one moment, please don't make you close. No, no, I'm good. Oh crap. This one's still rolling"
3290140,3297060," Man, okay. Well, that's a long clip. That's a lot of extra audio and probably a trip to the bathroom or two on there"
3297060,3299220," I had no idea that was still going whoops"
3299220,3301940," nice"
3301940,3304460," Yes, oh"
3304460,3308260," Dead Zone asks do the LTT swim trunks have a mesh lining or is it like board shorts?"
3308260,3312860," They do have a mesh lining your donger will not be showing through the front of your shorts can confirm"
3312860,3318700," Otherwise those would have been some pretty uncomfortable try-on sessions with the ladies and creator warehouse and me"
3318700,3322460," So this is the this is the like prototype belt"
3322460,3324940," my complaints are that the"
3324940,3327300," the like I"
3327300,3330140," Don't know like the finishing material on the top and bottom"
3330140,3335740," I'd rather it's just raw leather so that it still looks like it did when it was new even if it doesn't look as polished"
3335740,3338420," Yeah, this is really thick and bulky"
3338420,3343180," Like this whole part here which makes it so it kind of like sticks out even"
3343180,3348380," Through your shirt and makes it kind of hard to like get this in"
3348380,3354900," I think this is kind of cheesy the LTT on the inside. I don't know what we'll do. Are you planning on a reversible buckle?"
3354900,3357060," No, then why is it two different colors? I?"
3357740,3363900," Got a good question, and this is a little bit too shiny. I think it's a little bit too dressy right now overall"
3363900,3370140," As much as I love the black finish on the metal you can see it's already coming off"
3370140,3372700," So just like the screwdriver shaft these a bunch of work"
3372700,3379660," It just doesn't make sense you just have to go for what's gonna look good in the long term versus what looks good in"
3379660,3386380," Product photography. Yeah, that's just that's just part of the the philosophy. I think going forward for us"
3386380,3388380," We have echo again"
3388380,3394540," What even can it be well, I'll just not talk for a bit"
3394540,3398740," Does it happen when I'm talking is it both of us?"
3398740,3402180," Only line is though"
3402180,3405060," Do we want to do is there a merch message that I can cover?"
3405060,3407060," Oh"
3432820,3435620," Trying to tie it directly into the backpack"
3435620,3441940," I think I've got a few it's bring extra cables"
3441940,3447500," Bring extra us like figure out what your your main device cable is probably at this point us BC"
3447500,3452660," But figure out what it is if if it is USB C bring some extra USB C cables"
3452660,3459540," I would also recommend bringing some extra cables that aren't what you necessarily use so say you're like a USB C Android"
3459540,3461380," person"
3461380,3464260," Bring some bring some lightning cables as well"
3464260,3467980," Just so that you can aid other people in your travels be the hero"
3467980,3475660," Have extra battery banks that type of stuff use your bag as the like catch all solution for like everything"
3475660,3477900," Usually when I'm traveling I have a couple"
3477900,3479620," Like cliff bars"
3479620,3480540," I don't have to be cliff bars"
3480540,3485100," But some some type of like something that you can eat to sustain yourself just in case you get caught in a bad situation"
3485100,3487020," The second you land"
3487020,3491780," Because you obviously can't take it across the flight with you but as soon as you can when you land acquire water"
3491780,3497940," Store in your bag. Yeah, I'm staying hydrated is huge. It helps with jet lag. It helps with just"
3497940,3504060," Not being well, okay jet lag not being as tired. It helps you just you know keep moving"
3504060,3510420," Hyrations massive and even if you're going on a trip that you think is like really tailored and stuff"
3510420,3513700," You're not at home. So if something happens knowing that you have food"
3514060,3521380," Water and like these other supply battery banks whatnot to keep you keep yourself going very easily without needing to panic and have big"
3521380,3528700," Anxiety and stuff like that is just fantastic. So the question was apparently Bell was muted the question was any travel tips"
3528700,3534060," Stunner L fun twitch asks Jesus guys. Can you like monitor your own stream?"
3534060,3536060," Please? How does the setup constantly break?"
3536060,3539180," The answer is we don't know the computer is cursed"
3539380,3544660," It has ghosts living in it and yes, we are monitoring it and there's no echo in my ears ever"
3544660,3546620," I don't yeah, there's no echo for me"
3546620,3551140," I don't know exactly what happened but due to the how the setup is going right now"
3551140,3556220," I'm pretty sure one of the fins on one of the fan blades for the graphics card like blew off"
3556220,3560380," Yeah, mid like actually broke off and flew out of the computer midway through the show"
3560380,3567380," So they had to somehow stop the GPU fans from spinning and put a big box fan in front of the computer all that happened live"
3567380,3571340," Yeah, well, we were hosting. It's just when show things. Yeah"
3571340,3575780," That's when we were way earlier when we're like do you guys can you guys hear that?"
3575780,3577660," That's because the the computer was going"
3577660,3583020," Because one of the fans was unbalanced because the I actually thought it was in the stream"
3583020,3588260," It sounded like some kind of weird electrical interference or some kind of weird. Yeah, so"
3588260,3596060," Yeah, we're you know working on it actually ghosts raxes over on float plane says don't take shit from twitch"
3596060,3602260," No one cares about them true story true story for twitch or twitch. I don't feel bad"
3602260,3606100," They're losing all their creators now. They made their bed. No one loves them anymore"
3606100,3608900," Time to sleep time to sleep twitch"
3608900,3617420," Next one yeah, yeah from a non now that I'm not muted"
3617420,3619860," Is there anything consumers can do to prevent companies?"
3619860,3625260," I eat Google calling products like stadia and taking away purchases made on or through their product"
3625580,3626780," Nope"
3626780,3631380," Not until there's like huge legislation that's gonna come out. That's it's happened recently with stadia"
3631380,3634980," It's happened recently with with Ubisoft. It's happened recently with Nintendo"
3634980,3639220," There was a there was a"
3639220,3642020," rant on Twitter recently"
3642020,3646500," Talking about physical games and I couldn't agree more if you have the option"
3646500,3653060," I think it's a good idea by a physical game PC games you're screwed because you'll buy like a physical"
3653380,3655380," Case and it'll just be empty"
3655380,3658500," Just be a download code, which is really annoying"
3658500,3661740," But stuff like switch like you know"
3661740,3665760," Nintendo is gonna screw you over on your digital purchase. They have shown"
3665760,3671220," Historical patterns of this forever. They will shut down the store. Yeah that you bought the game on"
3671220,3674220," You won't be able to download it anymore. All these things are gonna happen"
3674220,3681060," If you can buy physical so that you will be able to play that game in the future. I would highly highly recommend it"
3681060,3687140," Because yeah the games you you don't own it they can take it from you at any time"
3687140,3690080," And they can stop giving it to you even though you've purchased it at any time"
3690080,3694580," And even if you like a game if the community didn't dive on top of it super hard"
3694580,3700700," Like whatever that VR title was with Ubisoft. It was only like a couple years old or something"
3700700,3701700," Yeah"
3701700,3708860," What if you bought it and it was still for sale after they announced they were gonna take it offline. Yeah like insane absolutely ridiculous"
3709500,3714980," What about the same issue with digital media for movies music and video yeah?"
3714980,3720180," Yeah, for sure. Yeah, if you want to make sure that you have access to a movie buy them Blu-ray"
3720180,3732940," From Dylan how much of the GPU issues with Intel do you think is caused by executives not really understanding the market if at all?"
3733620,3740980," Well, it's not an executives job necessarily to understand the average gamer for an executive"
3740980,3749500," They work for the shareholders and the shareholders want executives to spend money wisely so that it generates a return on that investment"
3749500,3754900," With that said I think the best executives do understand the product"
3754900,3762460," But they also have to understand that other thing right so the product and the customer right so they also have to understand how to get"
3762860,3765580," Good investment on money because if I'm a shareholder"
3765580,3771420," My options are to invest in Intel so let's say I have a hundred dollars"
3771420,3778820," I want to invest in Intel and I want to get some target. Let's say five five percent of that back each year"
3778820,3781460," That's a pretty like okay"
3781460,3787540," Investment ideally I'd like more but hey, it's certainly better than a GIC right"
3789100,3795900," So I don't really have a choice as an executive particularly like a C suite a top-level executive"
3795900,3799100," If I am not generating an acceptable return for my shareholders"
3799100,3803220," They will sell my stock which will inhibit my ability to borrow money"
3803220,3806980," Which will inhibit my ability to reinvest and basically I'm done"
3806980,3810100," so"
3810100,3816420," It's not they do understand they just understand different things than what you know"
3816420,3824180," You or I might consider to be important to understand and as I said before the best executives will understand both sides of that"
3824180,3826180," Yeah, yeah"
3826180,3830540," Question from Alejandro"
3830540,3833820," Linus would you encourage your kids to continue the LTT legacy?"
3833820,3840260," I would only want them to do it if they wanted to I mean one of the things that I say to you know applicants"
3840260,3841900," interviewees"
3841900,3844620," people internally who do work here is that"
3845620,3847620," enthusiasm is"
3847620,3852420," Infectious and boredom is also infectious if you're not actually passionate about this"
3852420,3855380," You don't actually want to do it if you don't live and breathe it"
3855380,3862780," You are not you're not gonna succeed and I know that I've been I've been accused of being like a like a toxic boss"
3862780,3868260," You know when I talk about how my expectation is that for you to be successful here"
3868260,3872580," You are living eating breathing this stuff outside of work as well"
3873020,3877020," But I don't make the rules guys that that just is what it is"
3877020,3883660," We are in a hyper competitive industry where the people that you are up against the the the young"
3883660,3885380," hungry"
3885380,3887380," scrappy youtubers do"
3887380,3891460," Live this they eat sleep and breathe nothing"
3891460,3895700," But whatever it is that they're making videos about and so at the end of the day"
3895700,3900540," I I do not determine this I'm not actually the boss here you guys are and"
3901100,3904740," You guys are fickle if we do one thing wrong"
3904740,3908900," We see it in the analytics if we do one thing right we see it in the analytics"
3908900,3911660," so"
3911660,3919180," Apparently the echoes back again. I can't fathom this is it something to do with you activating and data disabling your mic possibly"
3919180,3922060," Okay, I don't know"
3922060,3926300," So I would only want them to do it if they really want to"
3927300,3929300," You"
3929300,3938100," Next question here since I am on the twitch stream and can't hear it. I'm assuming you're fine"
3938100,3946060," From stepan I remember Linus talking about his ADHD as a mental health advocate"
3946060,3950780," I'm curious what sort of things you do as a company to ensure good mental health and care for your employees. I"
3950780,3953620," Don't know. I think it's probably better to hear from the employees"
3954460,3962340," Bell Luke any thoughts nothing we brush people's souls. We try to destroy them"
3962340,3970740," No, I we I don't think there's a huge amount you can do other than just try to be accommodating"
3970740,3972740," I"
3972740,3974740," I know"
3974740,3979300," Like in certain situations we've tried to had quiet areas or areas without way too much light"
3979300,3982460," We have the flex time system"
3983020,3987380," So that if people are having like a really stressful period of time for whatever reason"
3987380,3993300," They they have that option that might overheat this probably fine probably not that's"
3993300,3999540," The flex time one is big in my opinion"
3999540,4005580," Because I know in regards to feedback from some of the people that I manage that I've heard is that you know"
4005580,4011720," We don't like the people that you work with don't always necessarily have insight on what's going on in your real life"
4011720,4014540," And if something really intense is happening and you just need some time"
4014540,4016540," It's nice to be able to take some time"
4016540,4020860," Without major questions and it doesn't have to take away from your vacation times. You don't feel like you're like"
4020860,4023860," sacrificing in that way and what not"
4023860,4028780," Yeah, I don't know there's there's there's only so much that you can do"
4028780,4033880," as a company and there's only so much that you can do as a company at our size and I think we I"
4033880,4038020," Would argue that we notably exceed expectations in those realms"
4038660,4043400," But I agree the flex time is huge and we actually get to use it. Yeah, it's a big thing"
4043400,4044720," like I"
4044720,4051160," Obviously I'm a channel manager of a couple different things and I got to take a week and a half off and not have to worry about it and actually"
4051160,4053560," take off and"
4053560,4058180," Being taken care of and being able to have people listen here as well if there's ever any problems which they're"
4058180,4062660," In frequent for me at least it's always very listened especially with Linus who?"
4062660,4067280," Is very busy don't kiss us. He'll personally make time which is very nice"
4067280,4069540," So we have a good team here for sure"
4069540,4073540," Yeah, I mean obviously this is sort of me talking about it"
4073540,4079000," There are other things that we do as well. We have summer fun program, which we actually just recently relaunched"
4079000,4084820," I forget what the exact terms of it are but I think as long as you have five LMG employees"
4084820,4091060," We will cover up to a hundred dollars per employee for you to just go out and do something fun together"
4091060,4093900," and we're pretty"
4094140,4100240," We're pretty liberal in terms of what that thing is so if you just want to like go blow a bunch of money at like"
4100240,4102900," Arcade like we're like, I'm sure"
4102900,4108900," Someone's trying to go to the track and bet on horses. I saw an application for that"
4108900,4111380," I think we're probably gonna reject that that's pretty stupid"
4111380,4112900," but"
4112900,4118100," Don't really want to sport gambling. Yeah. Yeah, that's really not that's really not the point of it"
4118100,4119340," Yeah, yeah"
4119340,4125580," To be I just want to make something clear flex time is separate from the provincially and federally mandated vacation time"
4125580,4130040," So it's it's on top of that and it's something that we rolled out during COVID just to make sure that a"
4130040,4136820," people were able to take time off when they needed it during an extremely stressful time and be that"
4136820,4144900," Anyone who was sick wasn't feeling pressure about losing money to show up at work when they when they really shouldn't be there"
4144900,4148820," Yeah, yeah, there's also the"
4149660,4154900," Spontaneous day of fun. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, you know, you can't really count stuff. That's like a one-time thing"
4154900,4160740," Why not they were asked about things that we've done. Yeah, we we try to we try to just pay fairly"
4160740,4168380," I think that's that's something that can't be can't be understated right like it's all fine and good if we have like summer of fun"
4168380,4172980," You know, yeah, we'll we'll cover you like to go do a team building exercise with your colleagues"
4172980,4177460," It's like yeah, clearly there's something in it for us there, but also just like paying people fairly"
4177460,4184020," I think I think matters a lot compared to a lot of media industries in spite of how competitive we are and in spite of the"
4184020,4190740," Like I said the the scrappy the scrappy up-and-comers that are constantly gunning for us, right?"
4190740,4193980," Like we we still try to work a nine to five schedule"
4193980,4196660," That's really important to me nine to five five days a week"
4196660,4200180," There are exceptions the land that we're running right now is obviously an exception"
4200180,4203700," But for the most part we try to help people maintain a work-life balance"
4203700,4207060," There's there's only so much you can do to help people maintain their mental health at work"
4207060,4210300," You just have to like not be at work sometimes and"
4210300,4216180," Yeah, that's what I was trying to get across earlier like there's there's only so much that we can do can't like"
4216180,4222740," Yeah, yeah, that's another thing too is like just listening right like there's a limit to what you can do other than just listen sometimes"
4222740,4230780," From Tyler always been interested in using an external GPU enclosure with a laptop"
4230780,4235860," Is there a silence oriented enclosure I should be looking at is it even a good idea anymore?"
4235860,4240020," Hmm"
4240020,4244860," Silence oriented enclosure. I don't think they're gonna be silent silent because they all have small form factor power supplies"
4244860,4247260," Which are just not very silent"
4247260,4255300," I know gigabyte is still in that market. I think that there are some more Mac oriented brands that are still in that market"
4255300,4258100," I'd say that you know compared to your laptop"
4258100,4262140," They're probably not any less silent as for whether they're a good idea"
4262140,4268780," Are you sure an RTX 2060 Legion laptop would have thunderbolt - it's got to be thunderbolt 3 if it's a type-c port"
4268780,4271620," It's either thunderbolt 3 or 4. I really doubt it's thunderbolt 2"
4271620,4273940," But is it a good idea anymore?"
4273940,4275620," I mean, it's not the most cost effective thing"
4275620,4280580," But once you've made the investment into the enclosure as long as you get one of the more generic ones"
4280580,4283540," Nothing would prevent you from changing out the graphics card as you go"
4283620,4288300," So it's a one-time cost at the very least and so far it looks like"
4288300,4294740," Thunderbolt is not going to evolve beyond the type-c interface or at least connector. So"
4294740,4298660," Yeah, I mean I'm super into it. I think it's super cool"
4298660,4306860," but the most practical thing and the most cost effective thing is to have a portable laptop and then a powerful desktop"
4306860,4313020," Compared to having like a powerful laptop that you'd been like hook expensive dongles into"
4313100,4314780," Yeah"
4314780,4316780," We're at going again"
4316780,4321160," Yeah, I sent Bell message apparently it's something to do with one of the lower thirds potentially"
4321160,4326740," I don't know that was one theory right now. It's covered, but no, no, it's not the one that we thought it was so"
4326740,4330980," It's a mystery. Yeah, I don't"
4330980,4333880," That would be extremely surprising pretty mild"
4333880,4339180," So I think we'll have to live with it for the next little bit here because we've we're not quite sure what it is. Okay"
4341580,4343580," from"
4343580,4344940," Samuel"
4344940,4349220," Love from comeback love the water bottles. I've seen LMG grow up from the house era"
4349220,4354820," Are you afraid about the possible coming recession effect in the growth of LMG? Yes"
4354820,4362780," Yeah, we've been making a lot of investments lately the timing couldn't be really well it could be a little worse for us but"
4362780,4366460," We're at a somewhat vulnerable"
4366460,4369420," Spot"
4369420,4376380," We're in a yeah, it's not a great time for consumer confidence to be going way down for there to be"
4376380,4380020," just geopolitical conflict around the world and"
4380020,4385340," And then we're expanding and and yeah, we're expanding"
4385340,4391300," You know a big a really important thing to us is making sure that everyone still has placed to live and food to eat"
4391300,4393780," You know taking care of taking care of our own"
4393780,4398300," So nothing's getting cheaper. I guess is what I'm trying to say"
4399300,4404780," Yeah, it's been it's been really really stressful. I think last time you've on and I sat down and looked at it"
4404780,4408940," Over the next 12 months. We're projecting something like maybe"
4408940,4413300," 60% the profit level of what we had the previous 12 months, so it's been pretty heavy"
4413300,4420100," Backpack and screwdriver if they are just smash it and knock it out of the park successes could change that but"
4420100,4423300," You know, I'm not gonna count those eggs before they're hatched"
4424020,4432940," Also timing for stuff like backpack and screwdriver is is rough. They're worth it. They're great products, but they're premium products and"
4432940,4436380," You know premium products"
4436380,4440640," Can get hit by by recessions"
4440640,4446460," To be clear the hyper premium product, you know like your $3,000 pair of shoes or whatever"
4446460,4452700," I said Luke a hilarious article that like hyper cars in the UK are up 17% year over year"
4452860,4454700," Like okay, sure"
4454700,4459060," But it's the it's the premium but not you know that"
4459060,4462380," Tier that tends to get hurt. Yeah"
4462380,4470340," From frost coder always enjoy the Twitter back and forth between Linus and dbrand if you had a dbrand your house"
4470340,4475220," What design would you go with? I'd probably go with a big thing that says dbrand"
4475220,4478860," Yeah, nice those guys nice"
4479140,4487380," Fair yeah, I'm pretty sure the homeowners association wouldn't be super into it"
4487380,4491220," But it'd be there for a little while yeah till I get fined"
4491220,4499100," From a non I've been getting into pricing together in NASA and some of your videos mentioned VMS"
4499100,4503940," What would be the use case for a NASA VM for home users? Well, I couldn't speak from experience here"
4503940,4511180," But you know somewhere to something to use for all your torrenting so that you're not using your daily driver machine is something that"
4511180,4513540," People would use a VM for"
4513540,4521700," Another thing you might use a VM for is running server software that just you don't want to deal with like some command line Linux install"
4521700,4528260," So plex media server for example can easily run in a Windows VM that would sit on your NAS rather than having that running on a"
4528540,4534220," Desktop in your house that might get shut down on a regular basis like a server the expectation is that it's going to be running all the time"
4534220,4539700," It's not a VM but it's a Docker container which is"
4539700,4547340," Kind of related but you know home assistant is running on in a Docker container on my server"
4547340,4552500," So things like my lights and blinds would have their commands run through that particular server"
4552500,4555620," Can you think of anything else?"
4556500,4561260," Know that that that first one, you know, I don't remember exactly the details of what you're saying"
4561260,4563260," But that seems like a really good point the"
4563260,4569020," Yeah, you ever want to just download something sketch and you don't want to do it on like your computer"
4569020,4573860," Even even if you're not worried about the tracking of it if you're worried about it being bad"
4573860,4576700," Just like a virus to be clear using a VM"
4576700,4580580," This is not mean that it's not save you all over your network for sure"
4580660,4586500," But there are not like it doesn't help that do not spread on your network. So that that could be a way"
4586500,4593460," I mean dark containers. Yeah for sure one thing you can do is that you can you can access a VM without it actually"
4593460,4597940," being on the network so you could just disable its network interface and"
4597940,4603100," Execute whatever executable it was and see if it's you know horrible"
4603100,4607700," So as long as you've got it as long as you've got it network gapped"
4608540,4610860," Probably you'll be fine, but not a guarantee as well"
4610860,4616420," It's not something that we would necessarily recommend if you actually want to play around with stuff that you think is like probably malicious"
4616420,4619140," It should be completely air gapped that is to say not"
4619140,4625300," physically connected to your network at all and a VM is sort of inherently connected a little yes"
4625300,4633700," Tom asks if you'd heard of the ODD class action lawsuit if he any thoughts or would be participating"
4635100,4639620," What oh yeah, I did that's pretty funny you can get 20 bucks"
4639620,4643820," because of like price fixing on optical drive media and like the"
4643820,4647540," 2000s or something, but you don't have to provide any proof of purchase because"
4647540,4650900," the class action found that like it"
4650900,4655860," It could reasonably say that anyone who was alive at that time was affected by it"
4655860,4660620," So you just throw it at the end you get 20 bucks sweet. Yeah, so do it. Yeah, thanks"
4660620,4665060," This is in Canada. Sorry. Hi everyone else. Hi"
4666020,4668340," Finally something for us Canadians. Yeah, I know right"
4668340,4671860," Taylor asks it's so cold we win those"
4671860,4676420," Is there a particular channel super fun activity that stands above the rest for you?"
4676420,4680100," Oh, I"
4680100,4685700," Really enjoyed playing like knee hockey upstairs even though I think everyone got horrible rug burns"
4685700,4689300," And I injured my wrist like badly like it hurt for weeks"
4689300,4692260," That was that was pretty fuck"
4692260,4694260," I'm trying to think"
4695260,4700860," In the dark like glow stick fight was pretty fun. It's like hucking glow sticks at each other"
4700860,4706460," I remember we did something where we were like catapulting water balloons at each other. That was like the first one"
4706460,4711540," Was it we hit you right in the junk? Yeah, I'm surprised that stood out as like a good experience"
4711540,4715520," You into that I did not remember that part of it to be fair"
4715520,4723380," I'm trying to think the pranks were really fun the two like big ones. Mm-hmm. Those are really fun. Yeah the the"
4724100,4726100," office theft prank"
4726100,4730740," That one was my revenge was so sweet that one was crazy because"
4730740,4736820," But both of those pranks I was so convinced by I guess partially mine"
4736820,4742100," But mostly I guess everyone else's reactions that I started getting wrapped up even though I knew what was actually happening"
4742100,4745020," I started like you had to like go somewhere. I"
4745020,4747900," Think I think they like disabled your car"
4747900,4751900," So I was gonna like drive you and my brain wasn't like I need to tell them at some point"
4751900,4753900," I was like I'm driving to the airport"
4753900,4757780," And like I remember"
4757780,4760820," When we were pretending that the the office was robbed"
4760820,4766060," Yeah, like people started like running around trying to like see if we could find the person because if I remember correctly"
4766060,4769140," We had someone run out the back door. Yeah. Yeah, and I was like"
4769140,4774700," How is it that you get to play both sides all the time?"
4774700,4781340," About every single prank. Yeah, I don't know actually. That's not fair. I think Luke. No"
4782060,4787700," Nah, yeah, yeah, let's see Luke naked. No plant a bunch of cameras in Luke's house for a change"
4787700,4790780," Ridiculous yeah, that might not be a good great idea"
4790780,4794900," From"
4794900,4796180," Tripp"
4796180,4801500," Hello thoughts on the call me Chris clap after some time now that six hour cut is wild"
4801500,4808780," Yeah, it was a lot of fun on it was funny. It was good watch. Yeah, Chris is one of the most talented"
4809020,4814260," Content creators that I've had the pleasure to work with there are there are certain people that are like, you know"
4814260,4822580," Pretty good, and then there are just absolute professionals like Justine is just such a pro. She crushes it"
4822580,4825300," Chris such a pro"
4825300,4830180," You know, there's I don't know there's there's just there's two kinds of youtubers"
4830180,4833140," They're the ones that there's the ones that are just really passionate"
4833140,4836020," who I think"
4836020,4843060," wouldn't have succeeded in traditional media because they just didn't have"
4843060,4848300," That you know that polish right and that works on YouTube"
4848300,4852300," It's good to be raw, but then there's the ones that could have done it"
4852300,4854980," They they could have just been that that point"
4854980,4858020," 001% of the population that just"
4858020,4863220," Just slay they're just impossible not to like they just turn it on and it's like"
4864180,4870060," Wow, you make that look really easy. I remember when we had Tom Merritt on the Wancher"
4870060,4871420," I was actually gonna yeah"
4871420,4874340," And the guy like much smaller audience than us"
4874340,4881740," For some reason but he basically gave us a lesson on how to host a podcast on our own freakin show right like just"
4881740,4886640," Uproat so you're just after that show both of us sitting back and going like huh?"
4886640,4889180," Yeah"
4889180,4892860," So that's cool"
4893100,4896540," Yeah, Chris Parello was the same the guy was balancing"
4896540,4904700," Talking about the topics interacting with us and interacting with the chat and was doing all three of them better than I could do one"
4904700,4906700," And I'm just like"
4906700,4911180," Darn can you just make tech videos again? Yeah, it's like for real Chris. I don't know"
4911180,4914780," He's probably doing these but I don't know probably Star Wars something yeah"
4914780,4918460," Anyway"
4918620,4922780," But yeah Chris is Chris is one of those people just who is an outstanding"
4922780,4929980," Wit she's sharp. She's always ready with something and you can really appreciate that over a long"
4929980,4933580," tedious many hour project"
4933580,4936620," The fact that she is on"
4936620,4944300," So consistently for so long when she's so tired just gives you some idea how talented she is"
4946300,4950700," Also a savage some of her snapbacks were pretty"
4950700,4956940," Yeah, yeah, it was it was to the point where I didn't feel like I had to pull any punches"
4956940,4958140," No, like I'd go at her"
4958140,4963820," I'd go at her as hard as I as I can at that point because I knew that I was just gonna get it back just as bad like"
4963820,4971020," Yeah, it's one of those things where I really I really appreciate a snappy put down like that's that it's it's part of my sense of humor"
4971020,4973020," It's I like you know"
4973660,4975980," Got him, you know like I love it. I love it"
4975980,4979660," And like I'm never I've never serious I want to hurt anybody's feelings"
4979660,4980780," I'm not about that"
4980780,4983260," But I just I do like that style of humor"
4983260,4990220," And so sometimes I will end up in situations where because I appreciate that style of humor"
4990220,4995900," I will just I'll go hard at someone and even if they don't care even if they don't give a f***ing"
4995900,4998380," They're just like I yeah, I think that's funny"
4998380,5001980," But they just like take it they don't dish it back"
5002620,5007260," I I I'll feel bad and then if it ends up on camera, I will look bad"
5007260,5013500," I will look like just a complete monster. So honestly, it's just kind of a mental load off for me"
5013500,5017260," When I'm hanging with someone that is gonna dish it back"
5017260,5021580," As hard or harder because I can just let loose I just like yeah"
5021580,5027420," I'm gonna say whatever the most horrible offensive thing that pops into my mind is because no one's gonna be like oh"
5027420,5029420," Poor Chris, I would have picked him"
5029420,5031820," Because she's gonna be equally evil to me. That's right back"
5032060,5035260," I don't remember what she said, but she said something that was really good"
5035260,5039100," And I saw your reaction and"
5039100,5043420," I think you played for the camera a little bit, but I could tell"
5043420,5048380," From your reaction that the the overwhelming reaction was like damn that was pretty good"
5048380,5052380," But I was like yeah, that was pretty good"
5052380,5060860," That was so funny. I like it. Yeah. Yeah, like I said, it's not gonna hurt my feelings. I don't care"
5060860,5066060," Yeah, yeah, but I appreciate a really snappy put down. I like it"
5066060,5074460," Question from caden do you think certificates like comptia plus are worth it"
5074460,5078460," Neither of us has it"
5078460,5083580," It's kind of an old time thing at this point. I would argue"
5083580,5087260," I think it was much more"
5088460,5092300," viable back in the days of early operating systems and"
5092300,5097260," liquid capacitors less internet less internet. Yeah, like it was"
5097260,5100300," I"
5100300,5106460," Wouldn't bother unless there was a specific place that said they were looking for it and then I would just get it"
5106460,5109020," And that's it"
5109020,5113020," But like honestly if you're applying there and they require it that's like a little weird"
5113020,5116380," There's some people asking if I'm gonna have Chris fix my hair notation already did it"
5116460,5122300," So you can see my uh, hold on. It's not like it's not like done properly or whatever, but like the fade is good"
5122300,5124940," Way better. Yeah, it's fixed up"
5124940,5128540," Tasia was the one who coached Dennis"
5128540,5132540," So I had the pleasure of hanging out with her for an hour and we talked she watched the video"
5132540,5135420," And so we just basically like talked shit about Dennis"
5135420,5139980," Because she's like yeah, I don't know where any of that came from that is not what I showed him"
5139980,5143580," Like I'm watching the video. I'm going along. I'm like what the"
5144060,5147180," F*ck is that when he just starts doing stuff"
5147180,5153580," It's like yeah, that's not how I coached him. I promise. I will give you a competent haircut. I'm like, yeah, I believe you. I'm here"
5153580,5156220," It looks good. Yeah, thanks"
5156220,5158540," From Cole"
5158540,5163180," Linus, how much longer do you think you have to wrap up your new house? What's left in house a pool progress going?"
5163180,5168540," Are you gonna be like that because I asked you yesterday"
5168540,5171180," Why are you gonna be like that Cole?"
5172380,5174860," Cole? Yeah, who said it? Oh, yeah"
5174860,5177740," Rough"
5177740,5182300," I don't know it depends how much I can turn into video content"
5182300,5189820," So one of the things that's going to take just a really long time is getting everything like perfectly cable managed like ordering cables in the right"
5189820,5194300," Langs and getting all the chargers like wall mounted and all that kind of stuff. So we're gonna make that a video"
5194300,5199020," So I've had Harrison working on that for like over a week"
5200860,5206860," It's great. Um, so things like that will accelerate it theoretically the trades are supposed to be back in this week"
5206860,5210460," They showed up only today. So I don't know what happened the other four days"
5210460,5217660," Maybe they'll finish up in the next couple of weeks. Who knows they're supposed to shoot the concrete next week for the pool, but they probably won't so"
5217660,5220620," I don't know"
5220620,5222620," I don't know the backyard's like"
5222620,5225660," Can have exploded actually a dumpster fire. Yep"
5228300,5232300," From sigh so maybe I'd subdurn to my screen. I think it's so"
5232300,5239500," Sorry, it is. I okay. We're good. What was the decision you made when growing lmg that in hindsight was maybe too much risk"
5239500,5242060," Doing it at all"
5242060,5246860," That's it"
5246860,5253820," Yeah, that's the worst part. That was the dumbest thing ever. It was so sketchy at the start. Yeah, it was like you have no idea"
5256380,5258380," All right. Well from Alex"
5258380,5264860," Linus and Luke which wireless earbuds would you recommend Linus were able to find any replacement for the AirPods Pro?"
5264860,5271500," I still rock the AirPods Pros. I have not found a replacement for the excellent active noise cancellation"
5271500,5277740," There is really good active noise cancellation. Sony's is excellent. Sennheiser's is very good. LG's is okay"
5277740,5281500," um, but apples is excellent tier"
5281980,5288540," Uh, the size of the the size of the carrying case like nothing is quite there. LG's is quite strong"
5288540,5295420," Um trying to think who else is in pretty good shape as far as that goes man. It's just like oh so good"
5295420,5297820," Um"
5297820,5301420," Mine mine is close but not the same. I don't like it when they go in your ear"
5301420,5304220," My ears are a little weird and they just push them back out"
5304220,5305660," Um"
5305660,5307980," So I have the just ogee airpods"
5308860,5314140," And even though i'm on android, I like them the most of everything i've tried so yeah, sorry guys it is what it is"
5314140,5320060," Yeah, adam liked the new bare dynamic free bird earbuds that they just released apparently the battery life is"
5320060,5326860," Insane, I think it's 11 hours. Wow. Yeah, so it's he was pretty impressed with those. I have to check those out. Cool"
5326860,5329980," Uh from anon is there a dream"
5329980,5334220," collab anybody that you would love to have on the show or do a video with"
5335420,5340140," I think someone asked this like last week when you weren't here and I basically was like, I don't really watch a lot of youtube"
5340140,5343980," So I don't really know I I like people in general mostly"
5343980,5347180," Okay, I mostly don't like people, but I like youtubers in general"
5347180,5352700," I don't know there's something about youtubers. I just like i'm like, yeah, I all kind of cut from the same cloth"
5352700,5355500," Like I just kind of get along with them automatically. So I"
5355500,5362140," Yeah, it's always fun, but I it's it's hard for me to just get out of my my focus bubbles sometimes"
5362700,5366860," And and think about that and to be clear. I like you people you guys are my tech people"
5366860,5372380," It's just like when I have absolutely nothing in common with someone. I'm just a lot of the a lot of the people that I would say to you"
5372380,5375180," I don't know a lot of people that I would like to collab with the most we already have"
5375180,5378620," Yeah, that's fair"
5378620,5384620," That's it for merch messages. Are we gonna land to go to yeah, let's get out of here. All right later"
5384620,5387820," Bye"
