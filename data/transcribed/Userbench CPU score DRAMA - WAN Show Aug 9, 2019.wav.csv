0,3600," - Welcome to The Wancho."
3600,6360," We are 21 minutes late and Linus isn't even here."
6360,8040," - Well Linus, that's why I relate."
8040,8880," - Yeah."
8880,10040," (laughs)"
10040,13080," I was here on time, James was here many hours before"
13080,13920," on time."
13920,15120," - Trying to figure out whether I was just started"
15120,15960," without him."
15960,17360," I think he's gonna relieve me soon."
17360,19240," - Yeah, they're filming a video like right there."
19240,21560," So us talking is probably gonna be super annoying for them"
21560,23280," but they told us to do it, right?"
23280,24120," - You said do it."
24120,25200," - Not our fault."
25200,26240," Welcome to The Wancho."
26240,27480," We got great topics."
27480,29920," User benchmark controversy, they changed the weights"
29920,33280," of how things are scored and it moves some processes around"
33280,36480," in the ranking system in some funky ways and some people,"
36480,39360," especially the AMD crowd, are very upset about it."
39360,42560," - And Cloud Fair stops servicing 8chan."
42560,44920," - My free speech."
44920,46960," - Oh my God, they're a private company."
46960,51240," Anyways, AMD Epic 7000 and 2 Series Rome processor."
51240,52720," I'm not gonna need to say anymore."
52720,54160," - All that and more."
54160,55000," On the Wancho."
55000,55840," - Roll the intro."
55840,56680," - Roll the intro."
57880,61340," *dramatic gibberish*"
61340,65300," Whatever they call it, all ad sense taken..."
65300,70100," Demonotize for Hampshire dance."
70100,70960," Yeah!"
70960,71940," It's isolate!"
71940,73860," Body, body!"
73860,76760," Hey mate!"
76760,77660," Oh, hey, super face!"
77660,78660," Honey!"
78660,79700," Just fast sun."
79700,80600," Squarespace."
80600,81900," Bye boo!"
81900,83560," And Rijoule."
83560,85040," Rijoule!"
85040,85540," Rijoule?"
85540,87200," Oh, Rijoule!"
88160,89760," AJ is crying right now."
89760,90760," What is it?"
90760,92660," Absolutely bawling at this moment."
92660,100500," Anytime I say anything French, I think the hair and the veins on his body are partially wolverines."
100500,101320," Okay."
101320,105500," Did you know that in America, the Kia Sportage is pronounced like Kia Sportage?"
105500,106760," Really?"
106760,107260," Yes."
107260,109660," Like an ad and stuff?"
109660,111060," Yeah, that's what I heard."
111060,111800," Whoa!"
111800,112660," Sportage."
112660,113660," Interesting."
113660,117020," Speaking of Sportage, Cloudflare terminates."
117020,118020," They did this, right?"
118020,119020," They terminated the..."
119020,121360," Okay, so Cloudflare terminates 8-chan."
121360,123320," That's, I believe..."
123320,126440," I mean, Cloudflare isn't like a server host."
126440,130240," So they probably terminated like DNS setup and all this other kind of stuff so you wouldn't"
130240,131320," be able to get there."
131320,134880," But they didn't like delete the..."
134880,137760," They don't have that type of relationship."
137760,138760," But..."
138760,143040," For all intents and purposes, the website's down until you find a new replacement."
143040,146000," From what I've heard they did and then that's gone now too."
146000,148000," Right, so what happened was they got another..."
148000,149000," Car potato."
149000,153540," They went to a competitor whose name is on here but I'm on the right part of the dock."
153540,154540," Sure."
154540,155540," Epic?"
155540,156540," Yes, and then it was kind of..."
156540,157540," Epic with the K."
157540,160260," That's the most epic, like most epic type of epic."
160260,161260," Absolutely."
161260,166780," Epic in turn though was relying on the services of Vauxility who pulled the plug on Epic after"
166780,173220," it learned that 8-chan had moved to Epic because they had the same philosophy as Cloudflare."
173220,174220," Okay."
174220,177120," So I know you still can't get onto 8-chan."
177120,178120," Okay."
178120,179120," I think."
179120,180120," I'm not going to try right now but..."
180120,186080," I tried earlier and all I got was literally if you just type in 8-chan, all you get is articles"
186080,189280," about how it's about, about like all the recent news about it."
189280,190280," You got good."
190280,191280," Yeah, yeah."
191280,192280," I can't even get it."
192280,193540," It used to be fun when this kind of stuff would happen and you would get like the FBI"
193540,194540," website seized page."
194540,196540," Have you seen those?"
196540,199280," It should just be like a GIF of an FBI guy."
199280,201280," We're taking your website."
201280,204040," What are you doing here?"
204040,205040," Let's see."
205040,209460," Like a guy and like a detective guy."
209460,211060," Yeah, these."
211060,212060," These were epic."
212060,214620," Yeah, those are cool."
214620,215620," Show them."
215620,216620," Yeah."
216620,217620," What do you have?"
217620,218620," I see."
218620,219620," Seizure of mega upload."
219620,224380," It's like so aggressively official looking."
224380,227680," Seized in the background repeated over and over and over again and there's like government"
227680,228680," stamps."
228680,229680," It's like strobing."
229680,230680," Government seizure."
230680,231680," Government seizure."
231680,235880," It's like the purest form of justice porn I think."
235880,236880," We did it guys."
236880,239360," Let's put our stamps and stuff all over it."
239360,240360," It's us."
240360,241360," We took it."
241360,242360," So yeah, okay."
242360,243360," So what happened?"
243360,245920," This is related to a recent tragedy."
245920,246920," Yeah."
246920,250720," Particularly the shooting in El Paso."
250720,251720," So I'll just read it here."
251720,255240," The suspected gunman in the recent El Paso shooting appears to have been inspired by the"
255240,261360," forum website known as 8chan, which is of course related to 4chan but even less moderated."
261360,262360," Unless."
262360,263360," Yeah."
263360,265960," Some people call it infinitechan, infinitychan."
265960,268800," It's basically described as like a blank piece of paper."
268800,270440," You can just write whatever you want there."
270440,271440," Okay."
271440,272920," Anyone can start their own little microblog there."
272920,273920," All right."
273920,274920," Unmoderated."
274920,275920," Okay."
275920,276920," For the most part."
276920,282640," It appears that this gunman posted a 2300 word manifesto to the site just 25 minutes before"
282640,284720," beginning his attack."
284720,286480," That guy is online."
286480,288320," 25 minutes before."
288320,289320," Like."
289320,290320," Well, we'll see."
290320,291320," I like the internet."
291320,292320," Okay."
292320,293320," Okay."
293320,294320," Okay."
294320,298520," Nearly the same thing happened on 8chan before the terror attack in Christchurch, New Zealand."
298520,299520," Oh."
299520,300520," Yes."
300520,305280," So it's I think there's at least three big tragedies linked to 8chan at this point."
305280,306800," That's a that's pretty intense."
306800,307800," Yeah."
307800,312080," The El Paso shooter specifically referenced the Christchurch incident and appears to"
312080,316640," have been inspired by the largely unmoderated discussion on 8chan, which glorified the previous"
316640,317640," massacre."
317640,320160," That's a dark stage of humanity."
320160,324440," If if you have unmoderated conversation, it just turns into that."
324440,327560," I think there's a few different things going on."
327560,332400," I think when populations get significantly large or sufficiently large, there's just"
332400,335120," a minimum percentage of crazy people."
335120,338440," And when there's billions and billions of us and we can all connect with each other as"
338440,341640," long as you speak, you both speak English or you both speak the same language, you can"
341640,342640," find each other."
342640,343640," And everything."
343640,346920," So broadcast it and people won't shut up about their names."
346920,349120," And like they get glorified to a certain degree."
349120,350120," Yeah."
350120,351120," They can find each other."
351120,352120," Yeah."
352120,354120," And when there's just so many people on earth and they can find each other like that, there's"
354120,356880," bound to be a handful of them that congregate in the same space."
356880,360080," And on top of that, I think that there's like people get radicalized."
360080,361080," Yeah."
361080,364800," Like you see this other content and it pushes you into places you haven't been before and"
364800,366520," you actually get worse."
366520,368640," And so it's a there's a feedback loop there."
368640,372120," It's like like riot mentality, but website based."
372120,373120," Yeah."
373120,374560," It's I just I find."
374560,377640," And this has been talked about a million times where people wave wiser and more intelligent"
377640,381640," than me, but it's really, really frustrating with some of this happens and they broadcast"
381640,386640," pictures and their writing and their name and everything because it makes them famous"
386640,387960," within various circles."
387960,392600," Well, on the bright side is I was researching this story today and I still don't know the"
392600,393600," dude's name."
393600,394600," Perfect."
394600,395600," Okay."
395600,396600," So that's cool."
396600,397600," Good."
397600,401040," So what happens was Cloud Trust steps up and they made a big blog post statement saying"
401040,407440," why they they pulled services from this particular website, which is they stress not something"
407440,408440," they want to do."
408440,414200," We have some quotes here saying we reluctantly tolerate content that we find reprehensible."
414200,418920," Like we try to host a lot of companies that we think are bad people in the name of free"
418920,422760," speech and giving platform to as many of voices possible."
422760,425600," But there's a line."
425600,428680," According again, but we draw the line at platforms that have demonstrated."
428680,433000," They directly inspired tragic events and or lawless by design."
433000,435760," Achan has crossed that line."
435760,439240," While removing a Chan from our network takes the heat off of us, it does nothing to address"
439240,441320," why hateful sites fester online."
441320,442320," That's a big thing."
442320,444360," A lot of people are saying, well, like this isn't going to do anything."
444360,446440," The site's just going to go back up online tomorrow."
446440,448640," And if it doesn't, another site like it will."
448640,450600," Well, sites are really hard to squash."
450600,453320," There's a lot of places you can go to stick around."
453320,456800," And yeah, I mean, the people that were on here are still going to be on the internet."
456800,457800," So yeah."
457800,462600," Although I think, I don't know, sometimes when you remove a forum like that, you just have"
462600,463840," to find somewhere else to hang out."
463840,465760," Maybe you de-routicalize a little bit."
465760,466760," Maybe."
466760,471800," But I find it interesting that they're not onioned because like that's not even hard"
471800,472800," anymore."
472800,475600," I paused for a second before I said that because I was like, maybe I should give them the idea."
475600,477120," But it's pretty freakin' obvious."
477120,478120," They're internet people."
478120,480120," Yeah, I think I probably figured it out."
480120,481120," A prime is here."
481120,482120," He must hate something about the show."
482120,485600," I thought he was an enderman for a second."
485600,486600," What's an enderman?"
486600,488600," Is it like those Minecraft hands?"
488600,489600," Yeah."
489600,492280," If you look at them, it's like a problem."
492280,495840," But he just, and he just like stands there and takes things every once in a while."
495840,496840," Man."
496840,497840," And you're like holding something?"
497840,501600," I feel like the fact that I've never really played Minecraft is like a kid never having"
501600,502600," played Lego."
502600,503600," Yeah."
503600,504600," I feel like it's like a, what a shame."
504600,505600," Yeah."
505600,507800," What a shame you never played Minecraft."
507800,510760," And what a tone pivot we just did."
510760,512280," Yeah, absolutely."
512280,513280," Back to the dark stuff."
513280,515280," Okay, so Instagram made a response because..."
515280,522080," Wait, what happened was after the cloud flare thing, the CEO of 8chan made a video."
522080,523480," And it's pretty interesting."
523480,524880," It's really free speechy."
524880,530000," It's really like there's a superimposed Benjamin Franklin like a German background, like a"
530000,532120," wolf t-shirt almost."
532120,536560," And he basically says like, look, we abide by the law."
536560,537720," We're always forthright."
537720,540960," We work with the police like within minutes of these attacks."
540960,542640," Like we're not evil people."
542640,544360," I'm not an extremist."
544360,547360," This is a blank piece of paper that people can use for whatever purposes they do."
547360,550360," And sometimes evil people like this use it in evil ways."
550360,554880," Okay, because that's not free speech doesn't mean as far as I know, literally everything"
554880,557400," because I'm talking about the American one."
557400,558720," This is not my own country's laws."
558720,560320," So I'm not 100% on top of it."
560320,565560," But as far as I know, you can't do like calls for violence and stuff."
565560,569360," So it's not purely a blank piece of paper as far as I know."
569360,571960," Because that's not allowed."
571960,573440," Yeah, there's definitely not..."
573440,575320," You're not allowed to say certain things."
575320,577920," Like free speech to a certain degree."
577920,578920," Yeah."
578920,581680," Yeah, I don't know."
581680,585000," But then there were certain things that he called out as facts."
585000,593200," Like he said that the shooter posted not on the manifesto, not on 8chan first, but indeed"
593200,595360," on Instagram first."
595360,602600," And he then also says that the manifesto was not uploaded by that same user."
602600,603680," The shooter did not upload it."
603680,606200," He may have written it, but a different user uploaded it."
606200,609040," Obviously, if that's true, then it would have been someone working with him."
609040,610040," Yeah."
610040,611040," But..."
611040,615760," And he also says that Cloud Fair has an impending initial public offering and they just want"
615760,618680," like good PR in the lead up to that."
618680,619680," Okay."
619680,623760," Because like, okay, so something to talk about in CloudFlares."
623760,627880," I say this every time something like this happens on Wensho, which is fairly often, is"
627880,629760," CloudFlares completely within their right to do this."
629760,630760," Of course."
630760,631760," Of course."
631760,634600," If they're not a company, they can do whatever the hell they want."
634600,635600," We work with CloudFlare."
635600,640200," They could take full plane and line of sex tips for them off their service if they wanted"
640200,642320," because that's completely within their rights."
642320,648720," So sometimes the free speech argument when you're talking about a company doesn't make"
648720,650680," a ton of sense to me."
650680,655920," You can go after their policies in regards to how they deal with that."
655920,660840," Because like an example that I like to bring up is that the forum does not have anything"
660840,662680," like that at all."
662680,665040," There's no free posting rules on the forum."
665040,666120," It's a tech forum."
666120,670240," We have an off-topic section where you can talk about some stuff, but we usually try"
670240,671960," to stay away from political things."
671960,673440," We try to stay away from whatever."
673440,677960," The reason for that is there's no paid moderators on the forum."
677960,683280," And those kind of topics create a lot of work and they're all volunteers."
683280,685160," That is actually the reason."
685160,689200," It's because we have a bunch of volunteer moderators and when you do that, they can't"
689200,693400," moderate the rest of the forum, which is actually the important parts in my opinion."
693400,694400," Just go somewhere else."
694400,695400," It's a tech forum."
695400,696400," Exactly."
696400,697400," Exactly."
697400,703600," So I like to defend the company's ability to do whatever in that regard because we have"
703600,705680," a similar problem on the forum."
705680,709160," This is obviously a ridiculously different scale."
709160,712600," But I think it is definitely up to the companies to do whatever."
712600,717680," Now, Cloudflow has positioned themselves for a long time as a defender of these types"
717680,719080," of things."
719080,721280," So that's where it starts to get a little bit interesting."
721280,725280," Because Cloudflowers refuse to take down a lot of different websites."
725280,730920," In their own words, they're struggling to create a policy that can be broad and consistent"
730920,732680," and applied again and again."
732680,737920," How do you word that perfectly so that it aligns perfectly with your values across all"
737920,742400," these myriad situations that are just getting crazy and crazier every day, it seems."
742400,744080," How do you make a blanket rule?"
744080,745080," Yeah."
745080,749000," So I can sort of understand the response to a certain degree because they've positioned"
749000,752920," themselves as that entity that will defend whatever."
752920,756280," But then I just want everyone to keep in mind that it is a private company."
756280,757680," It's not the US government."
757680,759200," That law doesn't really apply."
759200,763000," Well, the mission statement is something like to create a better internet."
763000,765200," And the definition better though."
765200,766200," Yeah."
766200,767200," So it depends."
767200,768200," Does that mean free?"
768200,769200," It's really big."
769200,770200," Yeah."
770200,771200," It means safer."
771200,772200," Yeah."
772200,773200," Who knows?"
773200,778440," So after the CEO of HN made that statement, actually Instagram or Facebook responded saying,"
778440,786680," Instagram said that the shooters manifesto wasn't, was not first uploaded to Instagram"
786680,788240," indeed."
788240,792800," They did find an Instagram account that was tied to the gunman and they disabled it,"
792800,795520," but it had been an actor for over a year."
795520,798000," So who knows?"
798000,800920," What does this 8-chan CEO know?"
800920,804040," What is this Facebook PR person telling us?"
804040,805040," Who knows?"
805040,806040," Yeah."
806040,807040," Yeah."
807040,810560," And then we're going to be into like a, no, the crazy guy posted something on your site"
810560,812400," first kind of battle."
812400,813880," That's a little funky."
813880,815960," I don't know."
815960,817680," None of this is good."
817680,821800," But when the Christchurch shooter did this thing, each streamed it, was that not on Instagram"
821800,822800," that he streamed it?"
822800,823800," It was a Facebook, I think."
823800,825960," Well, I don't think it was Twitch."
825960,826960," I'm not sure."
826960,827960," Oh, right."
827960,828960," Yeah."
828960,829960," Good call."
829960,830960," I'm actually not sure."
830960,831960," But I think it was a Facebook owned entity."
831960,832960," I thought it was Facebook itself."
832960,833960," Okay."
833960,834960," Facebook."
834960,835960," I don't know."
835960,836960," But I'm not."
836960,842400," I don't want to have weird ties to, like he called out, subscribed to PewDiePie and he"
842400,846160," did all this stuff, which was like really stupid and didn't make any sense at all."
846160,851920," And there was a bunch of other stuff that it's really interesting how it's kind of the"
851920,858400," reverse of the like NASCAR idea where like when one of these crazy things happen, everyone"
858400,863040," tries to figure out anything that they had any interest in and then applies evil to that."
863040,864040," Yeah."
864040,865040," Speaking of evil."
865040,867040," That was awesome timing."
867040,868040," I would have focused."
868040,870040," And that's the end of that topic anyway."
870040,871040," Yeah."
871040,872040," Perfect."
872040,873640," Because I didn't really want to talk with anymore."
873640,875440," What up, what up, ladies and gentlemen?"
875440,879160," What topic is no fun and no good?"
879160,882280," 8chan taking, or it's a con player taking down 8chan."
882280,883280," Oh, Lordy."
883280,884280," Yeah."
884280,885760," We thought we'd get rid of that before you showed up."
885760,886760," Yeah, that's a complicated topic."
886760,888920," I actually had wanted to talk about that."
888920,889920," Okay."
889920,890920," Throw your input."
890920,894360," Um, because I feel like a broken record on these types of topics."
894360,895360," Oh."
895360,896360," Oh, yeah."
896360,903040," I love bio updates that are completely like, okay, I can postpone it."
903040,904040," Wow."
904040,908000," There's a, there's a countdown on like sure."
908000,910040," Nothing should ever automatically bias update."
910040,911040," Can we just agree on that?"
911040,912040," Yes, we can."
912040,913040," We can."
913040,914040," You know what?"
914040,915040," No, I'm going to play."
915040,916040," I'm going to play."
916040,917040," I'm going to play."
917040,918040," How?"
918040,922240," Because in my video from Paul, and he said one of the highest shame things to do is have"
922240,927640," your computer, because you power goes out while it's, while it's files updated."
927640,933360," In the event, remember, this is a device in this case, which has a built in UPS effectively."
933360,934360," Okay."
934360,935360," So, so there's that."
935360,936360," That does help."
936360,938440," They do have one safeguard in place."
938440,939440," This is really not going well."
939440,940440," You can wait a minute."
940440,941440," Never mind."
941440,942440," It went away."
942440,943440," There's an error."
943440,944440," There's an error."
944440,945440," Like unrecognizable error."
945440,946440," Okay."
946440,947440," Okay."
947440,948440," Okay."
948440,949440," Okay."
949440,950440," Oh."
950440,951440," Oh."
951440,953960," It's hard for me to do this, but I'm going to, I'm defending this behavior right now."
953960,954960," Okay."
954960,955960," I'm playing devil's advocate here."
955960,956960," Okay."
956960,957960," Okay."
957960,958960," I don't know."
958960,960400," Just just just just just hold on for a second here."
960400,961400," Okay."
961400,965560," There's some kind of horrendous CPU security exploit."
965560,966560," Okay."
966560,968880," The only mitigation is like a microcode update."
968880,969880," Okay."
969880,971320," Your computer's BIOS."
971320,972320," It should, it should update."
972320,973320," It should like make you."
973320,975720," I don't think it should automatically happen on a timer."
975720,977920," No, I don't really disagree with you."
977920,978920," Okay."
978920,983520," I think it should tell you and be like, yo, you should like really do this."
983520,985200," Um, but yeah, I don't think- Okay."
985200,987320," So on the stuff- What if your battery's low?"
987320,989200," Well, you think it would check."
989200,990920," Like the BIOS can read the battery percentage."
990920,994480," Are you sure that did?"
994480,995480," Maybe."
995480,997480," It looked too sophisticated."
997480,998480," Okay."
998480,999480," So hold on a second."
999480,1001520," Let's talk about, let's talk about the whole-"
1001520,1002720," HN thing that went down."
1002720,1007320," So my main take on this, so there's a couple of things."
1007320,1013120," I am pro-free speech, but here's the thing."
1013120,1020920," That a lot of the people upset about CloudFlare blocking HN seem to have overlooked."
1020920,1022320," Free speech- I mean, okay."
1022320,1027760," There's a number of ways that free speech gets misunderstood by the average person."
1027760,1028760," Way number one."
1028760,1033000," Free speech is protection from government persecution."
1033000,1040400," Not the right to just say anything you want to anyone you want with no ill effects."
1040400,1043040," That is not what free speech means."
1043040,1049000," So the other thing too is the general concept of your rights ending where someone else's"
1049000,1050480," begins."
1050480,1057560," CloudFlare is a private enterprise exercising their- very similar to free speech."
1057560,1061640," Like there's a lot of things that are not technically speech that get protected by free"
1061640,1069480," speech, but they are effectively exercising their free speech rights to not deal with"
1069480,1073120," or have any association with HN."
1073120,1076800," Point number three that seems to get misunderstood by a lot of people."
1076800,1081200," The United States of America is not actually the world."
1081200,1085720," I didn't bring up that one."
1085720,1087400," I did bring up your previous point."
1087400,1089000," That's usually one of your favorites."
1089000,1090000," Yeah, I know it is."
1090000,1095040," I brought up the private entity thing, but I didn't bring up the Americas and to actually"
1095040,1096040," the entire world."
1096040,1097040," Oh, okay."
1097040,1098040," I don't know."
1098040,1101880," That one just, I get such a kick out of that one because I always get these messages"
1101880,1103840," whenever I'm in another time zone."
1103840,1106560," Why are you uploading at three in the morning?"
1106560,1111640," Because East Coast USA is just one of believe it or not more than 24 time zones."
1111640,1114400," There are a lot of time zones out there."
1114400,1115400," It's amazing."
1115400,1116400," You'd be floored."
1116400,1118840," You'd be floored by how many time zones there are."
1118840,1119840," All right."
1119840,1120920," So we can go ahead."
1120920,1123120," We can move on to the next topic."
1123120,1124960," Why is this not, why is this doing this?"
1124960,1128920," How many times do I have to load my browser to the perpetual Wancho document?"
1128920,1129920," Okay."
1129920,1130920," So I think."
1130920,1131920," What have you guys talked about so far?"
1131920,1132920," Just the A-chan thing."
1132920,1133920," That's it?"
1133920,1135600," I think we should do the user benchmarking because it's in the title."
1135600,1136600," Okay."
1136600,1137600," Let's do that."
1137600,1138600," I got you."
1138600,1140520," The user bench controversy."
1140520,1145440," So we were actually supposed to talk about this when we did Wancho Live at LTX."
1145440,1146440," Oh."
1146440,1147440," Yeah."
1147440,1149040," It was one of our highlighted topics."
1149040,1150680," We were like going to talk about it."
1150680,1154080," And then people got mad at me because they were like, you guys are covering up for Intel"
1154080,1155080," again."
1155080,1158280," And I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa, chill, chill for a second."
1158280,1161160," We got all wrapped up like giving away cool stuff to the audience."
1161160,1164800," Like we were just like having a good time and actually didn't cover a ton of topics."
1164800,1166520," For some reference, you know, not at all."
1166520,1170200," For some reference of how much I've completely forgot this, I'm the one that decided it was"
1170200,1171760," our headliner topic."
1171760,1174880," And I got him to pose for it and everything."
1174880,1177280," And I had, I don't think I'd ever seen this before."
1177280,1180600," So the only reason I brought this up was because I saw a couple of comments that people were"
1180600,1183600," like, hey, you guys said you were going to talk about this."
1183600,1185280," I was like, yeah, we did actually have game."
1185280,1186280," We should do that."
1186280,1189600," I hope you called it out as your color topics because I don't remember this literally at"
1189600,1190600," all."
1190600,1193120," So user benchmark or user bench or whatever it's called."
1193120,1194120," Yeah."
1194120,1197320," User bench, which I have actually never heard of."
1197320,1199400," Should I have heard of user benchmark?"
1199400,1202800," Uh, let me go make."
1202800,1204720," Uh, okay."
1204720,1207200," I have maybe I've heard of it at some point."
1207200,1213960," But user benchmark has never actually been part of our benchmarking suite."
1213960,1215840," You're sharing screen sharing, by the way, right now."
1215840,1219920," It's never been part of our benchmarking suite here at Linus Media Group."
1219920,1220920," Yeah, I know."
1220920,1222920," I have never run it out of idle curiosity."
1222920,1225000," So I thought it was something else."
1225000,1226400," No, I've never seen this either."
1226400,1227400," Okay."
1227400,1228400," Cool."
1228400,1233120," So anyway, apparently they get millions of website traffic every month."
1233120,1234120," So that's cool."
1234120,1237400," Apparently they recently adjusted their score weighting mechanism."
1237400,1243040," So previously they weighed single core performance as 40% of the score."
1243040,1245360," Quad core as or quad threaded."
1245360,1246520," Did it jump back real quick?"
1246520,1247520," Jump back to your screen."
1247520,1248520," Sure."
1248520,1254560," Quad threaded performance as 50% of your score and multi core performance as 10% of your"
1254560,1255560," score."
1255560,1256560," I have fixed it now."
1256560,1260960," So you can see on their scoring things, they have percentage values, user rating percentage"
1260960,1263120," values, single core, multi core."
1263120,1265880," I don't actually see the quad core thing, which is the highest weighted one."
1265880,1267640," So not sure, but don't worry about it."
1267640,1270240," But they have everything like set on the top here."
1270240,1271240," Okay."
1271240,1277240," So they came out and they were like, however, due to unrealistic scores of many core CPUs,"
1277240,1283120," like Ryzen 3000 series, user bench changed their weighting system as follows."
1283120,1290080," 40% single core, 58% quad core and only 2% multi core."
1290080,1295760," So previously it was 40% single core, 50% quad core and 10% multi core."
1295760,1297680," So they dropped the multi core by a lot."
1297680,1298680," All right."
1298680,1304280," So this riled up AMD fans who want to see their team's processor at the top of the chart."
1304280,1310920," And you guys shouldn't be fans of microprocessor manufacturers because I'm, I'm a let you know,"
1310920,1312520," I'm a little secret."
1312520,1313520," Okay."
1313520,1316440," They don't care about you."
1316440,1317440," What?"
1317440,1319000," I know."
1319000,1321000," They care about their shareholders."
1321000,1323760," Oh, I'm sorry."
1323760,1325600," It hurts my feelings."
1325600,1328400," I appreciate their damage now."
1328400,1333440," Anyway, so this riled up the people who are fans of AMD."
1333440,1339560," And to be clear, I'm not down on being excited about competition in the marketplace."
1339560,1340720," I'm excited about that."
1340720,1341720," Yes."
1341720,1342720," But I'm not a fan of AMD."
1342720,1346280," I'm not a fan of Intel because at the end of the day, business is business."
1346280,1348000," And that's all it is."
1348000,1349000," Okay."
1349000,1355800," So this riled up AMD fans who are fans for whatever reason because the $120 quad core core"
1355800,1358000," I three, 8100 now beats."
1358000,1359180," Oh, wait, no, sorry."
1359180,1360960," This is a point of clarification."
1360960,1366040," So here's the thing though, AMD processors were not the only ones negatively affected"
1366040,1368920," in terms of their perceived value by these changes."
1368920,1376920," So the $120 quad core core, 3, 8100 now actually beats in tells $2,000, 18 core core, I nine"
1376920,1382360," ADX, and the rankings because of its higher boost frequency."
1382360,1385480," So user benchmark has hundreds of thousands of benchmarks, emissions and it's data based"
1385480,1388400," it influence the purchasing decisions of nearly 10 million visitors each month."
1388400,1391240," Wow, this sounds like an ad for user benchmark, which I've never heard of."
1391240,1396600," No, following the July 2019 cohort, we noticed the CPU gaming and desktop indices were overestimating"
1396600,1398000," all CPUs with core counts beyond eight."
1398000,1399000," So we updated that index."
1399000,1402680," So this is basically them sort of clarifying why this was done."
1402680,1403680," You know what?"
1403680,1409320," I understand why AMD fans are mad because you know, their thread ripper CPUs now don't"
1409320,1410320," look as good."
1410320,1415160," But the thing that people have to understand is that while I don't necessarily agree on"
1415160,1419400," 2% as the right number for workloads that will take advantage of a thread ripper for"
1419400,1421560," the average user."
1421560,1425760," It's definitely less than 10% yeah."
1425760,1427240," So."
1427240,1437360," And like from the wording that I've seen it literally says it's geared towards gamers."
1437360,1439800," They say that in the text on their website."
1439800,1443680," So I think user I think what they could do is a couple of things."
1443680,1449600," They could improve the system by either updating it frequently because if the idea is that"
1449600,1452680," they want to wait."
1452680,1459040," They want to wait the workloads that are likely in the present day more heavily."
1459040,1460560," That makes total sense."
1460560,1463320," That absolutely makes sense."
1463320,1466920," Or what they could do is they could allow you to run it a couple of different ways."
1466920,1473160," So you could you could run it in like today mode or you could run it in forward looking"
1473160,1475880," mode or like a software gets more multi threaded."
1475880,1476880," I'm going to care more about that."
1476880,1478600," I want to buy a future more more."
1478600,1480040," I hate the F word, but a more future."
1480040,1481600," Future proof processor."
1481600,1486160," Yeah, no, I like one of the things that I like about that concept is just you could even"
1486160,1490800," check pick the future one knowing that you have some use cases now that could use multi"
1490800,1491800," core more."
1491800,1495120," And just be like, I am a future man."
1495120,1496560," Future man."
1496560,1499280," But like it's I like the idea of being able to mess with it."
1499280,1502920," So you could go like, OK, multi core is this percentage important to me."
1502920,1504560," Caught core is this percentage important to me."
1504560,1506120," Single core is this percentage."
1506120,1508720," Some of the problems there are some people are going to recognize how important single"
1508720,1513400," core is due to a whole bunch of reasons and other various things."
1513400,1516880," But yeah, I mean, it's interesting."
1516880,1518840," I do agree with multi core being down."
1518840,1523360," I again, and I but I don't know about the 2% about 2% that seems pretty low."
1523360,1528240," On the other hand, and like if they're looking at it going, yeah, you know, an upcoming 32"
1528240,1531160," core thread ripper or wait, there's a 32 core now, isn't there?"
1531160,1532160," Yeah."
1532160,1535640," So an upcoming like 64 core thread ripper or something like that for the average user's"
1535640,1544720," workload, no is not going to perform 80% better in far cry five or whatever."
1544720,1545880," That will field five."
1545880,1552200," It's not it's not actually materially faster in workloads that most average users are going"
1552200,1553200," to be running."
1553200,1554200," Yeah."
1554200,1556040," No, I will restart later computer."
1556040,1557040," Wow."
1557040,1558040," It's really annoying."
1558040,1559040," You know, it could be kind of fun."
1559040,1560040," Yeah."
1560040,1561040," Benchmarking."
1561040,1565240," Not that this news matters enough to necessarily do this, but having a video where you benchmark"
1565240,1571160," the I 9 99 80 X E versus the I 3 8100."
1571160,1577000," Just go like how does like done that video that exact video."
1577000,1582960," Not quite, but I think we did $100 CPU versus $1,000 CPU."
1582960,1583960," Okay."
1583960,1589120," So close, but we're talking 120 versus two grand, but similar."
1589120,1591080," Um, it's similar."
1591080,1595200," Let me see if I don't remember exactly what we oh no, we did as a $600 CPU."
1595200,1597880," 10 times more powerful than a $60 one."
1597880,1598880," That's pretty cool."
1598880,1600040," People hated that video."
1600040,1601040," Why?"
1601040,1602240," They were just mad."
1602240,1603400," I don't know why they were mad."
1603400,1607360," Yeah, it has a lot of dis like a 10% dislike ratio."
1607360,1609320," I don't I don't get it."
1609320,1612120," What were people mad about mad about?"
1612120,1616160," Um, oh, some people were mad because I kept calling it a core."
1616160,1618240," I said them because this is back when core."
1618240,1622360," I know it's like that was a hard vocal shift."
1622360,1624400," I don't blame you team."
1624400,1628440," Is a $600 line is more powerful than a $60 loop."
1628440,1632600," What are these comments?"
1632600,1633800," Title is click bait."
1633800,1635640," $64 instead of 60 reported."
1635640,1636640," Oh, good."
1636640,1637640," Oh, right."
1637640,1638640," Um, okay."
1638640,1639640," You know what?"
1639640,1640640," Piano banana."
1640640,1641640," Let's answer your question."
1641640,1646120," I'm watching every video from you for years and have an important question you never answered."
1646120,1649160," What should I do when I want to share my mouse and keyboard between multiple computers"
1649160,1650160," at once?"
1650160,1651160," Wait, are they just joking about?"
1651160,1652160," They must have had like a spot."
1652160,1653160," It's got to be an ad spot."
1653160,1654160," It has to be an ad spot."
1654160,1655160," It's a sponsored spot."
1655160,1656160," Oh, sorry."
1656160,1657160," But yes."
1657160,1658160," Spawn."
1658160,1659160," There was a sponsor spot for synergy."
1659160,1660160," Yes."
1660160,1661160," Very, very funny."
1661160,1662160," There was a lot of synergy."
1662160,1663160," Very funny."
1663160,1664160," Yeah, it's a sponsor spot."
1664160,1665160," Yes."
1665160,1666160," Ah."
1666160,1669600," We don't do ads online as tech tips because ads might compete with Google's ad formats."
1669600,1670600," Right."
1670600,1672120," That's why we only do sponsor spots."
1672120,1673960," I am so sorry, Google."
1673960,1675920," I apologize."
1675920,1679080," I will take whatever punishment you seem."
1679080,1680080," Yeah."
1680080,1683160," Go sacrifice a marshmallow to our overlords."
1683160,1684160," Yeah."
1684160,1689040," Or a piece of pie or an Oreo."
1689040,1690600," You can sacrifice them into your tummy."
1690600,1691600," That's perfectly acceptable."
1691600,1693520," So it's actually good for everyone."
1693520,1694520," That's nice."
1694520,1697000," It's a good experience overall."
1697000,1701920," Speaking of things that are good in your tummy, our sponsor for today's video, Honey."
1701920,1705320," Honey is good for your tummy and your web browser because it'll help you save money."
1705320,1710520," Honey is a free shopping tool that finds the best promo codes wherever you shop online"
1710520,1712320," on places that you might have never heard of."
1712320,1713920," They're really small websites."
1713920,1717760," Amazon, eBay, Newegg, Razer, Best Buy, Walmart."
1717760,1719040," I think I've heard of one."
1719040,1720640," Really obscure, really obscure."
1720640,1721640," Yeah."
1721640,1722640," Yeah."
1722640,1727840," Walmart, I was like reading this like, this like, uh, listicle about like the weirdest"
1727840,1729000," things that happened in the store."
1729000,1732920," I'm pretty sure it was Walmart and there was, there were some crazy people in that store."
1732920,1734280," I can tell you that."
1734280,1738120," So those of you who downloaded Honey from our link have saved over $100,000 in the past"
1738120,1739120," few months."
1739120,1742160," Honey gets a small commission from sites where Honey saves you money."
1742160,1743160," It's free to use."
1743160,1747720," It installs in just two clicks and actually a ton of people here at Linus Media Group have"
1747720,1750000," used Honey and saved money."
1750000,1752680," So get it for free at joinhoney.com/linus."
1752680,1756880," Um, and I guess, yeah, that was pretty much the point."
1756880,1764360," Um, yeah, Honey is the sponsor that has been spamming everyone with a spot with a lot"
1764360,1765360," on YouTube."
1765360,1766360," My only."
1766360,1767360," Okay."
1767360,1768360," Yeah."
1768360,1769360," So we've followed up on that."
1769360,1770360," Okay."
1770360,1771360," Um, so this is awkward."
1771360,1773460," I put back the regular lower third."
1773460,1775280," So we have talked to him about that."
1775280,1776280," Okay."
1776280,1779000," And I think what we're going to do is we're going to do a spot for them."
1779000,1780000," Okay."
1780000,1783600," Looks and feels more like like a pre, pre roll add on YouTube."
1783600,1784600," That's the biggest problem."
1784600,1786600," It was terrible."
1786600,1789440," I've just been clicking like a Linus Tech Tips video."
1789440,1793600," Oh, and I'm like, I didn't click Wancho because this is like a bunch of Wancho spots."
1793600,1795040," I'll get like a tech link spot."
1795040,1797280," And I'm like, what do you even, what are you looking at?"
1797280,1798280," Okay."
1798280,1799280," Not even that."
1799280,1800680," I think that's one of the nights that I just like literally didn't sleep the night before."
1800680,1802840," There's something crazy was happening at Flowplane."
1802840,1805440," I look so haggard in that video."
1805440,1807280," Oh my goodness."
1807280,1808280," I watched it."
1808280,1809280," I was just like, oh no."
1809280,1810280," Oh no."
1810280,1812080," I'm happy they're focusing on Linus and they cut to me."
1812080,1814080," I'm like, no stop."
1814080,1815080," Please."
1815080,1818080," That should be fixed by Monday."
1818080,1819080," Okay."
1819080,1820080," Yeah."
1820080,1821080," I don't actually care."
1821080,1822080," Um, yeah."
1822080,1823080," Uh, the Wancho has also brought you by Squarespace."
1823080,1824080," Do you need to create a beautiful website without the hassle?"
1824080,1825080," We'll check out Squarespace."

1839000,1842400," or you can contact their support 24/7 via live chat and email."
1842400,1844840," If you already have a third party domain, you don't have to give it out."
1844840,1845840," Just transfer it over to Squarespace."
1845840,1851000," Plus, you get e-commerce features to help you sell merch or services online and easily"

1853680,1859480," So go to squarespace.com/wann to get 10% off your first purchase."
1859480,1862960," Finally, the Wanchos brought you by Ridge Wallet."
1862960,1866880," With a Ridge Wallet, you can stop carrying around pointless items in your pocket like"
1866880,1867880," receipts or wait, are these your cards?"
1867880,1870880," I've put some cards in there that aren't a problem to be on camera."
1870880,1872880," Oh, that was a good idea."
1872880,1873880," Yeah."
1873880,1874880," Okay, cool."
1874880,1881080," Uh, so having a thin wallet like this encourages you to stop carrying around random bull crap."
1881080,1885080," Uh, it's got two metal plates that are bound by a strong elastic band."
1885080,1890080," So it keeps your cards in securely, but you can also pop them out easily just like that."
1890080,1892080," And they are RFID blocking."
1892080,1895080," So you don't have to worry about skimmers grabbing your card info."
1895080,1896080," They offer a lifetime guarantee."
1896080,1902480," They have a money clip on the side, but in a pinch, you could also store your Ridge Wallet"
1902480,1904480," on your belt, just saying."
1904480,1905480," Just saying."
1905480,1906680," Might want to be careful about where you do that."
1906680,1907680," Yeah, yeah."
1907680,1910680," And they come in different types of metal like aluminum, carbon fiber and titanium, one"
1910680,1912560," of which is not necessarily metal."
1912560,1918080," Use offer code LTT July to save 10% at Ridge Wallet dot com slash LTT."
1918080,1924280," Now I want to move into what is actually the main topic of today's WAN show."
1924280,1925640," Okay."
1925640,1928400," So there have been some epic battles."
1928400,1932320," Uh, you've been so excited about this on YouTube over the years."
1932320,1933320," Some epic battles."
1933320,1935280," Oh, one epic battle."
1935280,1940200," Oh, no, we're going that one epic battle was between."
1940200,1944000," The epic rap battles characters Bill Gates and Steve Jobs."
1944000,1947320," That truly was a spectacular episode of epic battles."
1947320,1953040," More importantly, there was the epic battle between T series and the one and only Felix"
1953040,1954040," Kielberg."
1954040,1955840," That doesn't matter."
1955840,1956840," PewDiePie."
1956840,1957840," Okay."
1957840,1958840," PewDiePie."
1958840,1960360," You know, for top, top subscribe channel now."
1960360,1961360," Key Elberg."
1961360,1962360," I like it."
1962360,1963960," We're not, we're not in a position."
1963960,1969720," We're not in a position to battle over the top most subscribed did YouTube channel of"
1969720,1970720," all time."
1970720,1971720," Yeah."
1971720,1978520," But there is a rivalry that has actually been heating up over the last little while."
1978520,1983600," And so I just want to take this opportunity to say it."
1983600,1986080," Um, Marquez."
1986080,1988080," MKBHD."
1988080,1992200," Oh, I choose you."
1992200,1998080," Consider yourself called out because now people who creep YouTube stats might know this"
1998080,2001240," already, but most of you probably don't."
2001240,2005440," Marquez actually, what, four years ago?"
2005440,2012680," Five years ago, I think skyrocketed past Linus Tech Tips for most subscribed tech channel."
2012680,2015800," Then Lou actually blew past both of us, but we're not talking about that."
2015800,2020440," This is a race for the silver medal."
2020440,2022120," Second English speaking."
2022120,2023120," Okay."
2023120,2024120," Technical Guruji."
2024120,2025120," Technically over 10 million subscribers."
2025120,2032480," Second English speaking tech YouTube channel across the 10 million subscriber mark."
2032480,2037480," Marquez consider yourself called out because, and I'm sure you noticed this man, we actually"
2037480,2041920," passed you for subscribers about what was it about six months ago, Brendan?"
2041920,2043720," Is that son of a right?"
2043720,2044720," Okay."
2044720,2051000," Now with that said, the race is going to be super interesting because Marquez actually"
2051000,2054800," passed us again about two or three weeks ago."
2054800,2057400," But then check this out."
2057400,2062680," So he's gaining an average of around 4,800 subscribers a day."
2062680,2064200," Yeah, yeah, that was a note 10 launch."
2064200,2065200," Okay, okay."
2065200,2066200," Yeah."
2066200,2071640," So he can be very spiky, but he's gained an average of about 4,800 subscribers a month"
2071640,2075240," and he's sitting at 9.054 million."
2075240,2078200," Now by comparison, the Linus Tech Tips channel."
2078200,2079800," 4,800 subscribers a day."
2079800,2080800," A day."
2080800,2081800," Sorry, a day."
2081800,2082800," It's like 140 a month."
2082800,2085160," The Linus Tech Tips channel is a little behind."
2085160,2090600," We're actually about 80,000 subscribers behind, but that is not an insurmountable difference"
2090600,2095840," when you look at our daily average, which is about 5,500."
2095840,2097560," So we can win this fight."
2097560,2099240," Also one thing, a little bit of hot fire."
2099240,2101240," He's a B plus rated your A minus."
2101240,2104480," So yeah, so social blade, social blade knows what's up right there."
2104480,2105480," A minus you like that?"
2105480,2106480," You like that?"
2106480,2107480," A minus right there?"
2107480,2108480," Heck yeah."
2108480,2109480," It's green."
2109480,2110480," His is yellow."
2110480,2111480," Just saying."
2111480,2112480," Marquez."
2112480,2113480," It's on."
2113480,2114480," It's on."
2114480,2115480," It's on."
2115480,2122520," So I'm challenging Marquez to be the next one, the next tech channel to 10 million before"
2122520,2123520," us."
2123520,2129680," And I'm challenging you, our community, to help me out here, please."
2129680,2134440," Because we've been watching it internally."
2134440,2138000," Like it's something that I don't think I've met a YouTuber."
2138000,2141920," They might deny it in public, but I don't think I've met a YouTuber who doesn't creep"
2141920,2144240," other YouTubers on social blade."
2144240,2152120," We all use social blade to like, hey, how are other people in the space doing?"
2152120,2153120," Yeah."
2153120,2154120," It makes sense."
2154120,2158600," So we talk about it internally, but now it's public."
2158600,2163920," So I really need you guys to help me out because I am now officially out of the closet"
2163920,2167400," when it comes to my YouTube stat watching habit."
2167400,2170480," And I would like very much to not be embarrassed."
2170480,2175800," So guys, share Linus Tech Tips with your friends and family, preferably the ones that will"
2175800,2180120," actually watch because it can actually affect us negatively if people subscribe and then"
2180120,2181120," don't watch."
2181120,2184920," It makes YouTube think that like people subscribe and don't like the channel because the content"
2184920,2185920," sucks."
2185920,2190280," So like, find someone who's actually techy and make sure they subscribe."
2190280,2195200," If all 7,000 of you do that today, then we can at least keep pace with him over the last"
2195200,2199840," couple of days because he's had a nice little bump from the Note 10 that I had not anticipated"
2199840,2205120," necessarily before conceiving of the idea of challenging him on the Wancho today."
2205120,2210360," You should pull a Mr. Beast and buy out all the billboards in an area, but just to troll"
2210360,2213760," really hard, buy them all out in his area."
2213760,2216440," So hold on a second."
2216440,2220960," So don't say anything because we have some plans."
2220960,2225600," And I don't want you to accidentally say anything that we actually have planned and"
2225600,2226600," ruin it."
2226600,2227600," Okay."
2227600,2228600," Okay."
2228600,2229600," So we'll talk offline."
2229600,2230600," Sounds good."
2230600,2231600," But yeah, we're okay."
2231600,2235400," Tell you what, tell you what, I can't tell you guys this unfortunately because it would"
2235400,2237200," really, it would really ruin a thing."
2237200,2243560," But I'm going to tell Luke and you get to judge by his reaction how funny this is."
2243560,2244560," Dot picks up really."
2244560,2245560," Okay."
2245560,2246560," I'll be very quiet."
2246560,2247560," Okay."
2247560,2248560," I'll be very quiet."
2248560,2255560," Okay."
2255560,2264480," I haven't even told you the funny part yet."
2264480,2267200," Okay."
2267200,2271200," Okay."
2271200,2278440," So that's how it's going to be."
2278440,2279440," Okay."
2279440,2280440," Okay."
2280440,2283440," And then hold on."
2283440,2284440," Okay."
2284440,2285440," Okay."
2285440,2286440," Okay."
2286440,2287440," Okay."
2287440,2288440," Okay."
2288440,2289440," Okay."
2289440,2290440," Okay."
2290440,2291440," I'm sorry."
2291440,2299440," This is going to be amazing."
2299440,2300440," Okay."
2300440,2301440," Okay."
2301440,2302440," Okay."
2302440,2303440," Sorry."
2303440,2307440," So anyway, I guess I choose you."
2307440,2308440," Okay."
2308440,2310000," Bring it on."
2310000,2311680," That's all I have to say about that."
2311680,2312680," Oh, God."
2312680,2318800," In response with anything anywhere near that amazing, this is going to be absolutely fantastic."
2318800,2320800," Officially best tech feud of all time."
2320800,2321800," Wow."
2321800,2327840," Because the tech feud between AMD and Intel is officially over."
2327840,2331640," Intel is just not really participating in the feud anymore."
2331640,2332640," It seems."
2332640,2333640," Oh, wait."
2333640,2334960," I didn't mean to actually share my screen there."
2334960,2336040," That doesn't matter."
2336040,2341920," The original article here is from our bud, Patrick Kennedy over at serve the home.com."
2341920,2344280," And his headline pretty much says it all."
2344280,2350600," AMD EPIC 7,002 series Rome delivers a knock out."
2350600,2354120," So if in the consumer space, whoops."
2354120,2361680," So if in the consumer space, AMD got competitive with Intel and managed to pull out ahead"
2361680,2365360," in given workloads, particularly multi threaded workloads."
2365360,2370400," Because when we talk about AMD being great for gaming with rise in third gen, we're talking"
2370400,2376680," AMD caught up to Intel and they now like beat them a couple times, but Intel still at"
2376680,2384400," the top end of their stack is the best performing CPU strictly for gaming."
2384400,2392620," When we talk about the server land world place thing in the clouds, those are workloads"
2392620,2401420," that are inherently heavily multi threaded, an area that AMD has cemented a firm grasp"
2401420,2405940," on when it comes to performance leadership."
2405940,2409820," And this is bad."
2409820,2413860," So remember that video I made a little while back where I talked about how I can't hold"
2413860,2419940," tech stock because it would be a significant conflict of interest."
2419940,2424420," If I didn't feel that that was too much of a conflict of interest, here's the thing."
2424420,2433080," I make my money through ads and sponsorships and merch sales and all kinds of different"
2433080,2435340," ways."
2435340,2440700," So the way that I look at it is like looking, I can't have my hand in every honey jar."
2440700,2446820," So playing tech stocks is going to be a honey jar that I just cannot ethically participate"
2446820,2447820," in."
2447820,2451340," But I need to be comfortable with that because I have all these other ways that I make a"
2451340,2452500," very good living."
2452500,2454260," I'm not complaining at all."
2454260,2455340," So I'm just going to be like, you know what?"
2455340,2456900," I'm not going to do that."
2456900,2462620," But if I had had the opportunity, I legitimately, even though I don't actually participate in"
2462620,2466980," stock trading, I would have bought so much AMD that day."
2466980,2474140," And honestly, it was not because desktop Ryzen was like going to be competitive or whatever."
2474140,2475620," That was what the word on the street was."
2475620,2480860," That was what AMD was broadcasting, shouting from every rooftop that they could."
2480860,2489140," The thing that I was actually excited about was this."
2489140,2491540," That is the epic announcement."
2491540,2492540," Wow."
2492540,2493540," Okay."
2493540,2497460," So when we go back to when was Computex?"
2497460,2498460," Like sometime in June?"
2498460,2499460," Okay."
2499460,2500820," So Computex is like what mid June?"
2500820,2501820," Oh yeah."
2501820,2503060," No, this is the spike, right?"
2503060,2504060," Yeah."
2504060,2505060," Early June."
2505060,2506780," So it's actually pretty similar."
2506780,2510140," This kind of downward trend and stuff."
2510140,2512420," This stuff can be all over the place."
2512420,2519460," But you got to remember, when you're buying a stock based on the quality of the product"
2519460,2521860," portfolio, right?"
2521860,2527380," And the competitive position of the other players in the same market, we're not talking"
2527380,2533420," about holding something for a month or two and going, okay, that was my gains."
2533420,2540660," I cash out and like you flip it and buy something else because the thing is for an actual competitive"
2540660,2544820," advantage, not just like, oh, there's a rumor of a buyout or a murder, blah, blah, blah,"
2544820,2549140," like that kind of stuff that really causes stocks to spike and decline or like large"
2549140,2554700," shareholders dumping to artificially deflated and then buying in low or whatever."
2554700,2557420," Like, like there's all kinds of things that can affect a stock."
2557420,2562340," If you want to capitalize on something real, like the actual position in the market of"
2562340,2565740," the company, you need to take a longer position."
2565740,2574260," And what I had an inkling of at that time was that over the next couple of years, AMD"
2574260,2579420," was going to win back significant market share in a space, not gamers."
2579420,2582340," Guys, there's no margin in gaming chips."
2582340,2584820," Like there's a little bit, but come on."
2584820,2586860," Not gaming chips."
2586860,2589180," I'm talking the big stuff."
2589180,2598300," I'm talking $7,000 CPUs of which to go in one blade server of which there are four per"
2598300,2607580," freaking like, like server of which there are like, you know, 16 or 18 per freaking cabinet"
2607580,2611500," of which there are a hundred in a data center."
2611500,2613660," That's the big business."
2613660,2615500," That's the big money."
2615500,2619900," That's where AMD is going to be coming back in their next quarterly earnings report."
2619900,2623900," Maybe not even the next one because after you launch a product like this, it takes a"
2623900,2629460," while for those big requests for quotes to come in or I think it's actually short for"
2629460,2630460," a press for quantity."
2630460,2632060," I think it can go either way, whatever."
2632060,2634940," That's where those RFQs come in."
2634940,2642220," And you know, you look at it, you put together a quotation, the buyers take it, they talk"
2642220,2644060," to their upper management, blah, blah, blah."
2644060,2645060," There's a whole process."
2645060,2648540," Validation, but it's going to, yeah, it's going to take a quarter or two, maybe even"
2648540,2654980," three, but that's where AMD's quarterly earnings at some point in the next year are going to"
2654980,2658540," look like this."
2658540,2660300," That's where it's going to spike hardcore."
2660300,2662300," And that's where I was looking at it going."
2662300,2663980," That's why I would want to take a position."
2663980,2666820," Now heed my warning."
2666820,2672340," Since I said that, since I made that video, AMD has already spiked significantly and"
2672340,2679020," I am not in a position where I am advising anyone to buy or sell stocks, that is not my"
2679020,2680020," job."
2680020,2681540," I am not an analyst."
2681540,2686260," Remember, no matter how good things look, stuff could go wrong."
2686260,2692900," Dr. Sue could die of how excited she is about how amazing her company is performing right"
2692900,2693900," now."
2693900,2695660," Or a fab could have a problem."
2695660,2697740," TSMC could explode."
2697740,2699780," Okay, that could actually happen."
2699780,2701180," China could get really upset."
2701180,2702180," Yeah."
2702180,2705020," Remember when, what was it, floods in Thailand?"
2705020,2709860," Well, with that said, WD and Seagate stock actually spiked because of that because they"
2709860,2711540," just sold hard drives for more margin."
2711540,2713740," Anyway, that's a whole other thing."
2713740,2715340," But something I've been, yeah."
2715340,2717140," The point is stuff can go wrong."
2717140,2722500," I am guaranteeing nothing, but this was what I was actually amped about, but couldn't really"
2722500,2725900," talk about because I had nothing concrete to go on at that time."
2725900,2729020," Zen 2 is a free king beast."
2729020,2733060," I wish I had my swear button so I could bleep myself because I wanted to use a different"
2733060,2734060," word."
2734060,2735060," Okay."
2735060,2736060," So Epic 7,000."
2736060,2737540," Can you show your doc for a sec?"
2737540,2738540," I can."
2738540,2739540," Who wrote this?"
2739540,2740540," James."
2740540,2741540," Why?"
2741540,2745820," We need to do like a word count thing for how many times AMD and Epic were typed in this."
2745820,2748780," Well, AMD is having a pretty epic run here."
2748780,2751260," It's a bit every single life."
2751260,2752260," AMD Epic."
2752260,2753260," The AMD Epic."
2753260,2754260," The AMD Epic."
2754260,2755260," AMD."
2755260,2756260," Pretty much."
2756260,2758220," You should read through Patrick's article because it's great."
2758220,2762420," Pretty much almost across the board."
2762420,2767100," Except at the very low end, Epic is just, I mean, it's just crushing it."
2767100,2771100," I mean, for a single socket, we're talking 128 PCI Express lanes versus what is it?"
2771100,2773220," It's either 46 or 56."
2773220,2774740," Something stupid like that."
2774740,2776580," Like over double the PCI Express lane count."
2776580,2782300," When we're talking big data and machine learning and stuff like that, a lot of the processing"
2782300,2784460," isn't done on the CPU anymore."
2784460,2785900," It's done on GPUs."
2785900,2788540," So this, these, or not even GPUs."
2788540,2790300," I mean, there's other specialized processors."
2790300,2792300," Intel just released their FPGA thing."
2792300,2793300," Yeah."
2793300,2794300," Yeah."
2794300,2795300," Intel themselves seems to know this."
2795300,2796300," Okay."
2796300,2798420," And then aside from that, you need massive storage."
2798420,2800020," You need PCI Express for that."
2800020,2802100," Everything is PCI Express now."
2802100,2803420," They've got way more memory bandwidth."
2803420,2807380," They actually run at faster memory speeds, DDR4 3200 versus 2933."
2807380,2810340," And they've got two more channels per chip."
2810340,2814500," They completely re-architected the way that the memory actually connects to the CPU."
2814500,2819700," And this is really cool because I was actually doing a video on Intel Skulltrail the other"
2819700,2820700," week."
2820700,2821700," Okay."
2821700,2822700," Number Skulltrail."
2822700,2823700," Yeah."
2823700,2824700," Okay."
2824700,2825700," That was Intel's dual socket gaming enthusiast platforms."
2825700,2829500," It was eight cores at a time when nothing had eight cores."
2829500,2830500," Nope."
2830500,2832340," In the consumer space anyway."
2832340,2836020," And I was blown away because I pulled up task manager and I noticed that it only had"
2836020,2837020," one Numa domain."
2837020,2842340," And I was like, oh my God, it had a Northbridge."
2842340,2848580," So the CPU's, the CPU bones connected to the Northbridge bone over the front side bus and"
2848580,2853980," the Northbridge bone connected to the, the FB dim memory bone."
2853980,2859380," So there's no latency penalty for this CPU to grab data from RAM that's connected to"
2859380,2863900," this CPU's integrated memory controller because there is no integrated memory controller."
2863900,2864900," Okay."
2864900,2870340," But integrated memory controller is still has a benefit over that archaic architecture because"
2870340,2875220," basically having a Northbridge means everybody gets a latency hit instead of only when you"
2875220,2877660," have to cross into another domain."
2877660,2890500," Now with Epic second gen, AMD actually architected effectively a more Northbridge like system"
2890500,2895860," with fewer Numa domains except it's all on, it's all on chip."
2895860,2897340," So there, I forget what they call it."
2897340,2900540," It's their IO hub thing that they're building into the thing."
2900540,2903380," They made the IO die, the center of the server, blah, blah, blah."
2903380,2906060," I forget what they actually called the damn thing though."
2906060,2907780," Sorry, you'll have to forgive me."
2907780,2910820," I don't remember what their, what their term is for it."
2910820,2915220," But what this means is that the best case scenario."
2915220,2919580," So just like with the Northbridge, the best case scenario for memory access actually gets"
2919580,2921180," a little bit worse."
2921180,2928340," the worst-case scenario gets way better especially in dual socket configurations. What's that?"
2928340,2933480," I think you still call it Numenodes. No no no the iO hub, the iHub has a name, yeah I forget what it's"
2933480,2937100," called you know what we can probably you know let's give let's give Patrick's article"
2937100,2942260," some shoutouts here it's pretty awesome let's just find it blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah"
2942260,2950460," blah oh Patrick you don't label your pages dude let's move the traditional"
2950460,2955420," northbridge functions blah blah blah etc etc come on you're killing me here dude okay"
2955420,2960720," something something something something I'm dying and these approaches different"
2960720,2967540," integrated server controller hub the SCH I think that's it no that's not it is"
2967540,2971020," that it maybe that's it you know what it doesn't matter I don't care what they"
2971020,2975540," call it the point is the point is they have smoothed out the latency for memory"
2975540,2980460," accesses they have sped up the memory they have more channels they have a 15"
2980460,2985620," percent IPC uplift over first gen epic which is freaking phenomenal they have"
2985620,2992540," up to a 64 core product I mean we are talking Intel's dual socket servers"
2992540,2999180," having a difficult time competing with Andy's single single socket chip and"
2999180,3009260," quick-knoring price AMD 64 core chip the top spec one is like 7700 US dollars a"
3009260,3017060," single Intel 28 core okay single one is 10 grand for their top spec chip now"
3017060,3021180," you're gonna get those at lower prices if you're buying in volume or blah blah"
3021180,3024500," blah whatever but you have to assume that AMD's got discounts on offer to"
3024500,3028140," depending on how much you're buying the point of the matter is just that Intel"
3028140,3033660," is not competitive and then their pricing is out of whack there is basically now"
3033660,3037500," I want to get epic in-house here I want to play with it I want you guys to play"
3037500,3042300," with it for like a video transco server I'm working on it by the way okay so I"
3042300,3048260," want to get epic in-house but as far as I can tell outside of some very specific"
3048260,3054140," use cases like if you must have AVX 512 which is an instruction that AMD has"
3054140,3062460," not implemented yet if you must have it Andy don't got you back but that's about"
3062460,3066780," it I was gonna say for a vast majority of other stuff AMD list prices on"
3066780,3071300," competitive parts are 25 to 35% of what the compute performance would cost to"
3071300,3075980," get from Intel's the own comparables that's Wow compute performance cost not"
3075980,3079460," like chip per chip yeah so that's actually like more important that's"
3079460,3083340," savage it's savage it's savage we're bringing that back it's savage we're"
3083340,3089780," gonna like 2018 yeah exactly yeah savage beating it's like it's hard to watch"
3089780,3094740," you know yeah like like Jake Paul yeah equally hard to watch nice I don't know"
3094740,3099660," I've never watched a jig public it might be great I wouldn't know speaking of"
3099660,3102860," things I wouldn't know I wouldn't know how to get rid of Nick other than to tell"
3102860,3108700," you guys about the hoodie I'm wearing right now oh right really oh it's not"
3108700,3113060," I thought they just took pictures now oh okay this is not on sale yet sorry"
3113060,3118260," Nick what can I do for you did you see the thing that lights at you oh that oh"
3118260,3121740," yeah yeah yeah let's talk about that also did you guys talk about how like there's"
3121740,3125340," a rumor that dr. Sue's going to IBM or whatever what dr. Sue might be going to"
3125340,3128780," IBM well like there's a rumor there's a rumor it doesn't seem very"
3128780,3132540," thing that makes it more legitimate to me is that she directly responded to it"
3132540,3137580," being like this is not true which to me makes it more true she said it's not"
3137580,3145500," true interesting yeah denied a rumor she wants to be IBM's next chief exec"
3145500,3154940," that would be lame how does be a lame move in my opinion we're like maybe IBM"
3154940,3161300," just buys a empty I don't know if IBM could buy AMD and retain the x86 license"
3161300,3164220," though I think that would be the issue yeah there'd be like no value the"
3164220,3167060," licensing around that kind of stuff is yeah and also there would that would be"
3167060,3171260," a significant market consolidation because IBM and AMD actually AMD is poised"
3171260,3174420," that's a really interesting thing too they're also poised with these massive"
3174420,3180660," many core CPUs PCI Express Gen 4 they're poised to take on IBM potentially in"
3180660,3186020," applications where firms wouldn't have to completely re-architect because that's"
3186020,3190420," one of the things that IBM does so well is they focus on the interconnect rather"
3190420,3195780," than focusing on just the performance of their power course so so they're there"
3195780,3199620," like Z series in particular is really designed for like many many transactions"
3199620,3204980," and connect all the friggin things to it and AMD is really taking a very similar"
3204980,3209860," approach with x86 that Intel has largely ignored over the last four years so if"
3209860,3215340," I was dr. Sue I mean I don't know what her executive bonus package looks like or"
3215340,3219180," what IBM could offer her whatever the case may be but if I were dr. Sue and I"
3219180,3223340," were looking to leave a legacy behind I would probably try to make it at AMD"
3223340,3227900," yeah and just kick IBM's ass instead of joining them just for like a"
3227900,3233580," bill and Ted yeah level overview of this it's just boring stay at AMD it's more"
3233580,3237260," fun yeah it's like interesting it has made the industry so much more"
3237260,3242660," exactly stay like I was so it's way more fun I was so bored of CPUs for a bit"
3242660,3255180," yes like everyone was okay yeah yeah yeah so apparently that rumor about dr."
3255180,3260700," Sue being somehow related like your niece or something to Jensen's like second"
3260700,3265900," cousin it's or it's no I thought it was outright false Lisa Sue related to"
3265900,3275540," Jensen Juan here we go that that auto-completed for me technically her"
3275540,3279340," grandfather is Jensen Juan's uncle they're not exactly niece and uncle but"
3279340,3283580," relatives is what this says from 2018 I don't know I had people calling me out"
3283580,3287900," when I was talking about it and they confirmed her grandfather being someone's"
3287900,3293180," uncle that's relatively far to attach second cousin once removed or some crazy"
3293180,3300100," yeah okay I can't find anyone you go far enough back and probably one of them"
3300100,3305540," denied it didn't they 14th cousin 30 second time removed Nick and I are"
3305540,3310020," related yeah all right whatever doesn't matter let's let's move on to"
3310020,3314500," something pretty sick oh apparently our Twitch title is wrong dang it"
3314500,3319380," whatever oh what do you have oh wow okay Nick wants Nick really wants me to do"
3319380,3323420," a merch update okay I'm not that into the suede hat can I show them one of the"
3323420,3329540," other ones for context someone was running one earlier who was it yeah"
3329540,3334220," okay so we're working on a new hat for tech linked it's gonna have like this"
3334220,3337660," little metal thing in the corner and then it's either gonna be like a plane"
3337660,3341500," kind of suede style what do you think of that material it feels quality it"
3341500,3345940," does but I think it's a different kind of personality that wears a suede hat"
3345940,3350140," versus the other one what's up like you can see oh well yeah that's just like"
3350140,3352860," that's a characteristic of suede no but that's what I mean that's one of the"
3352860,3355940," reasons why I probably wouldn't be super into it though yeah one thing that I"
3355940,3359620," have as a completely outside person yeah this is very trendy right now yeah"
3359620,3365340," but I like snapbacks you like snapbacks I'm that guy but this is trendier this is"
3365340,3370260," what people want as far as I know so I like the Heather one oh this is nice"
3370260,3374820," yeah I really like this one and this one actually they look the same but they're"
3374820,3379540," not quite actually oh wait are these ones the same oh oh it's the pin there's"
3379540,3382300," there is another color of Heather that's a little lighter I think the dark one"
3382300,3385860," is the one that I don't normally like gold but against that like the gray"
3385860,3388940," Heather I think it looks pretty good so that's pretty cool that's not actually"
3388940,3392300," the one that I am most amped to talk about right now though so I'm gonna go"
3392300,3397300," ahead and pop out this hangouts window because we are finally working on the"
3397300,3405060," LTT merch that was like Thanos inevitable yes how close are we to this we're"
3405060,3409540," it'll it'll be a while it'll be a while so first should be before holiday first"
3409540,3413460," there's gonna be a mouse pet so we're actually gonna throw this up we're gonna"
3413460,3417860," pull people on this can I oh yes I can't pick a design to tell us what designs"
3417860,3421420," they like best we might do more people by doing pre-orders so we're gonna do"
3421420,3426180," no that's a disaster yeah bad idea so we're probably gonna do a ten key list"
3426180,3430420," on a full-size size okay with like a nice reasonable mousing area like this"
3430420,3436460," kind of yorky okay so we've got kind of your okay so something that we've done"
3436460,3441180," intentionally is left the mousing area mostly blank so that's to make sure that"
3441180,3443740," we don't have any tracking issues introduced by the graphics now most"
3443740,3446820," modern like high-end mice won't have an issue with that but we want everyone to"
3446820,3450620," be able to use them here's a more colorful version it's kind of like winter"
3450620,3455180," slash northern lights kind of inspired like here's just like an LTT circle logo"
3455180,3458020," inspired one I think this one's a little busy personally this is my first time"
3458020,3462620," actually seeing these by the way guys they look like they do kind of look like"
3462620,3467100," dogs I think we're out yeah we're out on the dong we're out on the black and"
3467100,3470820," white dong design and probably the orange dong design - yeah we could just"
3470820,3473900," do something a little bit more abstract like this this is dead on our"
3473900,3479700," yeah here's oh the tech link actually looks really good yeah I like that that"
3479700,3483340," one's that was sharp actually the tech linked branding lends itself really"
3483340,3490500," well to like clean cool designs yeah and yeah I'm gonna throw it all my socks and"
3490500,3497860," by a bunch of these it is inevitable yeah it was going to happen also I don't"
3497860,3504540," know if you guys can see this but yes confirmed we are working on a sandal"
3504540,3507740," okay can I petition I don't know anything about what you guys are doing"
3507740,3512540," yeah it's gonna be a while guys like you'll be wearing these sandals next"
3512540,3517660," summer okay maybe maybe it makes it by then I'm happy everything if everything"
3517660,3521420," goes according to plan you will wear them next summer you guys now need second"
3521420,3525180," layer bottoms so like not underwear bottoms because then if you do that with"
3525180,3530500," this you'll have every so I actually don't want I would be everything I just"
3530500,3534420," killed that project but that would be everything okay here's the I didn't well"
3534420,3537660," yeah I was like you could be a hundred percent okay all right all right all right"
3537660,3542060," chill out for a second here chill out for a second here so pants are really tough"
3542060,3546540," sizing is really challenging not like geez you got it hold on even then you"
3546540,3549900," got to accommodate all the different way sizes all the different leg lengths and"
3549900,3555620," all the combinations thereof okay so there's a huge like front-loaded"
3555620,3559940," investment to bring in all these different sizes that assumes that you"
3559940,3564340," can even figure out you know how to make the clothing fit nicely with all these"
3564340,3569340," different body shapes and types okay pants are hard number two what kind of"
3569340,3574900," pants because jeans basically you're not gonna take on I don't know what a"
3574900,3580740," popular gene brand is Levi sure you're not gonna take on Levi's G star yeah"
3580740,3588100," sure um so jinko jinko whatever the pitch that I got the pitch that I got was"
3588100,3594300," joggers now sinking and sweeping I don't think I did say they're basically very"
3594300,3599860," similar joggers are pretty much trendy sweatpants and the thing is I didn't"
3599860,3608620," actually kill the project so much as I put it on indefinite hiatus because see"
3608620,3613580," the thing is okay so the reason that I put it on indefinite hiatus is that from"
3613580,3619420," a from like a being excited about the merch standpoint I don't wear sweatpants"
3619420,3622940," and I don't wear joggers those are probably closer to joggers than they are"
3622940,3626900," sweatpants honestly the dream hack ones oh yeah yeah they're very jogger-y sweatpants"
3626900,3630780," yeah like they're more fitted and stuff they're not just like I'm sick today"
3630780,3634500," yeah those are those are those are probably basic I would basically I would"
3634500,3639700," basically yeah I would basically want something that isn't I'm sick today pants"
3639700,3645220," but isn't jeans like like okay I don't know fashion so but yeah something you"
3645220,3649980," could wear out but we're not trying to compete with jeans so what's her what's"
3649980,3656420," her name again the the mom of all the the famous Kardashian people a"
3656420,3660620," Christianer so believe it or not it was actually after a presentation from Chris"
3660620,3667460," Jenner of all people where she was talking about how how they decide on"
3667460,3672020," which business opportunities to pursue because okay when you're the Kardashian"
3672020,3676620," slash Jenner clan you have basically an endless supply of people pitching you"
3676620,3681860," on endorsing their product or branding or whatever blah blah blah blah blah blah"
3681860,3687380," and she went one of the most important things for us was to focus on what we're"
3687380,3691140," passionate about because then you will never get bored of it what's up you"
3691140,3695260," don't wear hats I actually don't I actually do wear hats very rarely I used to"
3695260,3698500," wear hats every day okay that's fair so I actually like I can understand the"
3698500,3701620," hat and when I go it on the weekend and I'm like out in the Sun I will I will"
3701620,3704460," take my hat yeah I do wear my own I remember what he used to wear them all"
3704460,3709940," the time so so and besides the hat project was actually already complete"
3709940,3714820," when I attended that workshop so it anyway okay the reason that I killed the"
3714820,3721780," joggers and fast-tracked socks oh no I'm cool I just want to eventually have"
3721780,3727100," more colors of water but Italy eventually happened so what I told Lloyd and Nick"
3727100,3734420," sorry I know that's okay so what I told Nick and Lloyd was we're gonna do it"
3734420,3739340," okay but we're gonna do it after we've explored the things that I'm like really"
3739340,3744780," excited about passion about like I am I don't care if it happens in 2025 I just"
3744780,3749060," want to eventually be able to walk out of the door wearing purely LTT I hate it"
3749060,3753620," when the ice breaks free but the fancy new jacket takes the brunt of the blow"
3753620,3758460," and it wicks right off it does actually this is not actually a jacket though okay"
3758460,3764540," can you get the terminology I'm sorry okay this is the swag it what"
3764540,3772100," SWAT jacket sweater jacket okay okay okay so feel the material here okay okay"
3772100,3777820," kind of like a sweater okay feel the material here definitely jacket it's a"
3777820,3782220," swag it's a sweater between the yeah so you can still get soaked while only"
3782220,3786660," getting a little bit so it's a swag it okay nice and it also has like more more"
3786660,3791700," like out at night features like this is reflective which is actually reflective"
3791700,3798060," strip on front and back that's cool and I will also say it hit the sweater part"
3798060,3801900," of the sweater jacket combo and still wicked off so my joke about getting so"
3801900,3806340," so so it's it's designed to be a little bit shoutier than stealth hoodie yeah it"
3806340,3809140," is a bit more expensive I think it's gonna be about thirty dollars more like"
3809140,3814820," particularly not stealthy but it's YKK zipper the material quality is really"
3814820,3819580," different like it's higher not that stealth is bad just that this cost more"
3819580,3826020," and it retains one of the key features of stealth which is of course the secure"
3826020,3828580," phone pocket I'm just gonna throw in there really quick the material on the"
3828580,3832780," stealth hoodie is actually like particularly nice we've had a complaint"
3832780,3835540," that I don't think it's gonna get soft but breath from you if D tech was like"
3835540,3839020," dude I'm left hand I know I watched the video I don't think there's any solution"
3839020,3844180," to that I mean we could do like a one-off for him but other than that no we"
3844180,3849420," don't plan to do like a lot of free go keep probably free is that possible I"
3849420,3853820," mean anything is that doable like they are actually working on an order of"
3853820,3859500," stealth right now is it possible to what size is you have to medium is"
3859500,3863780," a medium I could see if we could get him a lefty one okay can you see what you"
3863780,3868020," can do all right and we're not doing this for any what guys we're not we are"
3868020,3872500," not doing a left-handed skew because it's it's just another nightmare it's"
3872500,3877180," another inventory item to manage but you can go like this yeah or you can"
3877180,3880740," pass it to your right hand yeah but but it's totally possible you have D has"
3880740,3888420," pimped our merch so hard yeah that just for him we will we will try yeah I'm not"
3888420,3892660," promising anything so anyway we've got a bunch of different sandal designs to"
3892660,3895900," look at some of them are immediately off because anything you can't run in"
3895900,3899820," like this you're done you're done it's out my biggest thing is you have to like"
3899820,3905100," it and want to wear it like a lot so well there are key considerations for"
3905100,3910020," me like I do I do expect even though I'm wearing sandals to be able to run in"
3910020,3914580," them yeah and so it has to be a design that straps for your video where it was"
3914580,3917860," I think it was Taren where you where you had like a battle with him about the"
3917860,3922940," the pros and cons of Sandals vs. shoes I like I know but this sandal needs to"
3922940,3927420," win yes you know what I mean so it has to have everything that is good about a"
3927420,3930740," shoe some of these designs actually look kind of sharp I think that's mainly"
3930740,3935700," just like this one is it well it's not like the sandal stuff is like by accident"
3935700,3938780," and we should absolutely coordinate the sock design with the sandals which is I"
3938780,3942420," think why he provided it this way but some of this is some of this is looking"
3942420,3946100," free I like this one actually I think this looks pretty good so my question"
3946100,3953340," like Chris Jenner stuff is like yeah I have no idea I don't actually pay any"
3953340,3957620," attention to their merch crap so do you know what the kimono is no it's"
3957620,3961100," Spanx with an extra scooping of cultural appropriation I don't know what"
3961100,3966340," Spanx are do you know what Spanx are oh it's like those like why would we know"
3966340,3971460," this crap why do you know this crap like not leggings but like under garments"
3971460,3978940," like tuck all the fat bits in oh okay maybe I should know that"
3980340,3986100," she called it a kimono and then because she's Kim and everyone got upset I"
3986100,3990140," actually give beyond the excellent message that was in part of that talk"
3990140,3994900," about business I give so few cares about the actual content and products over"
3994900,3998020," there I've had a I've had a minor I might be one of the people that buys a"
3998020,4002180," whole bunch of element shirts to expand their clothing because we I had my"
4002180,4006860," dad over last night yeah that was epic I had my dad over last night to look into"
4006860,4009460," a plumbing issue at my house and we figured out that the hot and cold water"
4009460,4012500," is unreliable because when they plumbed the apartment building that I'm in"
4012500,4016060," they run the cold water right next to the hot water oh and it heats up the"
4016060,4019580," other pipe so we've when I've been washing my clothes they've all been"
4019580,4022420," drinking so all my shirts are effectively largest now and they're"
4022420,4026100," supposed to be actualizers so I've like lost weight but look heavier which is"
4026100,4031020," sweet it's really cool so I have the other considerations for the sandal"
4031020,4038940," okay durability I can smell sandals it's okay sandals always fail in the same"
4038940,4045020," spots okay that makes sense here yeah there's just like a lot less stuff"
4045020,4047660," holding on there's a handful of spots that they feel you can see this is"
4047660,4053060," totally detached here yeah yeah so I mean how long have you had that though I"
4053060,4058020," expect a long lifetime out of my sandals yeah no I think this is the"
4058020,4061300," like second or third pair since I've known you know it's probably like number"
4061300,4066540," four okay yeah so I do like one every one and a half years or so it's not bad"
4066540,4069740," it depends on when they fail no I think that's pretty reasonable so if we"
4069740,4073740," can if we can get to that kind of level of quality and remember I wear them"
4073740,4078540," every day like this these are my every day carry"
4078540,4083780," so we did strap weaponized sandals yeah yeah which mouse pads do we like so oh"
4083780,4087180," which mouse pads do we like I can't figure out how to get back to the mouse"
4087180,4091700," pads I can't close this for some reason so I don't know like escape isn't"
4091700,4095340," working I can't oh wait are you guys doing a feedback you guys doing a straw"
4095340,4098340," pull or some other kind of I think they're different I think we're gonna put it"
4098340,4101820," on Twitter yeah no I know they're different files I just I can't close this"
4101820,4106140," I don't know I don't know how to close it oh wait I know what the problem is"
4106140,4112780," it's a separate tab there's you well there's your problem all right so yeah I"
4112780,4117660," don't I don't want to look at that right now I want to look at the socks okay so I"
4117660,4122780," like this one what do you think Luke I like the top left one yeah I like a"
4122780,4126140," little bit of color in my socks personally but what about doing like a"
4126140,4133140," different color we don't have to be married to orange I like orange I like"
4133140,4137500," the like that sock are you guys doing one we don't know yet it's gonna really"
4137500,4142620," depend on minimum order quantities we found a supplier who seems like frickin"
4142620,4148540," legit like they make socks for brands that I've heard of which is cool and like"
4148540,4154860," not Hanes like like brands that make like high-end hiking socks and stuff that I"
4154860,4159860," have heard of and I was like okay cool okay so we found like a really good"
4159860,4165300," factory we think but their minimum order quantities are like 3500 pairs"
4165300,4169700," stuff like that like really really high size or in total like dangerously high"
4169700,4174460," like like per I actually Lordy I don't know because I was talking to John oh"
4174460,4177540," about this before the show and if you guys are vetting as well if you've"
4177540,4181420," vetted for everything else that's on the story so far I'm probably just gonna"
4181420,4185260," throw my socks away and get these and I'm not exaggerate we're gonna do our"
4185260,4190980," best but making like a sock that would satisfy me which is what it has to be"
4190980,4195340," is not gonna be easy and might even take longer than the sandal yeah so but"
4195340,4200140," that's but that is why I'm probably gonna do that so you know the minimum"
4200140,4204180," quantity thing maybe I'm gonna make you start buying merch at some point I"
4204180,4208340," well I know okay I'm gonna have to cuz like I can't just give you your entire"
4208340,4212020," wardrobe for no I know I actually don't want to hear any I was fully expecting"
4212020,4216220," to buy all of that being very clear because the I'm probably gonna do an"
4216220,4221100," underwear swap at one point I've kind of decided that you're not the only one we"
4221100,4224900," have gotten so many orders for specifically like two packs of underwear"
4224900,4228540," which is like nobody orders two packs on their first order yeah that's because"
4228540,4233580," they already have a pack yeah and like three is laundry once a week it's a"
4233580,4238580," buffer yeah it's gone to the point where I get a little bit annoyed when my"
4238580,4242700," LTT underwear are not clean because then I'm like now I have to wear some other"
4242700,4247700," junk I'm just like that sock can't put other junk on your junk no exactly all"
4247700,4254260," right do we have any more topics for today some stuff oh yeah Apple is locking"
4254260,4260260," iPhone batteries to the phone so the original article here is from I fix it"
4260260,4265540," so Apple has announced that only Apple batteries can go in iPhones and furthermore"
4265540,4270620," only Apple may install them RC mail posted this on the forum so if you"
4270620,4274240," replace your battery in the newest iPhone so the 10s the 10s Max and the 10"
4274240,4278420," are a message indicating that you need to service your battery appears in"
4278420,4282500," settings battery next to battery health this service message is normally an"
4282500,4286620," indication that the battery is degraded and needs to be replaced however even"
4286620,4289940," if you put in a brand-new battery a first-party Apple battery you take two"
4289940,4296900," iPhone 10s's and swap their batteries they will both display the error that is"
4296900,4301220," unless an Apple genius or an Apple authorized service provider authenticates"
4301220,4305420," a battery to the phone that phone will never show its battery health and will"
4305420,4309620," always report this vague ominous problem so the way it works is that there's a"
4309620,4313140," Texas Instruments microcontroller on the battery that provides information to"
4313140,4316740," the phone like capacity temperature and how much time until it fully discharges"
4316740,4320540," there's nothing inherently wrong with that and far as I don't know of a phone"
4320540,4323700," that doesn't have that feature I mean Apple's is a little bit custom but like"
4323700,4327660," basically the thing that has changed now is that the chips in the newer iPhone"
4327660,4330900," batteries include an authentication feature that stores the info for"
4330900,4334860," pairing the battery to the iPhone's logic board if the battery doesn't have"
4334860,4339020," the unique authentication key the iPhone's logic board is expecting you'll get the"
4339020,4344700," service message so I wonder yeah if anyone can figure it out and if it would"
4344700,4348940," be even remotely worth it to swap the microcontroller apparently yes that"
4348940,4353340," would work yeah it's extremely difficult but that's what I mean it's more work"
4353340,4359140," than okay yeah because and this is something that is sort of I guess a"
4359140,4365660," saving grace of this move other than giving you that message it doesn't have"
4365660,4369940," an effect so you know how if your battery is degraded past a certain"
4369940,4373660," lifespan Apple can throttle the performance because it can't deliver the"
4373660,4379420," peak power that the phone needs in order to perform its best or whatever"
4379420,4383900," Apple's degraded message here doesn't force the phone into that mode or"
4383900,4390660," anything like that for now hold on it just says degraded and otherwise the"
4390660,4395820," phone operates normally okay the problem as you ruined my transition to"
4395820,4401180," is that this is yet another bloody slippery slope yeah for Apple to lock"
4401180,4406460," down their devices even further so that nobody without Apple's permission is"
4406460,4413020," allowed to open a device and service a device that you own even Tesla is"
4413020,4420540," improving in this regard and like they do not have a good track record no so I"
4420540,4425500," don't really have anything else to say about that like I do I understand Apple's"
4425500,4433260," point to a degree you know every time an iPhone blows up it makes the news Apple"
4433260,4438540," doesn't want that and if they could you know look back at some telemetry data"
4438540,4442820," that shows that that phone was giving a message to their owner that the battery"
4442820,4446980," needs to friggin be serviced and be like well that wasn't the battery we put in"
4446980,4449900," there that would be very nice that would be very nice for them I'm very"
4449900,4454500," conflicted on Apple right now because I kind of really want an iPhone as my"
4454500,4459340," daily driver because it would be very nice for security reasons and the"
4459340,4462180," signing with Apple stuff that's coming and all that kind of stuff is really cool"
4462180,4466380," on the other hand you know how much a battery swap by Apple costs exactly"
4466380,4471700," right yeah so there's like there's the like I really like privacy things and I"
4471700,4477020," really like right to repair and right now they're not going together at all yeah"
4477020,4481460," and that's pretty frustrating that being said how many times have you had a"
4481460,4484460," battery swap and a phone that you actually wall that you're a bad person to ask"
4484460,4489620," for this go ahead ask me how many times if you had a battery swap on a phone"
4489620,4493620," that is your personal daily driver oh yeah no because I know you've had them for"
4493620,4496740," like the security phones and stuff but that doesn't really yeah no no like I've"
4496740,4500180," done phone battery swaps but I changed phones so often you know the note nine"
4500180,4504380," might be my first one based on how the note 10 looks because I'm not upgrading"
4504380,4508820," to it can we do a quick straw poll sure I want to use the new polling service"
4508820,4514020," it's not ready yet sure hit me with that straw poll what do you want to know"
4514020,4519020," Luke what do you want to know she doesn't like you more than once can we"
4519020,4521700," assume that getting a battery swap one time in a phone is not that big of a"
4521700,4526620," deal sure is that fair yeah so have you had your battery swap in your phone more"
4526620,4530740," than once yes or no sure okay"
4535100,4548340," okay yes no and then these types of polls have a tendency for people to only"
4548340,4554420," answer if they're in the upset category so I want you to answer this yeah no"
4554420,4559620," matter what yeah okay hit me with that poll I'm dropping it in YouTube dropping"
4559620,4564860," it in that YouTube good job do you gonna drop it in that float plane yeah oh you"
4564860,4567500," don't have the float plane stream up you know what I'll do a couple super chats"
4567500,4573380," will we wait it's already up that with Kumar have my free money oh thank you"
4573380,4578540," Steven Elswick hey from someone deployed overseas love your channel having your"
4578540,4582180," content to watch after a long day is higher relaxed and go float plane yeah"
4582180,4586540," you know that if you give us a tip on YouTube they take a bunch of the money"
4586540,4591820," and if you do it on YouTube float plane takes a bunch of the money which is good"
4591820,4600500," I mean thank you thank you appreciate it you know what's really funny we have"
4600500,4603460," had some people we actually need a tip feature because this is probably an"
4603460,4606340," additional tip he's probably subscribe don't float plane already we do yeah"
4606340,4610020," future we have had people that have contacted us asking to pay the higher"
4610020,4614860," tier really that's why I had you update the description being like hey you get"
4614860,4618380," all the same things and then we had some people be like yeah no I just want to"
4618380,4623940," pay more like what is 4k gonna be ready okay a pretty soon okay well we can"
4623940,4628180," roll out a 4k option that'd be pretty sweet and then I actually do we have do"
4628180,4632300," we have a feature yet to like quickly export like people's emails if they want"
4632300,4635180," to be on like a special mailing list so like whenever like when our text post"
4635180,4641340," coming that is when are all the features coming Luke the the the the user list"
4641340,4645100," export thing yes is something that was brought up very recently by e-boss box"
4645100,4649900," I'm sure it was and is not currently road mapped but is interesting interesting"
4649900,4653260," we're currently trying to like fix some things now that we've onboarded some"
4653260,4656260," creators some more problems of surface because we have an onboarded creators"
4656260,4659180," in forever so we're trying to like smooth those over and then keep moving"
4659180,4663940," forward okay I'm posting the link to twitch okay which got ignored for a little"
4663940,4668260," bit you guys do a show about trying to get free sync working on a g-sync monitor"
4668260,4678140," we could I actually don't know I don't know if you can do that because variable"
4678140,4681860," refresh rate like that implementation of variable refresh rate from free sync"
4681860,4686100," may specifically not be supported by NVIDIA scalar which is like a hardware"
4686100,4690260," piece in the monitor I don't know the answers I don't know so I might have"
4690260,4694060," said something dumb just there but it wasn't my fault or at least wasn't my"
4694060,4697780," intention all right let's have a look at our straw poll results have you had"
4697780,4701380," your battery swap your phone more than once wow so not many people actually"
4701380,4707420," no and this is from an enthusiast crowd so you are you okay so okay hold on a"
4707420,4711340," second here so are you suggesting then actually I have a couple of different"
4711340,4715580," angles here so you suggesting that we should just treat a battery swap once"
4715580,4720500," every three to four years as part of device maintenance and then after that"
4720500,4725100," the phone has probably exceeded its usable lifespan anyway so off to the"
4725100,4730940," recycler basically okay let me suggest that our enthusiast crowd may have"
4730940,4734700," actually swayed this poll the opposite way you might think because they're"
4734700,4738580," buying devices they're probably buying devices more often"
4738580,4744940," interesting this is part of the problem with like pulling you guys yeah any like"
4744940,4749180," specific crowd we need we need like a wider net that's interesting that might"
4749180,4756500," actually be very true I don't know because I know I think the only person in my"
4756500,4761460," personal life that isn't me or you that's gotten their phone serviced or has"
4761460,4764740," worked on their phone to the point of taking it apart and swapping things that"
4764740,4769340," wasn't like the hot swap removable batteries from back in the day is like"
4769340,4773980," one of my parents and that's it right yeah so like I don't know of that many"
4773980,4776860," people that do it but that's also an extremely narrow scope so that doesn't"
4776860,4783100," help either I don't know ultimate fails any plan to make a left phone pocket"
4783100,4788980," stealth hoodie oh wow we covered that Ethan free speech laws in the US are"
4788980,4792540," sticky some speech becomes an action for example death threats are illegal"
4792540,4795180," regardless of how they're conveyed yep that's a good point we did bring this up"
4795180,4798860," Iliad hey guys before I'll text you promised to host the next man show wearing"
4798860,4803220," only underwear including bras did you lie we didn't lie we forgot and we also"
4803220,4807820," didn't promise but I forgot I totally am down to do that okay well you don't"
4807820,4811260," have to it's fine win config today we learn Linus is mostly libertarian"
4811260,4818860," regarding speech at least here's the thing labels are bad yeah labels do not"
4818860,4825020," promote independent thought so no I would never call myself a libertarian I"
4825020,4829260," would never call myself a conservative I would never call myself a liberal I"
4829260,4832740," would never call myself right wing left wing or even centrist so I was gonna"
4832740,4838180," grab one of those yeah I know and then use it against I would never say that"
4838180,4846500," Hitler was okay that that clip of me doesn't know someone's I know yeah I know"
4846500,4851820," but if it didn't someone would just be fake the rest of it on I know right so"
4851820,4856500," anyway I would never use a label to describe myself because a label does not"
4856500,4862940," adequately convey the thoughts that I have about these kinds of complex issues"
4862940,4869140," there and they shouldn't for you either because just because the other"
4869140,4874700," libertarians think something doesn't mean that you should not every personal"
4874700,4880300," liberty makes sense some of them do but you have to actually think critically"
4880300,4886180," about whether things are a good idea yeah David says depending on if you're"
4886180,4888700," talking about free speech as the first amendment protection or free speech as a"
4888700,4894180," concept because there's a distinction there that is correct but either way"
4894180,4899420," what I said stands nope says you should collab with my car mods that would"
4899420,4905420," actually be sick yeah Thomas says name your upload time and dot beats for really"
4905420,4911300," cool and be 67 any chance of purchasing a float plane t-shirt we don't have"
4911300,4914100," plans for that right now but there's something that we've given some thought"
4914100,4920180," to yeah Quidro says just replaced my GTX 780 willing to sell it to line us for"
4920180,4926060," $500 great deal I bought it new for 650 have original box and receipt can't hold"
4926060,4933020," it for long GPUs are hot right now I think that message took about a year and"
4933020,4936220," a half to come through to us"
4937260,4943980," spaghetti though I'm auctioning the domain plain float dot com on go tag yeah he's"
4943980,4947900," been bugging me about that good luck with that we have no interest how fun"
4947900,4952300," dude thanks for the money how to overclock a laptop I 7 you need to have an"
4952300,4955500," overclockable laptop and then need to press the overclocking button in most"

5044620,5048940," exactly a style expert it costs more money I liked it not much it's a style"
5048940,5054380," decision okay well Reggie says just wanted to give some support for getting"
5054380,5059660," the epic news in there yeah it's big deal joggers are running shoes do shorts"
