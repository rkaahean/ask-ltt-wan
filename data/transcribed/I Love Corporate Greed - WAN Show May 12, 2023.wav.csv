0,5000," - You're with life."
5000,8320," Sick."
8320,9320," - What?"
9320,10160," - What?"
10160,14760," - Really?"
14760,18680," - What's up everyone?"
18680,20240," Welcome to the WAN Show."
20240,23240," We've got a fantastic show lined up for you today."
23240,25640," First and foremost, as you guys can see from the title,"
25640,28480," we've got to talk about what shameless shills we are."
28480,30440," - Yeah. - Shilling for a suits"
30440,32840," and sponsored by them and not addressing"
32840,35120," the big controversy, which obviously we'll be talking about"
35120,37560," on the WAN Show, I usually talk about such things."
37560,40040," We're also gonna be talking about Google I/O."
40040,45040," Man, it was an AI extravaganza this year."
45040,46440," What else we got this week?"
46440,48960," - YouTube blocks ad block."
48960,49800," - What?"
49800,50640," - Counter block."
50640,53520," - No, I'm gonna block their block of my block."
53520,55680," (groans)"
55680,58840," I don't know how to follow that."
58840,60960," 'Cause you got blocked."
60960,64800," - Oh man, we already talked about the former Uber CSO"
64800,66760," being found guilty for concealing a data breach."
66760,69680," So maybe we should talk about how a Chinese company"
69680,73680," released a new CPU."
73680,74520," - Oh, okay."
74520,76840," We could also talk about smart watches"
76840,79560," that you can no longer set the time on."
79560,80400," - Oh wow."
80400,82360," - Yeah, what?"
82360,83200," - I wrote the intro."
83200,85000," You can't see 'cause we don't have to preview that."
85000,85840," - Yeah."
85840,88420," (upbeat music)"
88420,104200," - The show is brought to you today by ASUS."
104200,106160," Square, oh sorry, I wasn't supposed to say that part."
106160,110000," Squarespace, see Sonic and JumpCloud."
110000,113080," All right guys, in all seriousness,"
113080,115600," we've gotta talk about the big controversy"
115600,120360," that has been making big waves in the techosphere"
120360,122520," over the last, I mean, realistically,"
122520,124440," the whole thing started a few weeks ago"
124440,128480," when we saw that CPU that got popped and burned on the bottom."
128480,130720," We talked about that on WAN Show."
130720,132160," We did talk about that on WAN Show,"
132160,133000," some people have said,"
133000,134600," \"Hey, what's up with you guys not talking about this"
134600,135920," \"at all we actually did?\""
135920,137840," And then we've been kind of waiting to learn more"
137840,140560," and learn more we have."
140560,143960," Gamers Nexus has completed their series of videos"
143960,147040," about what's been going on with Ryzen X3D chips"
147040,149880," that have been, well, I think blowing up"
149880,151640," is probably a little bit melodramatic,"
151640,154200," but burning up is certainly a way"
154200,157320," that we could describe them due to higher than anticipated"
157320,160120," voltages being applied by particularly"
160120,163440," some motherboard manufacturers, Bioses and ASUS"
163440,166240," seems to be at the center of this controversy."
166240,169000," Now there's been a lot of questions under our review"
169000,172120," of the ROG ally that went up yesterday"
172120,173520," asking why that..."
173520,177640," You know, I didn't even say the word"
177640,179000," 'cause I couldn't find my swear button."
179000,182320," The point is why haven't we addressed this?"
182320,185240," And why are we shilling for ASUS"
185240,188360," when everyone else is mad trying to..."
188360,189200," Okay."
189200,191480," - You wouldn't like him when he's angry."
191480,193920," - It was a review of a handheld."
193920,196600," That was the embargo lift day."
196600,199200," There was no coordinated anything."
199200,201560," If it was sponsored, you'd know because it would have said,"
201560,205440," it was sponsored by Deep Red for crying out loud."
205440,206680," - It's a showcase or something, right?"
206680,210160," - Look, I've had my fair share of controversies"
210160,211680," over the last couple of years."
211680,214280," And in some cases, man, I had it coming."
214280,217720," But this is one of those ones that I'm looking at going,"
217720,219360," - Hey, hold on, wait a minute."
219360,220360," - What?"
220360,222600," We don't even review motherboards."
222600,226320," - And haven't for like a really long time."
226320,231040," The one motherboard video that we've uploaded in the last year"
231040,234800," was on some weird one that we got off Reddit"
234800,237000," that had an AMD CPU socket,"
237000,238840," but was a Z490 chipset."
238840,241520," It was some chipset that never got released."
241520,243520," And we're like, \"Hey, cool, I wanna play with that.\""
243520,244360," - That's a little different."
244360,245960," - We don't review motherboards."
245960,248400," So the reason that we haven't covered it yet"
248400,250880," is because there hasn't been WAN show yet."
250880,252840," That's why we didn't cover it."
252840,255640," Also, man, the conspiracy theories."
255640,256640," - Nope, you're a show."
256640,259480," - The conspiracy theories about how paid off"
259480,261960," that ROG ally video was."
261960,264320," I don't even know what to tell you guys."
264320,267000," We opened the video criticizing it suits"
267000,269120," for their shady marketing of the thing."
269120,271520," 'Cause I was pissed."
271520,275160," I got brought in to do this preview where they go,"
275160,277440," okay, you know, yeah, blah, blah, blah,"
277440,278800," up to two times faster."
278800,280280," And then I'm sitting here going,"
280280,282360," okay, now that we've tested this more extensively,"
282360,285240," these up twos are not great."
285240,287720," So the first thing we did was go after them"
287720,289200," for shady marketing."
289200,292760," Do you honestly search your soul?"
292760,297120," Do you honestly believe that anyone at a Suce marketing"
297120,300880," approved us criticizing their shady marketing?"
300880,308140," (laughing)"
308140,315200," Anyway, the truth is almost a week before J-Poo"
315240,318040," posted his video, we had already informed a Suce"
318040,321360," that if they didn't deal with some unrelated issues"
321360,324200," related to customer service that had popped up on our forum,"
324200,326760," we were gonna be putting all of our sponsor deals"
326760,328000," with them on pause."
328000,331280," The good news is that we can kind of get through everything"
331280,333400," that they have said in response to that,"
333400,336440," as well as the update that we've gotten from them today"
336440,337960," about what they're doing regarding"
337960,339360," the whole beta bio situation."
339360,342800," But before we do that, we need to catch you guys up"
342800,346400," if you're not sure what the heck has been going on."
346400,350680," So, a Suce responded to the overheating/burning up,"
350680,352480," I think is really a better way to put it,"
352480,355880," overheating issue with Ryzen 7000 X3D chips"
355880,358800," with a rapid beta BIOS update,"
358800,362680," which was supposed to cap SOC voltage to 1.3 volts."
362680,366040," That beta BIOS was, and still is on some pages"
366040,368320," at least labeled with a disclaimer indicating"
368320,372400," that installing it would void the user's warranty."
372400,377400," So, the perception was, I'm sorry, I bought your product,"
377400,382800," okay, and my options are either I haven't died,"
382800,387800," or I maybe still haven't died, but I can apply the fix,"
387800,391840," but then I get no warranty?"
391840,393800," Are you for real?"
393800,397280," Now, a Suce claims that this is standard boiler plate"
397280,400440," legalese that is attached to all of their beta BIOSes."
400440,401600," - And that seems true."
401600,403600," - That actually, we did actually check that."
403600,406280," So, we used an archived version of a Suce's site"
406280,409200," from last year that actually does appear to be attached"
409200,411600," to all of their beta BIOSes."
411600,414400," They told us that they did not intend to communicate"
414400,416200," that they wouldn't respect user's warranties,"
416200,418000," and that they will honor the warranty"
418000,419640," of any user affected by the beta BIOS,"
419640,421320," Expo enabled or not."
421320,424800," This is really good news, and is something that,"
424800,428120," quite frankly, I would have expected from them anyway."
428120,433120," A Suce is, here, hold on, this is great."
433120,436560," I've got a quote in here from,"
436560,440000," I think Riley was actually working on this topic in the doc."
440000,442120," Yeah, here we go."
442120,445400," So, more takeaways from our calls with a Suce"
445400,446840," that Riley was involved in."
446840,449560," They say they were more focused on fixing the issue,"
449560,451680," and making sure customers weren't continuing"
451680,455520," to damage their boards than they were focused on PR."
455520,458400," Yeah, that's pretty obvious,"
458400,462640," because the PR job that they've done here is atrocious,"
462640,465520," and I wish I could say that this was an isolated incident,"
465520,470520," but they are spectacularly bad at communication,"
470520,473680," and they are spectacularly bad"
473680,475520," at creating action plans sometimes."
475520,478120," I mean, this is the kind of thing that you see often"
478120,481280," when you've got a company where there's a regional branch"
481280,483720," that is engaging directly with consumers,"
483720,486480," in this case, a Suce USA or North America,"
486480,488320," really, they cover the whole region,"
488320,491320," and then you've got a Taiwanese head office branch"
491320,493640," that makes all the actual decisions."
493640,495600," The opportunity for the left hand"
495600,498240," to have absolutely no idea what the right hand is doing"
498240,500320," is, well, this."
500320,501160," Constant."
501160,503600," (laughs)"
503600,507800," Anyway, I'm glad to hear that they are doing the right thing."
507800,510040," I fully expected them to do the right thing."
510040,511600," We had already gotten in touch with them"
511600,513560," over a couple of customer support issues"
513560,515600," that were posted in our sponsor."
515600,518480," It's either sponsor concerns or sponsor complaints thread"
518480,519800," over on the forum."
519800,521720," That's one of the ways that we ensure"
521720,524360," that our community is being taken care of by our sponsors,"
524360,526800," and my understanding is at least one of those"
526800,528960," was actually a complete miscommunication."
528960,532120," It was someone who was mad on behalf of someone else"
532120,535680," who already had a replacement board nearly a month ago."
535680,536840," Oh, wow."
536840,539600," But they were mad about the way, as he's handled it,"
539600,542080," which is justifiable, but at a certain point,"
542080,542920," you kind of have to ask,"
542920,545920," what do you want other than a replacement motherboard?"
545920,547160," 'Cause stuff's gonna break."
547160,548840," Stuff happens from time to time."
548840,552560," And I can't say I have all the details of that one."
552560,556960," All I know is I sent an email 10 days ago"
556960,560600," that said this needs to go away or everything's on pause."
560600,564120," And now I have heard back that it is gone."
564120,566720," So that's at a certain point,"
566720,569280," I can't get into the nitty gritty details of everything."
569280,570120," Yeah."
570120,570960," Yeah, yeah."
570960,572120," Anywho."
572120,574800," Hey, Sue says they have already changed the disclaimer."
574800,576360," So it doesn't make it sound like updating"
576360,578640," to the beta BIOS to avoid your warranty,"
578640,580600," but the change may take some time to propagate"
580600,582600," across all of their sites."
582600,586080," Complicating matters in all of this."
586080,588680," GamersNex has tested motherboards after the beta update"
588680,591000," and found that they were still exceeding safe voltages"
591000,592280," at 1.4 volts."
592280,594280," So yeah, that would have been a big problem"
594280,596640," if people actually weren't getting their boards"
596640,598280," covered under warranty."
598280,600360," But the thing is realistically,"
600360,603440," regardless of the pressure from users and from media,"
603440,607120," this is not the sort of thing that AMD would have allowed anyway."
607120,609520," If it was causing their chips to die,"
609520,611480," it's something that they would have been working closely"
611480,615320," with Asus to remediate and ensure that their collective,"
615320,619160," their shared customers were not going to have"
619160,620840," an extremely sour taste in their mouth"
620840,624760," because you gotta understand that not everyone"
624760,628160," who is going to encounter this issue is highly technical,"
628160,630640," is watching channels like LTT or GamersNexis,"
630640,632160," which is two cents or whatever else."
632160,634480," There's people out there that buy a motherboard"
634480,636480," the same way that I would buy,"
636480,639520," man, what would be a comparison?"
639520,640960," - A tire. - RC car."
640960,642240," - Sure. - Yeah, okay, sure."
642240,643960," We both went with things that roll."
643960,646720," So same wavelength."
646720,649000," This is how we work, ladies and gentlemen."
649000,653120," Where I know enough to know that,"
653120,656320," okay, I need an ESC, I need a battery,"
656320,658560," I need either an RTR,"
658560,661840," like a ready to roll, I think it is,"
661840,662800," is what that stands for."
662800,664920," I know I need a transmitter or maybe I don't"
664920,666240," if I get one that includes one."
666240,668120," Like I have some idea of everything,"
668120,672680," but other than, oh yeah, I think Traxxas is like"
672680,676160," pretty good, but overpriced and like,"
676160,679520," ARMA used to be pretty like budget friendly,"
679520,681440," but then they like got bought by someone."
681440,683240," Like I kinda know a little bit about it,"
683240,685680," but not enough to make a truly informed decision."
685680,689360," A lot of people going into this would be like that."
689360,694360," And so if all they know is, yeah, AMD good, AMD CPU fry,"
694360,697800," that reflects really poorly on everyone involved"
697800,699800," and it's in everyone's best interest to get this fixed"
699800,701200," because believe it or not,"
701200,704320," nobody likes issuing warranty replacements."
704320,705960," And if they can get them fixed in the field,"
705960,708080," that's absolutely what they're going to be doing."
708080,712000," And while ASUS has absolutely been involved"
712000,716320," in some pretty frustrating warranty drama over the years,"
716320,721240," I've gotta say that every time something's been flagged to me,"
721240,724080," it's either been resolved before I got a chance"
724080,725560," to really look into it,"
725560,728880," or it's been resolved with me sending a quiet ping"
728880,731440," and it's gone away."
731440,732640," - It shouldn't have to get to that point."
732640,733760," - It should never get to that point,"
733760,735400," but in some cases, like I'm trying,"
735400,736240," the most recent-- - There's always going"
736240,737240," to be something."
737240,739240," - The most recent one was someone mad"
739240,741320," because they were ARMAing a laptop."
741320,744240," And that laptop model was no longer produced."
744240,749040," So they were offered a much, much higher spec laptop"
749040,752200," that had a GPU that was like wildly faster and a CPU"
752200,754440," that was either one or two generations newer."
754440,755960," - Okay. - Okay."
755960,758400," Then ASUS went, wait, sorry,"
758400,761480," we actually can't get that one either, but we've got this."
761480,764280," And they were offered one that was still--"
764280,766440," - Still better, but not as good as the first--"
766440,769920," - But AMD, which I perceived as better,"
769920,772560," but with a slightly lesser GPU,"
772560,775080," which, yeah, sucks from a gaming standpoint,"
775080,777280," but is also good from a power consumption standpoint"
777280,780880," and was still way better than what they were originally offered."
780880,782520," So they were offered one and then they were like,"
782520,784400," oh crap, no, I actually don't have that,"
784400,787080," but I'll give you this one that is better rare in this way"
787080,788960," and unbetter rare in this other way."
788960,791000," And they wanted me to do a whole exposé about it"
791000,793120," and they sent me a whole thing on the forum"
793120,796480," and I'm looking at it going, I would take the laptop."
796480,798760," - Yeah. - I think you should take the laptop."
798760,801120," - It's still significantly better"
801120,802760," than the one that you had, like, I don't know."
802760,806360," - And that was still a crappy customer experience"
806360,808280," because nobody likes to be offered something"
808280,809600," and then rug pulled, right?"
809600,811640," If they had something that they were happy with,"
811640,812480," then that sucks."
812480,813640," - I mean, it's like rug pulled,"
813640,816040," but then they also put a really nice pillow under you"
816040,816960," before you fall."
816960,818960," - Well, yeah. - It's still better"
818960,821840," than what you were, better than you had,"
821840,823200," which is more than I would expect."
823200,825840," - Honestly, I think the underlying issue here"
825840,830120," is that there's this attitude in the IT industry"
830120,833680," that customer service after the fact is kind of,"
833680,835720," it's an afterthought."
835720,838240," It's not something that very many companies"
838240,840200," make a core part of their brand,"
840200,842240," which is why it makes me so unhappy"
842240,844680," that EVGA pulled out of GPUs."
844680,848680," But you can see that for them to maintain"
848680,850520," that level of service and that reputation,"
850520,851720," you need margin."
851720,855120," And there just obviously wasn't enough margin left in GPUs"
855120,856680," for them to continue to do that."
856680,861960," All right, let's get back to a SUS not being perfect"
861960,866160," for a long spell here."
866160,867800," Man, you guys."
867800,869000," Another complication."
869000,871280," As SUS changed the CPU support table"
871280,874320," for some other boards indicating that X3D CPUs"
874320,876680," have only been validated since"
876680,880160," the most recent non-beta BIOS release, 1303,"
880160,882440," yet the list of BIOS updates still says"
882440,886000," the older 12.02 releases recommended for optimum performance"
886000,888320," with X3D processors."
888320,890920," Some users suggested this was done to suggest"
890920,893000," that X3D wasn't supported on 12.02."
893000,894960," According to a SUS, this was done to ensure"
894960,898240," that users only download the most safe BIOS going forward."
898240,902480," Yeah."
902480,905640," Okay, some more takeaways."
905640,908480," Yeah, we've got the thing about how they suck at PR."
908480,910680," So at least they know, I guess that's good."
910680,913480," We asked them if they would consider putting up notices"
913480,915440," slash updates on their support pages"
915440,917560," to prevent people from getting the wrong idea."
917560,919080," They said they couldn't comment on that"
919080,921800," and again mentioned there would be an FAQ next week"
921800,924320," and Riley put in italics just in time."
924320,925400," Yeah."
925400,927240," That's the biggest thing."
927240,929000," Like if they're gonna comment to you,"
929000,931680," oh, well, like people actually have this, whatever."
931680,932920," That needs to be on their site."
932920,934240," You know what happened though?"
934240,936480," I wasn't on the call."
936480,939320," I don't have any kind of Riley came in asking,"
939320,942000," \"Hey, we can't get a proper response from ASUS.\""
942000,945360," Clearly, clearly did after, but he came in and talked to me."
945360,947160," He was like, \"Hey, we're having trouble getting in touch"
947160,948160," \"with someone."
948160,950040," \"Do you have anyone there you can talk to?\""
950040,951960," I'm like, \"No, I hired my ASUS contact.\""
951960,954520," (laughing)"
954520,957280," No, I actually don't really know anybody there anymore."
957280,958920," But I mean, I would be pissed."
958920,961240," Like if I was an ASUS customer"
961240,962720," and I ran through this scenario,"
962720,964000," I would be royally pissed off."
964000,964840," But you know what?"
964840,967120," I'll tell you what happened is the technical people"
967120,968720," know exactly what's going on"
968720,970040," and are working on it."
970040,973000," The PR people are sitting there trying to understand"
973000,974800," what the technical people are telling them."
974800,976840," And then the legal department is getting in here saying,"
976840,978600," \"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, we don't want to commit"
978600,979440," \"to anything.\""
979440,982200," Don't say anything, everything boilerplate,"
982200,987200," everything CYA, and then we can always make exceptions"
987200,990680," case by case by case by case, do all of them."
990680,993160," I don't care, but don't put anything out there."
993160,995040," Yeah, but they already did put out there"
995040,996400," that they were gonna screw everyone."
996400,997720," So they gotta do something."
997720,998960," That's the problem."
998960,1001720," At a certain point, you have to tell your legal team"
1001720,1003600," to kind of screw off and just deal with it."
1003600,1007080," Well, the thing that happens when you tell your legal team"
1007080,1009400," to screw off and deal with it is that--"
1009400,1010400," You end up with trust me, bro, team."
1010400,1011240," You leave your team."
1011240,1012080," You leave your team."
1012080,1014320," (laughing)"
1014320,1020240," Hey, in fairness to me, okay,"
1020240,1021760," did we take care of everyone?"
1021760,1022600," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
1022600,1024520," Were we going to anyway?"
1024520,1025360," Yeah."
1025360,1026200," Okay, trust me, bro."
1026200,1027560," (laughing)"
1027560,1030200," So you're saying that they're pulling a trust me, bro."
1030200,1031360," Is that it?"
1031360,1033040," Yeah, but then..."
1033040,1037000," But then we're talking about bad communication"
1037000,1038440," and all that kind of stuff in the past."
1038440,1039480," So like it's..."
1039480,1042520," I mean, okay, then it's a full trust me, bro,"
1042520,1044760," because that's part of it."
1044760,1050400," That's a key element of the trust me, bro, trifecta."
1050400,1053520," Okay, you've got the overconfidence in your own image."
1053520,1057000," You've got the sort of appearance of sketchy behavior"
1057000,1059800," or maybe even downright sketchy behavior."
1059800,1062360," And then you've got the, what was the last one?"
1062360,1063800," The crappy communication."
1063800,1064640," Yeah, yeah."
1064640,1065560," You got all three."
1065560,1067520," It's perfect."
1067520,1068360," Yeah, I don't know."
1068360,1069960," You should license it to them or something."
1069960,1072160," Yeah, you don't what?"
1072160,1073360," You know what would be amazing."
1073360,1074200," Amazing."
1074200,1075040," We can handle this."
1075040,1079840," We create our own better business bureau clone, okay?"
1079840,1082000," But it's just TMB."
1082000,1084240," And accredited businesses can display"
1084240,1086320," the trust me, bro, seal on their website."
1086320,1088440," Oh, so it's like Secret Shopper"
1088440,1090240," and you get a TMB seal"
1090240,1092520," and you get like a different like grade"
1092520,1095160," based on how well you did in Secret Shopper."
1095160,1096360," I'm so excited."
1096360,1100640," Now, actually on that subject,"
1100640,1101960," oh, that didn't make it into the notes."
1101960,1102800," I had fired that."
1102800,1103640," You know what, it doesn't matter."
1103640,1105360," This is a very dense topic."
1105360,1108480," So on that subject, we have our own ways"
1108480,1110520," of holding folks accountable."
1110520,1111800," We don't review motherboards, right?"
1111800,1112880," So it's not the kind of thing"
1112880,1115000," that we deep dive into day and day out,"
1115000,1116360," at least not now."
1116360,1117800," As the lab gets up and running,"
1117800,1120560," you can fully expect to see more coverage"
1120560,1123280," of things like individual models of graphics cards"
1123280,1126080," and motherboards and power supplies and things like that."
1126080,1128840," In fact, we're shooting a lab update early next week"
1128840,1130360," that is going to show you guys"
1130360,1132920," the power supply tester is finally fully configured."
1132920,1135760," We had Chroma out here earlier this week"
1135760,1137320," to get us the training on it."
1137320,1138920," Really excited to show you guys"
1138920,1140000," that we're going to blow up a power supply."
1140000,1141960," It's going to be awesome."
1141960,1142960," What was I saying?"
1142960,1143800," Right."
1143800,1145320," We'll be making more of that from us in the future."
1145320,1147920," But that doesn't mean that we don't have other things"
1147920,1149760," that are in the works in order to keep"
1149760,1151920," not just the industry accountable,"
1151920,1154080," but actually our sponsor specifically."
1154080,1156200," So I can finally announce this,"
1156200,1157960," but it's been because it's been in the works"
1157960,1159920," for I think a couple of months now."
1159920,1163120," We are going to be doing round one"
1163120,1166720," of secret shopping, our sponsors."
1166720,1168640," Ah, we anonymously--"
1168640,1169760," So we've-- So it's done already, right?"
1169760,1172480," Yeah, 'cause we don't talk about doing it unless it's done."
1172480,1174080," Yeah, always--"
1174080,1177920," I always like to keep my cards pretty close to my chest"
1177920,1180800," when it comes to sponsorships."
1180800,1184360," But-- or excuse me, when it comes to secret shopper."
1184360,1187000," We're very transparent about our sponsorships."
1187000,1192640," But this one has progressed to the point"
1192640,1198080," where we have collected a lot of interesting information."
1198080,1199680," And this is going to be one of the ways"
1199680,1202440," that we continue to evaluate ongoing sponsor"
1202440,1204120," relationships going forward."
1204120,1205960," That's something we're going to talk about in more detail"
1205960,1207640," once we actually come up with the video."
1207640,1209640," But we had one of our probationary employees"
1209640,1212280," who's not listed anywhere publicly,"
1212280,1215840," just buy things completely anonymously."
1215840,1219840," And then in some cases, fabricate issues"
1219840,1222520," so that they could get in touch with their support"
1222520,1224960," and just documented the entire process."
1224960,1225800," I'm really excited."
1225800,1227520," I haven't seen any of the results."
1227520,1229600," In fact, I didn't even pick which sponsors"
1229600,1231480," we were going to do so-- Is it Seuss in it?"
1231480,1232600," I actually don't know."
1232600,1233600," Oh, man."
1233600,1236480," That would be really interesting."
1236480,1241560," Yeah, I mean, I wonder if I could find out for you guys."
1241560,1242920," You know what?"
1242920,1243760," No."
1243760,1245400," Cards to my chest."
1245400,1246720," We're going to just--"
1246720,1248200," We're going to blindside everybody with it."
1248200,1251400," One thing that I'm unsure of right now,"
1251400,1252680," just reading the Seuss topic."
1252680,1255040," Because I saw some of it, but not a ton up"
1255040,1258360," until when I read the doc."
1258360,1261280," In the private communication that we theoretically have,"
1261280,1262680," they're talking about how they're going to deal with it"
1262680,1263880," and everybody's going to be fine."
1263880,1265160," Yes."
1265160,1269200," What public communication has there been at all?"
1269200,1272480," Other than these postings, it doesn't seem like they"
1272480,1275120," have done a particularly good job of publicly communicating."
1275120,1277280," So as of right now, if someone didn't watch this,"
1277280,1279800," they would still think that their warranty was void"
1279800,1280920," if they ran the thing."
1280920,1283120," Is that correct?"
1283120,1284360," I actually don't know."
1284360,1287360," I think they said that they are updating the messaging,"
1287360,1289520," but it hasn't fully propagated."
1289520,1290040," Still not done yet."
1290040,1291760," Yeah."
1291760,1296440," Or is that just them removing the disclaimer, right?"
1296440,1297640," Let me have a look here."
1297640,1297920," Hold on."
1297920,1300480," I've actually got a screen capture"
1300480,1302720," that I can show you guys here in my notes."
1302720,1304640," Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop."
1304640,1306920," Except as provided in the product warranty"
1306920,1308600," and to the maximum extent permitted by law,"
1308600,1311480," I see this is not responsible for the incidental or consequential"
1311480,1312720," damage resulting from using."
1312720,1314000," Yeah, so this is the original wording."
1314000,1317920," I believe that original wording is still there on some pages"
1317920,1321840," and will continue to be until it actually propagates."
1321840,1322680," Now here's the thing."
1322680,1324400," It was worded as rollout."
1324400,1327240," So it's actually potential that those pages haven't even started."
1327240,1328080," Now here's the thing."
1328080,1329840," With trust me, bro, right?"
1329840,1332200," Remember, where I got into trouble"
1332200,1336120," was because I knew in my head that if there was ever"
1336120,1338600," any kind of issue, we would deal with it."
1338600,1341320," Maybe they know in their heads that if there's ever"
1341320,1343800," any kind of issue, they will deal with it."
1343800,1347200," But because of their somewhat spotty history"
1347200,1348960," with customer service, I don't know if they've actually"
1348960,1350640," earned that for one thing."
1350640,1354520," And for another, if they have communicated"
1354520,1357400," that warranty is not going to cover this,"
1357400,1362280," unless someone gets mad and messages support,"
1362280,1365480," they might not realize and they might just go buy another board"
1365480,1367880," thinking that their warranty is invalid."
1367880,1370720," And that would really suck."
1370720,1371520," Now--"
1371520,1372840," I would bet you money."
1372840,1374200," That has already happened."
1374200,1375280," Now a piece--"
1375280,1376720," Like probably a bunch."
1376720,1384120," Now a piece that I do not know is how many actual--"
1384120,1384960," Affected users?"
1384960,1387320," How many actual CPUs have burned?"
1387320,1391120," Does anyone have any kind of idea of that?"
1391120,1392320," Anyone?"
1392320,1394000," And even if it's-- here's the thing."
1394000,1399920," Even if it's only one or five or 50, whatever that number is,"
1399920,1403720," that doesn't necessarily mean that everyone's out of the woods."
1403720,1405840," If you've been accidentally applying"
1405840,1407760," a higher than expected voltage to a CPU--"
1407760,1408960," Could cause some permanent damage."
1408960,1414400," It could cause its lifespan to decrease in a way"
1414400,1416560," that is not obvious immediately."
1416560,1423360," So this is pretty terribly handled."
1423360,1425960," Yeah, we've got some people that are really confused."
1425960,1427520," All of processor over on floatplane"
1427520,1429040," says this isn't how anything works, Linus."
1429040,1430640," There's no such thing as brand trust"
1430640,1433400," unless you've drank the Kool-Aid."
1433400,1436200," There is such a thing as reputation, though."
1436200,1440280," This is the kind of argument that ended up creating,"
1440280,1445080," I think, a lot of the negative sort of circular arguments"
1445080,1448120," that existed back during the Trust me, bro."
1448120,1451760," Controversy is like once we had the limited lifetime"
1451760,1456320," warranty up, the people who were still mad--"
1456320,1457880," So people would point out, hey, they've"
1457880,1459480," got their limited lifetime warranty up."
1459480,1461960," Everything is fine, and everyone is completely covered."
1461960,1464000," People would say, oh, and by the way,"
1464000,1466840," this is the same as these other brands"
1466840,1469880," that have a great reputation for covering their customers."
1469880,1471440," And people would respond and say, yeah,"
1471440,1473440," but those guys have a great reputation."
1473440,1476600," So obviously, their word is better."
1476600,1478560," And then it's like, are you even listening to yourself?"
1478560,1483760," Because you can't apply that logic to one and not to another."
1483760,1486600," Like I said, ASUS's reputation is not"
1486600,1489960," one that I would look at and go, yeah, obviously,"
1489960,1492760," they're just 100% going to deal with this."
1492760,1495720," It's not the worst, but it isn't that either."
1495720,1497560," But that doesn't mean that no company"
1497560,1500400," can have a reputation for customer service."
1500400,1502240," I mean, by that logic, why don't you just"
1502240,1504680," buy everything from some brand you've never"
1504680,1506840," heard of on AliExpress?"
1506840,1507960," I wouldn't."
1507960,1510440," I would rather have some idea that I'm probably"
1510440,1513080," going to get taken care of."
1513080,1514560," Right?"
1514560,1516760," Apparently, I'm supposed to tell Ryan from customer service"
1516760,1517160," they're great."
1517160,1520520," OK, shout out Ryan from customer service."
1520520,1523600," I wouldn't, even if I had-- so I have never"
1523600,1525680," dealt with ASUS customer service."
1525680,1527600," I've had a bunch of ASUS things, and none of their stuff"
1527600,1530760," has ever died on me that I didn't just straight up kill,"
1530760,1533000," or it was like a decade old already."
1533000,1535400," So that's good, but it's not a reflection"
1535400,1537440," of the customer service at all."
1537440,1540600," The only customer service that I've really dealt with"
1540600,1541320," in this realm is EVG."
1541320,1542600," I've told that story a bunch of times."
1542600,1543640," I don't need to tell it again."
1543640,1544480," It was very, very good."
1544480,1547640," EVG's customer support was the best customer support"
1547640,1549440," I've ever dealt with in any realm ever."
1549440,1554320," But if I saw this, I wouldn't believe"
1554320,1555400," that they were going to handle it."
1555400,1556840," And if they've had no communication"
1556840,1561400," that they're going to handle it, yeah, I don't know."
1561400,1565480," I'm not willing to necessarily condemn"
1565480,1569520," until we see what they actually do."
1569520,1572200," But yeah, if I was a user and this happened to me,"
1572200,1575200," right now I would be royally pissed off."
1575200,1577200," And I think they have a right to be."
1577200,1578760," They're told that they're screwed"
1578760,1580440," and there was no follow-up communication."
1580440,1581920," That can't happen."
1581920,1584640," This has got to be resolved."
1584640,1586720," At least during the trust me bro thing,"
1586720,1590720," you were saying, trust me bro, we're going to handle it."
1590720,1593280," They aren't saying anything as far as my understanding goes."
1593280,1596920," So what are people supposed to take from this?"
1596920,1599080," Like that was the trust me bro thing,"
1599080,1600920," there was some form of quote saying"
1600920,1602320," that you're going to be handled."
1602320,1604200," The thing wasn't done, they wanted a warranty."
1604200,1605560," That time of stuff wasn't handled yet,"
1605560,1608000," but you're like, it's coming, we're figuring it out, trust me."
1608000,1610320," This one, there is none of that."
1610320,1613080," I'm not saying that that is, if they come out"
1613080,1616320," and just go like, oh, LOLTMB, we licensed it from Linus,"
1616320,1619280," whatever, I'm not saying that that would be good."
1619280,1622720," But they're not even at least doing that."
1622720,1623560," You know what I mean?"
1623560,1624560," I don't know."
1624560,1625800," This is rough."
1625800,1626880," This is very rough."
1626880,1628040," - Yeah, I mean--"
1628040,1629680," - I do think they deserve some heat for this."
1629680,1630520," - Yeah, they do."
1630520,1632800," The problem for me is I don't like getting dragged"
1632800,1634160," into their drama."
1634160,1635320," And I'm looking at it this morning,"
1635320,1637800," I'm reading comments on the video from yesterday."
1637800,1638760," - Why is the Linus talking about this?"
1638760,1641040," - And I'm looking at this going like,"
1641040,1645680," holy fuck you guys, how have you not dealt with this?"
1645680,1647320," Make this go away."
1647320,1650480," What do you have to send out a motherboard?"
1650480,1653480," 10 motherboards, 100, but I don't fucking care."
1653480,1654400," - Yeah."
1654400,1656760," - Put them in the fucking mail."
1656760,1658160," What's wrong with you though?"
1658160,1659520," - Yeah, yeah."
1659520,1661760," - And we had, there wasn't even enough time"
1661760,1663200," for us to have a way and show yet."
1663200,1664040," - Yeah."
1664040,1665080," - And we don't cover motherboards."
1665080,1667560," So everyone needs to relax when it comes to us."
1667560,1670120," There's a bunch of people saying that we're like"
1670120,1672040," covering a suits his butt, so I just wanted to be clear"
1672040,1675120," that we're not, we don't think that they did a good job."
1675120,1678320," - And I specifically said, I don't think they've earned"
1678320,1679920," a trust me bro guarantee."
1679920,1680760," - Yes."
1680760,1684200," So if it wasn't clear, hopefully it is now clear."
1684200,1688560," - Yeah, hopefully, basically the only thing"
1688560,1691480," that I think people could look at from what we talked about"
1691480,1693720," and say, you know, well, that sounds like butt covering"
1693720,1696040," is when I mentioned that I don't think that AMD"
1696040,1698080," would be very happy with this situation"
1698080,1699920," if it was actually killing their chips."
1699920,1704920," But really that having been on the other side,"
1704920,1710040," there are absolutely fires and there are people working"
1710040,1713440," on putting out those fires and you are not privy"
1713440,1714480," to a lot of it."
1714480,1716600," That's just not how this works."
1716600,1720080," Not everyone at a company is authorized to speak publicly."
1720080,1722720," Sometimes the people who are authorized to speak publicly"
1722720,1724760," probably shouldn't."
1724760,1727560," This stuff is very real and definitely happens."
1727560,1730340," And I'm sure that they were dealing with this."
1730340,1734520," They clearly did an extraordinarily poor job,"
1734520,1737960," but no, I'm not in a position where I'm never gonna work"
1737960,1739520," with them again or anything like that"
1739520,1743280," because from my point of view, it's much more effective"
1743280,1745800," for me to just say, if you don't deal with this,"
1745800,1747640," I will never work with you again."
1747640,1749840," And then they will deal with it"
1749840,1751600," and then we will continue to work with them."
1751600,1755000," I mean, that's my style of leverage."
1755000,1759040," So, you know, I guess it's not really that different"
1759040,1759880," from Jay's."
1759880,1762360," Like if we look at a sponsor relationship"
1762360,1764920," like a romantic relationship, you know,"
1764920,1767960," I'm basically saying privately, I'm withholding sex"
1767960,1769680," until you change your behavior."
1769680,1771880," And then Jay is posting on Facebook,"
1771880,1773880," I'm withholding sex from my spouse."
1773880,1775120," (laughing)"
1775120,1776280," (laughing)"
1776280,1777360," So that's what we do."
1777360,1780960," Oh man."
1780960,1785960," So what we did with Yufy is I'm never giving you this ever again."
1785960,1788200," Yeah."
1788200,1789880," And what we did that one publicly."
1789880,1792080," Well, that's different though."
1792080,1792920," That's different."
1792920,1796440," That was users' private video data."
1796440,1797280," That was so cool."
1797280,1800160," And they continued to systematically lie about it"
1800160,1801000," over time."
1801000,1802920," I'm not equating the two situations."
1802920,1804800," I'm just saying our response to it wasn't,"
1804800,1806960," I'm withholding temporarily."
1806960,1808320," It was like, we done."
1808320,1809880," I want a poll."
1809880,1810720," A poll."
1810720,1811560," Yeah."
1811560,1813200," I want to hear what people,"
1813200,1815840," how people would rate ASUS's customer service."
1815840,1818160," Out of five."
1818160,1819000," So five options?"
1819000,1819840," Yeah."
1819840,1823640," I would do like one to five and then like NA"
1823640,1824640," or something like that."
1824640,1826360," I want to hear from the float plane audience"
1826360,1829560," 'cause I've got AJ tech saying it's a long block of text."
1829560,1830400," I'm not going to read the whole thing"
1830400,1832680," but basically that they were pretty happy."
1832680,1833680," Yeah."
1833680,1837680," No one else is really talking about it yet."
1837680,1840680," But ma'am, the reality of it is,"
1840680,1844680," I've had really awful experiences"
1844680,1848680," with most of the Taiwanese tech companies"
1848680,1850680," at some point or another."
1850680,1854680," And a lot of that was not, obviously, as a tech reviewer"
1854680,1857680," where I get the white glove treatment, right?"
1857680,1860680," A lot of that is when I was working at NCIX"
1860680,1862680," and seeing the kind of,"
1862680,1864680," the way that they would treat their partners, right?"
1864680,1868680," Because have you guys ever, ever heard the saying?"
1868680,1873680," A man who is kind to you and rude to a waiter"
1873680,1875680," is not a kind man?"
1875680,1876680," Yeah."
1876680,1877680," I like that one."
1877680,1878680," Yeah."
1878680,1882680," That is, those are words to live by right there."
1882680,1886680," And seeing the way that a company treats their partners"
1886680,1893680," is one of the ways that I evaluate the integrity of a company."
1893680,1903680," And the number of, the way that most computer hardware manufacturers"
1903680,1908680," will go to any lengths to try to deny a warranty claim"
1908680,1910680," is frankly kind of gross."
1910680,1911680," It sucks."
1911680,1916680," There are some standout, non-like-that behaviors."
1916680,1917680," Behavors."
1917680,1920680," There are some standout companies that don't behave like that."
1920680,1922680," Ones that come to mind."
1922680,1925680," EVGA, although they were much more challenging to deal with"
1925680,1926680," as a retailer than as a consumer."
1926680,1928680," I will tell you guys that much."
1928680,1929680," Corsair."
1929680,1932680," Corsair basically had a blanket policy with us,"
1932680,1935680," put it on a pallet, send it back to us."
1935680,1939680," My understanding, I've heard just small rumblings."
1939680,1941680," It started very small."
1941680,1944680," I've heard rumblings that it might not be that easy with them anymore,"
1944680,1951680," but overall they've had a really pro-consumer approach to taking care of"
1951680,1954680," warranty issues and support issues during the time that I've worked with them,"
1954680,1956680," which is a long time."
1956680,1957680," Logitech."
1957680,1962680," Logitech has basically a legendary reputation when it comes to replacements."
1962680,1966680," My understanding, again, is more recently they've had some quality issues"
1966680,1970680," and people have had to do more RMA's, but they've still been really good about"
1970680,1972680," communication, getting stuff back to you."
1972680,1977680," Are there any that you know of that just have spotless reputations?"
1977680,1978680," Noctua."
1978680,1979680," Noctua is one floatplane chat."
1979680,1980680," Yeah, 100%."
1980680,1982680," I would only want to speak from my own experience."
1982680,1983680," Yeah, for sure."
1983680,1984680," It's just EVGA."
1984680,1989680," That EVGA call was one of the most insane things."
1989680,1993680," That level of customer support was so insanely above and beyond."
1993680,1998680," I just don't know."
1998680,2000680," I will always be friendly towards their customer support unless it's drastically changed,"
2000680,2004680," which from what I've heard from the community, it hasn't."
2004680,2007680," Every time I talk about EVGA customer support, everybody's like,"
2007680,2008680," \"Yeah, they're great.\""
2008680,2013680," So, like, sounds good to me."
2013680,2018680," Yeah, a lot of really good feedback for the ones I mentioned mostly."
2018680,2021680," I'm kind of looking for other ones."
2021680,2023680," I'm looking for some good feedback for HyperX."
2023680,2024680," That's good to know."
2024680,2026680," We haven't actually worked with HyperX in a long time."
2026680,2027680," Oh, one time we used to all the time."
2027680,2028680," Yeah."
2028680,2029680," Yeah."
2029680,2030680," I wonder if Brian's still there."
2030680,2031680," I should email him."
2031680,2033680," Be like, \"Hey, are you tired of sponsoring e-sports teams?"
2033680,2036680," Maybe we want to come back to tech media?\""
2036680,2038680," That was basically the whole thing."
2038680,2042680," We were still chill, but they were just like, \"Yeah, we're spending all our money on e-sports.\""
2042680,2043680," Doing e-sports teams now."
2043680,2044680," Fair enough."
2044680,2047680," Don't think it went super well."
2047680,2054680," So, almost everybody, 70% are saying NA or never dealt with."
2054680,2059680," Then it goes 7% did like 1 as in low."
2059680,2060680," I've got it up now."
2060680,2061680," Yeah, you can see it."
2061680,2062680," Yeah."
2062680,2064680," The majority of it's never dealt with."
2064680,2067680," And then it's like pretty even distribution except for 5."
2067680,2069680," Very few people said it was like 5."
2069680,2070680," Like outstanding."
2070680,2071680," Yeah, very, very few."
2071680,2073680," The rest of it is pretty even all the way through."
2073680,2076680," I think this needs to be a big wake-up call for them."
2076680,2079680," Yeah, that's not great."
2079680,2080680," I wonder, I wonder."
2080680,2081680," Ooh, no."
2081680,2083680," I don't actually want to pit them against each other."
2083680,2091680," But like, I bet you there's a few companies we could throw in there with the exact same poll that would score a lot better."
2091680,2096680," Yeah, I mean, I think if we threw like a Logitech or an EVGA in there, they'd probably score a lot better."
2096680,2099680," But here's an interesting one."
2099680,2101680," And this is something that's frustrated me for years."
2101680,2103680," In fact, I think I've even talked about on WAN Show."
2103680,2108680," If I put any other motherboard manufacturer in there, would the story be any different?"
2108680,2109680," No, that's interesting."
2109680,2111680," That's actually very interesting."
2111680,2112680," Yeah."
2112680,2113680," Yeah."
2113680,2116680," Literally, universally."
2116680,2125680," I've had and seen anecdotally very mediocre at best experiences with literally all of them."
2125680,2131680," And I can see some of the factors that might contribute to that."
2131680,2141680," They have so many SKUs, sometimes with very little variation, but so many SKUs across all these different regions, they are actually very complicated products."
2141680,2142680," Yes."
2142680,2147680," And they deal with a lot of users that are not necessarily particularly experienced."
2147680,2149680," So the volume of support."
2149680,2154680," And that will like genuinely poke at or prod or crank things on motherboards all the time."
2154680,2157680," [sighs]"
2157680,2159680," Yeah, that's tough."
2159680,2165680," I wonder if needing to unscrew things and screw things back in for M.2 drives has increased failure rates."
2165680,2167680," That's a good question."
2167680,2168680," It wouldn't surprise me."
2168680,2171680," I can see people cranking an M.2 too tight."
2171680,2173680," The thing is that wouldn't go back to the motherboard maker."
2173680,2176680," That would probably go back to the SSD manufacturer though."
2176680,2180680," They'd be sitting there going like, \"Why is it that every time someone installs them?\""
2180680,2184680," Well, no, because every board was using metal screws for the longest time."
2184680,2187680," Yeah, this is tough."
2187680,2195680," Yeah, full plane chat now lighting up with people just saying, \"Yeah, you know, the one positive one.\""
2195680,2196680," Oh, this is great."
2196680,2201680," I'm Victor says, \"Have you seen any complaints about ECS or Foxconn motherboards in a while?\""
2201680,2203680," Yeah, I get it."
2203680,2208680," \"Have you seen an ECS or a Foxconn motherboard in a while?\""
2208680,2214680," Let me tell you though, when they were around, they were not perfect."
2214680,2218680," Oh, man."
2218680,2223680," Yeah, so tough situation, but here's what I will..."
2223680,2226680," Here's my final word on the subject."
2226680,2231680," Hey, Sous, in good faith, we still want to continue to work with you."
2231680,2233680," We need to see you improve this."
2233680,2235680," Yeah, this is rough."
2235680,2236680," Yeah."
2236680,2237680," Fix."
2237680,2238680," You know what's not rough?"
2238680,2241680," If you guys want to interact with the show, you know what the way to do it is?"
2241680,2244680," Leave a merch message just like down here."
2244680,2246680," You don't want to send a super chat."
2246680,2247680," You don't want to send Twitch bits."
2247680,2252680," Why are you just throwing money at the screen when you could be throwing money at SickNewMerch"
2252680,2254680," from LTTStore.com?"
2254680,2258680," To send a merch message, all you got to do is fill up that cart, head to the checkout,"
2258680,2261680," and you're going to see a box called \"Merch Messages.\""
2261680,2264680," I mean, you should put some text in the box."
2264680,2265680," That would be a good idea."
2265680,2266680," It's a good idea."
2266680,2269680," When you do, you'll get a little shout out down here."
2269680,2271680," You might get a response from producer Dan."
2271680,2274680," You might get a response from someone else after."
2274680,2275680," Is that workflow implemented?"
2275680,2276680," Yeah."
2276680,2277680," That flow is implemented?"
2277680,2278680," Apparently."
2278680,2279680," Yeah."
2279680,2282680," We can create a support ticket directly and support will get back to you."
2282680,2283680," Sick."
2283680,2284680," Okay."
2284680,2285680," I mean."
2285680,2288680," It's possible if we can't answer your questions like about an order or something like that,"
2288680,2298680," that especially has to do with the LTTStore support, we can forward that on to them and they can deal with it next week when they come into the office, which is cool because instead of just giving you like a garbage like a garbage ticket,"
2298680,2303680," you can actually get some action on it."
2303680,2304680," Wow."
2304680,2305680," Shots fired."
2305680,2306680," What?"
2306680,2308680," You called Dan's, I don't know, sorry, responses garbage."
2308680,2309680," Oh."
2309680,2310680," Yeah."
2310680,2311680," I mean, I've done them too."
2311680,2312680," I can do better."
2312680,2315680," If we can't appropriately address your problem, then it's not good."
2315680,2318680," So now we can appropriately address your problem, which is good."
2318680,2327680," The final option is that if you send something particularly interesting that we have never covered before, then we might address it later on the show in \"When Show After Dark.\""
2327680,2331680," Now you're probably wondering, \"Ff, LTTStore.com.\""
2331680,2334680," What could they possibly carry that I would be interested in?"
2334680,2336680," And let me tell you."
2336680,2343680," I'm so excited because we haven't really hyped this up that much in the lead up to our launch."
2343680,2347680," This has been relatively quiet, but they're finally here."
2347680,2348680," Producer Dan, do you want to man the camera?"
2348680,2349680," Oh boy."
2349680,2350680," Okay."
2353680,2359680," Sticklocks! They're finally here. Silicon joystick covers."
2359680,2361680," Cool."
2361680,2364680," There you go."
2364680,2366680," Are they universal?"
2366680,2367680," Yes."
2367680,2368680," Wow."
2368680,2374680," Sticklocks are designed to reduce the horizontal force applied to your joysticks when traveling with a controller or console."
2374680,2379680," They are small, convenient, and can be installed and removed in seconds."
2379680,2395680," We spent a ton of time on the geometry for these, getting it absolutely nailed so that it fits on everything from the Nintendo Switch, all the way to the Steam Deck and full-sized desktop class controllers."
2395680,2408680," It's super flexible, but hard enough that it's not going to kind of pull on things when you are sliding a controller or sliding a console in or out of your bag."
2408680,2415680," I am so, so excited to launch these and Luke, have you ever touched them?"
2415680,2417680," Have you touched Sticks Locks yet?"
2417680,2418680," Okay, cool."
2418680,2421680," Here is a box of Sticks Locks."
2421680,2424680," Here is a Nintendo Switch."
2424680,2426680," Steam Deck."
2426680,2429680," Nintendo Pro Controller."
2429680,2432680," Xbox Controller."
2432680,2433680," Dual Sense."
2433680,2434680," Okay."
2434680,2436680," Pick, I don't know, two. I don't care."
2436680,2440680," Pick however many you want, and let's get you to install some Sticks Locks."
2440680,2442680," Okay, now you guys, I'm going to brief you once."
2442680,2446680," Just at the very beginning, Dan is not going to try to follow Luke around."
2446680,2448680," He's just going to aim there."
2448680,2450680," Luke, keep the thing there."
2450680,2452680," Oops, that's not what I meant to click."
2452680,2454680," Okay, there we go."
2454680,2455680," I like that. It's cheeky."
2455680,2456680," It's good."
2456680,2457680," You might have to read it for the people."
2457680,2462680," You look really smart, but here's an installation guide if you need it."
2462680,2463680," Cool."
2463680,2464680," And then it shows all the things it's compatible with, I guess."
2464680,2468680," PlayStation 2 controller, PlayStation DualShock 3 controller, PlayStation DualShock 4 controller,"
2468680,2472680," PlayStation DualSense controller, Xbox controller, Nintendo GameCube controller,"
2472680,2475680," and Valve Steam Deck, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch Pro controller."
2475680,2477680," Now, there is one asterisk there."
2477680,2482680," The PlayStation 2 controller we actually found is a little bit more hit or miss."
2482680,2487680," So the site has been updated in advance of the launch."
2487680,2491680," But you'll have seen the site before you see the packaging."
2491680,2493680," So I think it's fine."
2493680,2495680," Okay, let's see if you can handle it."
2495680,2497680," These are going to end up being fidget toys."
2497680,2498680," I know."
2498680,2499680," They're fun."
2499680,2500680," Just making sure you guys are aware."
2500680,2502680," I would recommend, you know what?"
2502680,2506680," I'm going to let you try and figure it out because this is no offense."
2506680,2509680," This is an average user here that I'm..."
2509680,2510680," Wow."
2510680,2511680," Okay."
2511680,2512680," It's a little generally."
2512680,2514680," Hold that up for the camera."
2514680,2516680," Oh, jeez."
2516680,2518680," Like I said, average user."
2518680,2523680," You can see it on here and I can like do that."
2523680,2524680," But more pressure on it."
2524680,2525680," Come on."
2525680,2526680," It's a stick lock."
2526680,2527680," That's the whole point."
2527680,2528680," And it..."
2528680,2529680," Oh, that's kind of cool."
2529680,2531680," So if I do get it to move by putting like a..."
2531680,2532680," You can see my finger."
2532680,2533680," I'm putting quite a bit of pressure on there."
2533680,2534680," It goes back."
2534680,2535680," Cool, right."
2535680,2537680," Kind of pushes itself back a little bit."
2537680,2538680," Yeah."
2538680,2539680," That's sweet."
2539680,2540680," Yeah."
2540680,2541680," Is this how you're supposed to do it?"
2541680,2542680," No, not really."
2542680,2543680," [laughs]"
2543680,2546680," I mean..."
2546680,2549680," It is a two-hand operation."
2549680,2550680," There's got to..."
2550680,2551680," That is a thing."
2551680,2553680," Like we really did..."
2553680,2557680," We really did try to make it something that you could one hand."
2557680,2559680," It did end up being a two-hand thing."
2559680,2561680," I personally find that the fastest way,"
2561680,2563680," I'm just going to come back out to the wide cam for a second here."
2563680,2564680," You just squish it over top."
2564680,2565680," I've got my own pack of sticks."
2565680,2566680," Without it and burning."
2566680,2569680," So the way that I like to do it, here, I'll take it."
2569680,2570680," Yeah, sure."
2570680,2571680," Is..."
2571680,2572680," Oh, where somewhere that you guys can actually see?"
2572680,2574680," Oh, good gravy."
2574680,2577680," Okay, the way that I like to do it is I do the two thumb method,"
2577680,2579680," put it on the stick."
2579680,2581680," This is really hard to do while I'm also hosting,"
2581680,2582680," and then I put it on like that."
2582680,2585680," So I'll get the two thumbs in there to kind of spread it open"
2585680,2588680," and then get it over the..."
2588680,2589680," Really?"
2589680,2590680," What's wrong with you?"
2590680,2591680," [laughs]"
2591680,2594680," I'll get it over the joystick."
2594680,2597680," Why don't you actually, instead of doing the Steam Deck,"
2597680,2600680," which is basically like the same as the..."
2600680,2601680," Oh, oh, actually, yeah."
2601680,2602680," Leave those installed."
2602680,2603680," Leave those installed."
2603680,2604680," Really good."
2604680,2607680," So here's the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller."
2607680,2609680," Okay, see if you can do the Switch."
2609680,2611680," No, no, the Switch."
2611680,2613680," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
2613680,2615680," Okay, let's get..."
2615680,2617680," Okay."
2617680,2623680," Finding something that was possible to install on everything"
2623680,2630680," from low profile to full-sized joysticks was really challenging."
2630680,2633680," This is one of those products that we conceived a very, very,"
2633680,2636680," very, very, very, very, very, very long time ago,"
2636680,2640680," and then took forever to actually get right,"
2640680,2643680," but we're really, really proud of the result."
2643680,2645680," So it is a little bit more challenging to get onto the Switch,"
2645680,2647680," but it totally goes on there."
2647680,2648680," I thought it is here."
2648680,2649680," Really?"
2649680,2650680," All right, well..."
2650680,2652680," Those were both like instant..."
2652680,2653680," You're also..."
2653680,2655680," The first way I was doing it was also really bad."
2655680,2657680," I don't think I'm doing it the same way you do,"
2657680,2658680," because I couldn't see your demonstration,"
2658680,2660680," but the new I'm doing it is way better."
2660680,2663680," You're also more practiced at it now, so that's probably a factor."
2663680,2664680," Yes, I do too."
2664680,2665680," Yeah."
2665680,2666680," So do you want to just show..."
2666680,2671680," Okay, the last thing I want to show is how it sits more proud on the Steam Deck"
2671680,2673680," compared to on the Switch controller."
2673680,2674680," There you go."
2674680,2677680," So you can see how the way the geometry is designed,"
2677680,2682680," it can flatten out more or it can stand more tent-like,"
2682680,2685680," and either way it prevents the stick from moving."
2685680,2687680," Do you want to just give the sticks a little wiggle?"
2687680,2688680," Or try?"
2688680,2689680," You can try."
2689680,2690680," I'm moving the whole..."
2690680,2693680," That's clearly in place, and then this one is also in place."
2693680,2694680," It is slick too."
2694680,2695680," I was doing this earlier."
2695680,2697680," I pulled that one off, but it is..."
2697680,2698680," Oh, okay."
2698680,2700680," Bob, that make sure it was on there."
2700680,2701680," I don't want..."
2701680,2702680," If it's bad, we got to pull it."
2702680,2703680," We got to pull the product."
2703680,2707680," Mr. I found it so much easier to put on the Switch."
2707680,2708680," It is a little..."
2708680,2709680," Okay."
2709680,2712680," I find it a little more challenging to put on the Switch, personally."
2712680,2714680," I thought I had it."
2714680,2716680," It might have been how I pushed at it."
2716680,2717680," There we go."
2717680,2719680," But yeah, they're slick."
2719680,2722680," You're mentioning you put it in your bag, and it should actually be fine."
2722680,2729680," Because it will slide along materials, especially if you have an LTT bag that has the soft touch"
2729680,2730680," material."
2730680,2731680," It will slide right along there."
2731680,2733680," Screen safe material, I think we call it on the product page."
2733680,2734680," Yeah."
2734680,2736680," I'm so excited."
2736680,2738680," Stick locks are finally here."
2738680,2740680," We're absolutely jazzed for them."
2740680,2742680," We've got some really great questions."
2742680,2745680," I had someone asking, \"Hey, does this help with stick drinks?\""
2745680,2747680," You know what?"
2747680,2752680," Unfortunately, it's not something that we can scientifically test with the equipment that"
2752680,2753680," we have today."
2753680,2760680," But what we do know is that if something is moving around in your bag or getting caught"
2760680,2763680," on anything, that is probably not good for it."
2763680,2768680," And we know that people have been looking for a way to keep their sticks in place, whether"
2768680,2772680," it's a case, whether it's some kind of lock, and now there is a thing."
2772680,2775680," People ask for removal the way I would do it."
2775680,2777680," I don't know if you're supposed to, but I would like brace it on one side."
2777680,2780680," Here, I'm going to go back to Luke's camera and just hold it up."
2780680,2781680," Yeah, we don't need to end the bag."
2781680,2785680," I would brace it on one side and then peel up the opposite side."
2785680,2786680," Is that what you do?"
2786680,2790680," No, I actually two-handed again, so going back to the wide."
2790680,2793680," So I would typically just put my thumb in the middle."
2793680,2794680," Hold on."
2794680,2795680," Just a sec."
2795680,2798680," Wow, it's actually really hard to get off this one."
2798680,2799680," I'm going to do the real."
2799680,2806680," So what I would typically do is get under it like this to get under one of the legs and"
2806680,2810680," then put my finger on the joystick straight down and then pull it up."
2810680,2814080," So that way you can get it off without moving the stick around and putting a ton of pressure"
2814080,2815080," on it."
2815080,2819880," So I will typically go thumbs to invert it, stick it on like that, get under one of the"
2819880,2822680," legs, press it down in the middle and pull it off like that."
2822680,2823680," Good to go."
2823680,2825680," Freaking excited."
2825680,2826680," Cool."
2826680,2827680," Yeah, these took a long time."
2827680,2831680," I got $14.99 and that gives you a pack of four."
2831680,2832680," Hey, Dan."
2832680,2834680," Probably you forgot water today."
2834680,2835680," Oh, no."
2835680,2836680," Yeah, absolutely."
2836680,2837680," I need some water."
2837680,2838680," Thank you."
2838680,2839680," You can pick your own merch messages to read."
2839680,2840680," Oh, okay."
2840680,2841680," We're supposed to do three merch messages."
2841680,2842680," I'll read."
2842680,2843680," Two."
2843680,2845680," We're supposed to do two merch messages."
2845680,2850680," I got to scroll all the way down to the curators."
2850680,2851680," Okay."
2851680,2855680," I use the WAN Despad at my repair shop counter and I'm always getting asked, \"Where can I"
2855680,2856680," get one?"
2856680,2857680," Are you considered slash?"
2857680,2862080," Would you sell to small businesses for retail release?\""
2862080,2863080," This is from Robert H."
2863080,2868440," I mean, yeah, no one's ever asked."
2868440,2871440," Like you'd be, you would, well, I shouldn't even say no one's ever asked."
2871440,2874680," I mean, we've tried with some of our products."
2874680,2880360," Like I joked in that micro center sponsored video when we were down there fixing XQC's"
2880360,2881360," computer."
2881360,2882920," I was, I was joking with the rep."
2882920,2885600," I was like, \"Mm, why don't you guys carry the LTT screwdriver?\""
2885600,2887800," Because we've actually, like we've reached out to them."
2887800,2890400," We've been like, \"Hey, you guys should carry the LTT screwdriver.\""
2890400,2892720," And they're, I don't know what exactly is going on."
2892720,2897600," I don't know if they're just dragging butt or whatever else, but nothing's ever happened."
2897600,2898640," Seems like a good idea."
2898640,2903760," I know that we've reached out to more than one retailer about carrying the ABCs of gaming"
2903760,2906800," and just hasn't really worked out."
2906800,2907800," I don't know."
2907800,2909000," It's confusing to me."
2909000,2910000," Sure."
2910000,2911000," Let me know."
2911000,2913200," Slide into my DMs."
2913200,2919440," I mean, obviously, I think it's going to be, I think there's going to be some challenges"
2919440,2921920," for extremely small resellers."
2921920,2925560," Like if you're asking, can you, can you order two mouse pads?"
2925560,2932320," That's, that's honestly not much higher order volume than a user."
2932320,2936200," So I could, I could see us having some kind of like minimum order quantity or something"
2936200,2937200," to set it."
2937200,2942200," I guess we don't really have any infrastructure for reseller accounts."
2942200,2946240," But we're working on, we're working on quantity discounts, right?"
2946240,2949640," For the, for the bit selector."
2949640,2950640," Ah."
2950640,2951640," Yep."
2951640,2953280," So maybe we could reuse some of that logic."
2953280,2954840," So you want to just baked into the normal store though?"
2954840,2955840," Is that normal?"
2955840,2956840," Is that, I don't think that's-"
2956840,2957840," Well, some stores do."
2957840,2959120," Like my master car has that."
2959120,2964280," Yeah, that's a very industrial thing though."
2964280,2969200," That's like an industrial thing that happens to also sell to individuals."
2969200,2970200," You can do the whole thing."
2970200,2971680," You should just send it."
2971680,2972680," Whole bottle."
2972680,2973680," No."
2973680,2975960," Would you like another?"
2975960,2980320," If only we sold, if only we sold larger water bottles."
2980320,2983880," I carry my 64 ounce literally everywhere."
2983880,2984880," But anyways."
2984880,2985880," Yeah."
2985880,2986880," I don't know."
2986880,2987880," One more."
2987880,2988880," Yeah."
2988880,2989880," I mean, if another please."
2989880,2990880," One more."
2990880,2992520," Oh, I meant more water, but yeah, sure."
2992520,2993520," Let's see."
2993520,2994520," Which one did you read?"
2994520,2995960," Let's pick just one at random."
2995960,3000760," What challenges have the float plane dev teams overcome this week?"
3000760,3001760," This week?"
3001760,3003600," This week?"
3003600,3006400," How about what challenges have they overcome today?"
3006400,3008600," That's a shorter list."
3008600,3009600," Yeah."
3009600,3011080," But still probably too long for Wanshow."
3011080,3013120," We're back to six hour Wanshow."
3013120,3015920," Yeah, I could send it."
3015920,3022760," Yeah, so I think this week was largely, we got all of the features that we want to have"
3022760,3026560," on the beta site, on to the beta site last week."
3026560,3029800," So now we're going through and doing like clean up."
3029800,3032520," So there was bug fixes to have to have."
3032520,3035760," There was there was a couple of hot fixes that were pushed this week."
3035760,3040360," There was also some, some things pushed from, from Jaden and another person that I haven't"
3040360,3043440," actually asked if he's cool with me saying his name on stream yet."
3043440,3048800," So I will not say his name, but from another person kind of cleaning up some of the payments"
3048800,3051960," upgrade downgrade stuff that we pushed last week."
3051960,3054400," So it's a, it's a little bit more bug free now."
3054400,3059640," There are still some problems with it, including some of the logic for upgrading and downgrading"
3059640,3065920," which we're going to be changing a little bit and increasing transparency of the user on,"
3065920,3071400," on when and why and how they can or cannot do that."
3071400,3073720," Just because we don't want any confusion there."
3073720,3077280," We want it to be very obvious what limitations there are."
3077280,3078600," So some changes there."
3078600,3084880," But once those changes are done, we're basically done with that big push."
3084880,3088920," So the beta will stop being a beta and it will just be the main site."
3088920,3094560," The original aim for that was, was this week, but then there was some additional work that"
3094560,3099600," I wanted to get done in relation to payment upgrade downgrade."
3099600,3105840," So we're going to finish those off and then, and then we'll try to send it."
3105840,3106840," Yeah."
3106840,3107840," Okay."
3107840,3110200," Let's, let's see if we can knock out a couple rapid fires here."
3110200,3114120," We're going to about a minute left or so in this segment."
3114120,3115120," Let's see."
3115120,3117040," Oh, this is going to be a spicy one."
3117040,3120800," If aces doesn't fix things to satisfaction, does pulling sponsorship deals include the"
3120800,3122560," LTX 2023 headline sponsorship?"
3122560,3123560," Yeah, of course."
3123560,3126200," I've already talked a little bit about it."
3126200,3127200," Got them."
3127200,3128200," Yeah."
3128200,3129200," Rapid fire."
3129200,3130200," Are you guys are getting better at this?"
3130200,3131200," Let's see."
3131200,3133800," Hey, LLD for Linus wondering if basketball shorts are a thing."
3133800,3134800," Actually, you know what?"
3134800,3136960," No, I'm not done talking about that crap."
3136960,3137960," Yeah."
3137960,3138960," Okay."
3138960,3139960," Long show."
3139960,3142400," Long show."
3142400,3149640," He's rescinded."
3149640,3156920," What have I, what have I ever done in the past to make people doubt that?"
3156920,3161960," For real though, you do have to wonder like you don't necessarily know how long this person"
3161960,3163120," has been watching."
3163120,3164120," I guess."
3164120,3167760," How much they've, they've viewed this could be a new viewer."
3167760,3169080," Yeah, I guess."
3169080,3173960," They might just be someone who doesn't watch Wanc, so it doesn't go fluff."
3173960,3178160," If you don't watch Wanc, and you don't go on Reddit, nothing really happens."
3178160,3179480," Yeah, I guess that's true."
3179480,3180480," Probably fine."
3180480,3186680," We do, we do keep the, the mainline content pretty just evergreen is, is, is the word"
3186680,3193240," that we try not to, we try not to have too many, you know, wink, winks, current controversy."
3193240,3194240," Yeah."
3194240,3199040," Uh, because we want our videos to be still, even if the part numbers of everything involved"
3199040,3200880," aren't that relevant."
3200880,3205760," We want the learning outcomes and we want the overall vibe to be just as fun two years,"
3205760,3209320," three years, five years down the road as they are the day that they're released."
3209320,3214520," Um, so yeah, we do tend to keep current events out of them to a degree anyway."
3214520,3216120," Um, and so yeah, okay."
3216120,3223080," I guess you're right, but we have, we have publicly dunked on our sponsors over and over"
3223080,3230280," and over again, and we have publicly broken up with sponsors who have not done right by"
3230280,3231280," our community."
3231280,3236480," Um, just trying to think of some of the most, the most notable ones."
3236480,3242000," Um, well, we dumped Tunnel Bear when they got acquired by someone shady."
3242000,3243000," Yep."
3243000,3244000," Um, we."
3244000,3245240," There was some clothing brand."
3245240,3248120," Um, we didn't publicly dump five four."
3248120,3249120," Okay."
3249120,3250520," We quietly dumped five four."
3250520,3252920," Again, that was related to customer service issues."
3252920,3256760," I don't know if they're around anymore, but they, it was hard to basically, there were"
3256760,3257760," two main issues."
3257760,3262160," I think the one that, that broke the camel's back was, so there were two things."
3262160,3266000," One was we had, we got some complaints from viewers that didn't get dealt with in a timely"
3266000,3267040," manner."
3267040,3272720," And then the second one, the one that actually caused us to go, okay, this, this has to end"
3272720,3275400," because they could have still just made it right by those customers and that would have"
3275400,3276640," been fixed."
3276640,3281280," But the one that ultimately killed it was that it was kind of hard to cancel your subscription"
3281280,3282280," or something."
3282280,3283760," And we were like, Hey, you need to fix this."
3283760,3284760," Yeah."
3284760,3285760," And then they didn't."
3285760,3286760," Yeah."
3286760,3287760," Um, so then we didn't work with them anymore."
3287760,3288760," Five four still exists."
3288760,3293000," They're a holding co of other intermittent shipping fashion brands."
3293000,3294000," All right."
3294000,3295000," Good for them."
3295000,3296000," Yeah, sure."
3296000,3297000," Um, yeah."
3297000,3299880," So, so, I mean, those are, those are a couple of couple notable examples."
3299880,3305760," I mean, obviously there was the, um, the anchor thing recently with the U.F.E. security"
3305760,3308920," cameras that were more like U.F.E. and security cameras."
3308920,3312640," Yeah, an insecurity camera."
3312640,3313640," My goodness."
3313640,3314640," What would that be?"
3314640,3319040," So it has an automatic filter that adds 25 pounds or what?"
3319040,3326560," Like it's specifically starts automatic recording when you're like heart rate jumps."
3326560,3329520," Do you want memories of when you were like distressed?"
3329520,3332240," Uh, oh, yeah."
3332240,3333680," Plex is on pause right now."
3333680,3334680," Still love Plex."
3334680,3335680," Still love the product."
3335680,3339880," You want to use it still want to resume the relationship, but there are some key things"
3339880,3344920," that I need to see fixed before, before we're able to move forward."
3344920,3350760," Um, yeah, I mean, that's the way that we can put pressure, right?"
3350760,3357080," That's kind of that's the way we do it because we think that there is a huge benefit to a"
3357080,3362120," relationship with us to marketing with us, but there's a certain bar you have to meet"
3362120,3366120," and that bar is only going to continue to get higher as we rely on the lab to evaluate"
3366120,3367840," our sponsors more and more."
3367840,3372360," It's something that is not in full swing yet, but as we continue to build up the team there,"
3372360,3375640," it's going to happen."
3375640,3378520," All right."
3378520,3380360," Two more topics."
3380360,3382280," Oh, yeah."
3382280,3385080," What do you want to talk about?"
3385080,3386080," Google I/O?"
3386080,3387080," Sure."
3387080,3390480," Google held their I/O developer conference this week."
3390480,3395680," The presentation primarily focused on Google's ethical approach in quotes and integration"
3395680,3402360," of AI into its entire workspace suite, composition, assistance in Gmail, Google Docs, et cetera,"
3402360,3407320," ability to use text prompts to create draft spreadsheets and images and slides."
3407320,3412360," Bar can handle 20 programming languages and will likewise use Docs, maps, lens, et cetera"
3412360,3417400," as tools, similar to chat GPT's plugins, which I'm not going to make a whole topic about"
3417400,3422920," it, but they announced will be usable by anyone who subscribes next week, including"
3422920,3425920," chat GPT, BPL to search the web and all this other kind of stuff."
3425920,3427680," So cool."
3427680,3434320," Google also demoed Google search with an AI snapshot included at the top of search results,"
3434320,3440560," which could serve as a jumping off point for further AI powered actions on a Bing."
3440560,3444080," There's a wait list to access this feature unsurprisingly because that's how everything's"
3444080,3447520," working right now, which is part of search labs."
3447520,3453800," Google introduced the future project tailwind, not to be confused with tailwind, which will"
3453800,3459120," be a personalized private AI model that learns from your documents and acts as a tutor and"
3459120,3460720," research assistant."
3460720,3465480," This is similar to their vertex AI division, which will let businesses build custom AI"
3465480,3470680," tools with their choice of model like palm to image in, et cetera."
3470680,3476400," Starting with character AI, a service that creates custom chatbots with different personalities,"
3476400,3481320," even once based off celebrities, there's a chick on TikTok or something that is selling"
3481320,3485560," access to her AI, which pretends to be your girlfriend for $1 a minute."
3485560,3487320," Yeah, I saw that crazy."
3487320,3493960," Google is supporting their rhetoric about ethical AI development with concrete features."
3493960,3496600," Metadagging for meta tagging for AI images."
3496600,3500440," I mean, that's a concrete feature assuming that they actually do it and assuming that"
3500440,3502120," it's actually accurate."
3502120,3508400," The second one, pretty big ability to spot and highlight potential malicious code."
3508400,3513000," You can say what Linus just said yet again, additional context to allow users to spot"
3513000,3518640," misinformation such as notes on an image that show where and when it was posted on the internet."
3518640,3523840," A universal translator who's dubbing and lip syncing are available only to authorize partners"
3523840,3528680," to prevent defects that will definitely work and never have any problems."
3528680,3531560," More announcements were relatively unsurprising."
3531560,3533840," The Pixel Fold was exactly as leaked."
3533840,3534840," Surprise, surprise."
3534840,3539160," The Pixel tablet supports multiple users and can double as a nest hub."
3539160,3540240," That's actually kind of neat."
3540240,3544880," The Pixel 7A is very similar to the 6A with modest improvements in most areas."
3544880,3547760," Notably, its refresh rate has gone from 60 to 90."
3547760,3549240," That's actually pretty nice."
3549240,3556200," Its main camera has a 72% bigger sensor and has a significant jump in resolution, 12.2"
3556200,3558640," megapixels to 64 megapixels."
3558640,3562600," Discussion question, what is the value of a company like Google emphasizing thoughtful"
3562600,3566760," ethical approach to AI?"
3566760,3570480," I mean, it's only as good as their commitment."
3570480,3572880," Yeah, it means nothing right now."
3572880,3576360," And Google's commitment to anything is..."
3576360,3577600," Very questionable."
3577600,3578600," Very questionable."
3578600,3582000," I mean, I talked about this on that stream that we pulled down earlier this week."
3582000,3585520," Oh, I guess I should probably explain that at some point."
3585520,3592320," I talked about this on the stream, but the biggest issue for me with Google's tablets,"
3592320,3595960," and it was tablets that I was focused on when I was talking about it on the stream,"
3595960,3598240," is that I just..."
3598240,3600440," What do you need to do on a tablet?"
3600440,3601440," Right?"
3601440,3602440," What?"
3602440,3603440," No, really?"
3603440,3604440," Like what?"
3604440,3605880," I never use them."
3605880,3606880," So I don't know."
3606880,3607880," Watch YouTube or something?"
3607880,3608880," Yeah."
3608880,3609880," I mean, that was the number one response."
3609880,3613680," Yeah, like watching YouTube Netflix, something like that."
3613680,3615920," I'm going to email, browse the web."
3615920,3616920," Sure."
3616920,3619240," I find responding to email on a tablet very annoying, but like..."
3619240,3621000," Yeah, some people do it."
3621000,3622000," Well, remember, like..."
3622000,3625360," I don't know, the way some people reply to emails, like, \"Okay.\""
3625360,3628400," They use email as instant messaging, right?"
3628400,3629400," Yeah, yeah."
3629400,3635480," Yeah, but browse the web and watch video where the number one and number two responses,"
3635480,3641200," is there any reason that you couldn't do that on an Android tablet?"
3641200,3642200," Nope."
3642200,3643640," No, of course not."
3643640,3649160," So then why does everyone buy iPads?"
3649160,3652520," Because there's continuity in the ecosystem."
3652520,3658200," Because you know that when your iPad cracks the screen or gets old, there's a new one"
3658200,3663520," that will work just like the old one and all your stuff works and you're good to go immediately."
3663520,3669440," In my experience, a lot of apps on Android tablets are super janky and terrible."
3669440,3670840," The experience is just kind of rough."
3670840,3673120," Like, everyone I know that buys one is like, \"Yeah, this thing sucks.\""
3673120,3674120," Well, that's because Google's..."
3674120,3680400," Again, because Google's commitment to Android tablets has been lackluster."
3680400,3681720," So they're not creating..."
3681720,3686200," They're not signaling the importance of the category by supporting it properly."
3686200,3688520," They're not encouraging developers."
3688520,3693440," They're not getting hardware out there at an affordable price in a way that will incentivize"
3693440,3695680," developers for the platform."
3695680,3700920," And for consumers, they're not giving them the trust that if they buy an Android tablet,"
3700920,3703600," it will be supported for a reasonable amount of time."
3703600,3708000," And once it reaches a reasonable end of life, there'll be a new one for them to transition"
3708000,3709000," to."
3709000,3714840," And so I think for me, the biggest question is what's the follow through going to be?"
3714840,3720840," And back to the whole metadata tagging on AI-generated images and all that sort of thing."
3720840,3725440," What about when AI is not the Silicon Valley word du jour?"
3725440,3728280," What if we go back to Internet of Things?"
3728280,3729280," Yeah."
3729280,3731680," Remember Internet of Things?"
3731680,3732680," Yeah."
3732680,3734880," I mean, what are some other stupid cringe?"
3734880,3738720," I mean, obviously, Metaverse was the most recent one before AI."
3738720,3740600," Web 3.0."
3740600,3746920," What happens when we move on to the next trendy thing that everyone wants in their quarterly"
3746920,3751720," earnings calls and in their new product announcements, right?"
3751720,3753840," Do they just kind of say, \"Oh, I don't know."
3753840,3755920," Everyone seems to be kind of over this AI thing and move on.\""
3755920,3756920," I don't..."
3756920,3758800," I just don't know."
3758800,3764400," What product has Google successfully launched in the last five years?"
3764400,3766880," No really though, guys, for real."
3766880,3769840," If I'm way off base here, you've got to let me know."
3769840,3774200," So I'm trying to think of like what I use."
3774200,3775200," Meat isn't new."
3775200,3777760," I use meat all the time."
3777760,3782640," They like changed the name a billion times, but it's still just meat."
3782640,3785880," Google workspace, Google search."
3785880,3786880," Pixel phone?"
3786880,3787880," Dude, no."
3787880,3793960," He's talking about new verticals, not individual product."
3793960,3798880," He's not saying like releasing the eighth pixel doesn't count."
3798880,3803520," Yeah, like an update to Android Auto is not releasing a product."
3803520,3805840," Although shout out Android Auto."
3805840,3808200," It sort of is, but he means new verticals."
3808200,3812880," Yeah, but the Pixel also hasn't been in the last five years, guys."
3812880,3813880," Stadia."
3813880,3816880," Stadia is not a successful launch."
3816880,3820360," I mean, what is it?"
3820360,3822360," It's a successful launch with a..."
3822360,3823360," Comcast is very old, guys."
3823360,3826080," Some spontaneous rapid deconstruction."
3826080,3828720," What's the term for it when you launch something and it blows up?"
3828720,3829720," Is it Spud?"
3829720,3830720," I think so."
3830720,3831720," Sorry?"
3831720,3832720," Spud, I think."
3832720,3836160," No, no, I'm talking about the rocket that blew up."
3836160,3837720," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
3837720,3839600," I don't remember what the actual acronym is."
3839600,3841160," Yeah, it's not an actual acronym."
3841160,3842880," It's just like a silly thing they were saying."
3842880,3843880," No, it's a thing."
3843880,3844880," Oh, it's a thing."
3844880,3845880," Yeah."
3845880,3849560," So, Rudd, rapid unscheduled disassembly."
3849560,3850560," Disassembly."
3850560,3851560," Disassembly."
3851560,3852560," There we go."
3852560,3853560," Yeah, okay, cool."
3853560,3854560," So, I mean, yeah, I'm sorry."
3854560,3855560," You could..."
3855560,3856560," Oh, come on."
3856560,3857560," Pixel fold."
3857560,3863160," Okay, that is unproven, unproven, and you can't even buy it yet."
3863160,3864160," Wireless Android Auto."
3864160,3865680," No, that's iterative."
3865680,3867560," That's a new feature on an existing product."
3867560,3869760," See, this is what I'm talking about."
3869760,3872960," What the R&D budget that Google has?"
3872960,3875480," I'm still watching."
3875480,3878080," Pixel watch is..."
3878080,3880080," Is that not like 90% dead in the water?"
3880080,3881600," And then they just buy Fitbit?"
3881600,3887080," Like, it doesn't count if you just buy something and then..."
3887080,3890400," I don't know, I just don't get it."
3890400,3891400," It's a whole thing."
3891400,3892400," What is it?"
3892400,3895200," The innovator's dilemma or whatever it is that explains why big companies can't invent"
3895200,3896320," anything anymore?"
3896320,3897760," Because it's just..."
3897760,3900880," It's impossible because it's like not worth their time to invent things."
3900880,3901880," Yeah."
3901880,3903120," It's not worth your time to invent things."
3903120,3905040," Why do you employ so many inventors?"
3905040,3907680," Why don't you just all wear suits?"
3907680,3910600," I don't know, man."
3910600,3911600," More advertisements."
3911600,3913840," I mean, yeah, certainly that."
3913840,3915400," People asking, \"Why was the stream taken down?\""
3915400,3921520," The stream was taken down because the video did not meet our standards for quality."
3921520,3928000," And because it was an archived vaud of a live stream, there was no way to really fix"
3928000,3930480," it and make it meet our standards for quality."
3930480,3935080," It was definitely a team effort why it kind of sucked."
3935080,3938800," I want to shout out everyone who was involved in it because we all did our best to kind"
3938800,3945480," of turn this thing around extremely quickly when there were other distractions unrelated"
3945480,3951040," to the stream, unrelated to the video that were going on."
3951040,3959920," I want to thank YouTube for their patience with the way the whole thing went down because"
3959920,3964400," we pulled the video after because I was like, \"Okay, guys, here's what happened."
3964400,3969600," The first couple minutes of the stream, what was it down like three or four minutes?\""
3969600,3970600," For what?"
3970600,3971600," Sorry."
3971600,3974440," For the stream earlier this week that went to the wrong stream key."
3974440,3975440," Oh, yeah."
3975440,3978080," It was about two and a half minutes, something like that before we could figure out why."
3978080,3982120," So the first couple minutes of it went to the wrong stream key, which was a whole thing"
3982120,3987120," because we had to have it scheduled because the feature that we were supposed to be showcasing,"
3987120,3989840," YouTube shopping, was beta."
3989840,3994280," So it had to be activated on a specific scheduled event."
3994280,3995920," We don't normally do scheduled events."
3995920,4003000," We go live kind of like you go live on Twitch where you just start streaming in your, well,"
4003000,4008720," in our case, in your encoding software and in our restreamer."
4008720,4010080," So it just goes when it goes."
4010080,4011320," There is no schedule."
4011320,4016320," But we had to set up a schedule because they had to activate that feature."
4016320,4018480," We didn't go live to the scheduled one."
4018480,4021400," We went live to our normal one that we used for Wanshow."
4021400,4023840," So the title and thumbnail was wrong."
4023840,4028000," And then for the VOD, once we actually got it switched over to the scheduled one, the"
4028000,4031720," first two and a half minutes where I even explained what the crap was going on."
4031720,4032720," It's all gone."
4032720,4033720," We're missing."
4033720,4040800," And so all we see is me sitting there confused because I'm trying to, I'm trying to process,"
4040800,4043360," am I supposed to be, sorry, am I supposed to back up?"
4043360,4045240," And we start again."
4045240,4047280," What do you mean we streamed to the wrong key?"
4047280,4048280," What does that even mean?"
4048280,4051480," Because I haven't used the scheduled thing since YouTube fixed their live streaming."
4051480,4053080," So I don't have to use it anymore."
4053080,4055880," So I haven't touched it in like two or three years."
4055880,4057040," What does that even mean?"
4057040,4058040," Do I start at the beginning?"
4058040,4059280," They're like, no, no, don't start at the beginning."
4059280,4060280," I'm sitting here going, right?"
4060280,4061360," But what about the VOD?"
4061360,4066280," But I can't ask these questions because I am live on stream right now having just sent"
4066280,4069360," a go live notification of thousands of people."
4069360,4072000," And the problem with that is you don't get another one."
4072000,4076360," So like, you didn't send out a second one because it's technically a different stream"
4076360,4077360," destination."
4077360,4081080," So we did get two notifications, which is even worse."
4081080,4083760," Okay, but now he doesn't get another one of the right one."
4083760,4086000," I think you have daily limit is four or five."
4086000,4087560," Yeah, but you can't burst them, right?"
4087560,4088560," I don't think so."
4088560,4089560," Can you?"
4089560,4090560," I'm not sure."
4090560,4094000," What I do know is that the reason that you have a notification limit per day, the reason"
4094000,4098160," they're gated is because of viewer fatigue."
4098160,4099160," Yeah."
4099160,4100920," They're trying to protect you from yourself."
4100920,4103960," People don't want their phone blinds left and I'm busy right now."
4103960,4104960," What is this?"
4104960,4107720," We don't need something like that for a flow plane, but you definitely need something like"
4107720,4110520," that for if you're like a YouTube or a Twitch."
4110520,4111520," Absolutely."
4111520,4112520," Definitely."
4112520,4117640," So pretty much I was looking at it going."
4117640,4119840," All right."
4119840,4122320," What is the net benefit of leaving this up?"
4122320,4126360," The whole point of this, the sponsored aspect of this stream, because we're going to talk"
4126360,4128680," about Google I/O on Wancho anyway."
4128680,4133760," So the whole point of this sponsored stream is for them to showcase this feature that"
4133760,4136400," is only applicable to live."
4136400,4141880," Pull the video, go find something else, upload that today."
4141880,4143240," And so that's what we did."
4143240,4144240," Sorry, guys."
4144240,4148240," I didn't mean to kind of leave people in the dark, but also people seemed to mostly"
4148240,4149240," not care."
4149240,4151480," It didn't even manage to generate an outrage thread over on Reddit."
4151480,4152480," So impressive."
4152480,4155280," Yeah, it's actually quite impressive."
4155280,4157280," All right."
4157280,4160200," Oh, OK, we got people asking, did YouTube still pay you?"
4160200,4162600," Yes, apparently the deal is not dead."
4162600,4163960," We do have some more stuff coming."
4163960,4167880," We've got some shorts on the three new hardware devices."
4167880,4171560," And then we've also got a second stream coming."
4171560,4177040," But the second stream is going to have a far more structured format."
4177040,4182720," And there'll be a clear thing for us to talk about is the goal, I think."
4182720,4183720," That's good."
4183720,4184720," Yeah."
4184720,4185720," Fricking A."
4185720,4186720," Go ahead."
4186720,4187960," I was just going to topic transition us."
4187960,4189400," So if you have more to say, go for it."
4189400,4193720," Oh, speaking of the devices, I wanted to kind of talk about those a little bit."
4193720,4197400," Pixel 7A looks killer."
4197400,4201240," Would you ever go pixel again after the experiences you've had?"
4201240,4202480," Actually, yes, probably."
4202480,4203480," Really?"
4203480,4204480," Because there's one killer feature."
4204480,4208520," You are basically like in an abusive relationship at this point, though."
4208520,4209520," Yes."
4209520,4210520," OK."
4210520,4212520," But if someone else releases this feature, I will very likely be gone."
4212520,4213520," All right."
4213520,4215520," What is your screen call?"
4215520,4218520," It's actually amazing."
4218520,4221280," And I use it all the time."
4221280,4226560," I have not picked up a call from a scammer in like years."
4226560,4228400," All right."
4228400,4229400," All right."
4229400,4231320," That's hilarious."
4231320,4234080," They always come crawling back."
4234080,4235080," Yeah."
4235080,4236080," OK."
4236080,4240840," I even had Riley called me, but I didn't have his like color ID in my phone."
4240840,4245000," And it showed up as it showed up in a way that looked super scammy because there was"
4245000,4246000," like--"
4246000,4247000," Yeah."
4247000,4249960," It just said like British Columbia, but there's a bunch of spaces in the middle of it."
4249960,4251440," So I was like, oh, this is definitely a scam."
4251440,4253160," So I screened it."
4253160,4256840," But then it says on the thing, like very clearly, he's like, yeah, there's something"
4256840,4257840," going on with Flow Play."
4257840,4258840," And I need to--"
4258840,4259840," And I'm like, OK."
4259840,4260840," Sweet."
4260840,4261840," By the way, I just want to make it very clear."
4261840,4264680," Some people seem to think that the issue with the stream was Google's fault."
4264680,4266160," It was not."
4266160,4267680," OK."
4267680,4270840," Follow up question."
4270840,4276280," You've been looking kind of envious over my shoulder at the big screen full device."
4276280,4277280," No."
4277280,4278280," For a while."
4278280,4279280," Really?"
4279280,4280280," No."
4280280,4281280," Oh."
4281280,4282280," OK."
4282280,4283280," I thought you were pretty into like the spreadsheets and stuff."
4283280,4284280," Yeah."
4284280,4285280," I'm not spending $2,000 on a phone."
4285280,4286280," Oh, I thought--"
4286280,4287280," OK."
4287280,4288280," Well, you jumped ahead."
4288280,4289280," OK."
4289280,4290280," So yes, it looks cool."
4290280,4291280," And then--"
4291280,4292280," It looks interesting."
4292280,4293280," Follow up question."
4293280,4294880," I would really like to be able to like test drive one."
4294880,4296920," Man, I had a whole thing."
4296920,4297920," I was going to--"
4297920,4298920," Sorry."
4298920,4299920," You jumped right to the end."
4299920,4301920," Is Dennis's French fry thing?"
4301920,4302920," OK."
4302920,4305720," Sorry, go for it."
4305720,4306720," OK."
4306720,4309560," So you've been looking over my shoulder at the big screen on the fold."
4309560,4310560," Yeah."
4310560,4311560," OK."
4311560,4314920," Ah, see, now you've ruined it."
4314920,4315920," My bad."
4315920,4318560," Sorry, I was pretty confident anywhere you're good."
4318560,4319560," Oh, man."
4319560,4322880," Now I don't even remember what I was going to say."
4322880,4323880," Right, right."
4323880,4325280," I was going to say you're fairly wealthy."
4325280,4328000," Would you spend the $1,700 on the fold?"
4328000,4330720," I still have a house to save up for."
4330720,4331720," Yeah, that's true."
4331720,4332720," All right."
4332720,4335840," So dropping $2,000 on a phone doesn't feel fun."
4335840,4341480," I am probably planning like this September's release of phones"
4341480,4343560," to look into something because it's been--"
4343560,4346320," So you want an iPhone?"
4346320,4348920," Don't they release other ones at that time too?"
4348920,4350080," Might as well out of the loop."
4350080,4351080," It's been a long time."
4351080,4354000," I think the new Qualcomm chipset cycle"
4354000,4356600," is a little bit off of Apple cycle right now."
4356600,4357600," OK."
4357600,4358600," I don't know."
4358600,4362200," It's more like Spring because we just got the brand new S23."
4362200,4366760," I think Pixel 8 is kind of where I'd be aiming."
4366760,4367760," Yeah, OK."
4367760,4368480," One more cycle."
4368480,4370720," Because I'm 4A5G at this point."
4370720,4373040," So I'm a little far back."
4373040,4374840," Yeah, but you're still getting support."
4374840,4375360," Yeah."
4375360,4377160," So it's still fine for now, but it's"
4377160,4379320," time to start considering."
4379320,4380960," Yeah, that's fair."
4380960,4382720," Yeah, that's fair."
4382720,4385200," I hope the tablet goes well."
4385200,4386520," I mean, it's got a good processor."
4386520,4387520," It's $500."
4387520,4388960," It comes with the little dock."
4388960,4390960," And then the last one is, of course, the Pixel Fold."
4390960,4394680," I will have a lot to say once I actually get hands on with it."
4394680,4396240," Very excited."
4396240,4401880," But I need to really use it and try out some of the apps that I've had trouble with on"
4401880,4406040," my Samsung folding devices and see if they're any better."
4406040,4407440," So there's a comment on FoldPlinch."
4407440,4410840," It says, Luke doesn't seem like the kind of person who's getting an iPhone."
4410840,4413240," You might actually be kind of surprised."
4413240,4415560," You'd be surprised about both of us."
4415560,4417480," I daily drove the iPhone for years."
4417480,4418480," Yep."
4418480,4420200," And I have nothing really against iPhones."
4420200,4425200," My biggest issue with an iPhone is because I don't generally use them."
4425200,4430200," The needing to learn the platform doesn't sound interesting to me."
4430200,4432240," But I'm not against an iPhone necessarily."
4432240,4434720," There's honestly not a lot to learn."
4434720,4438520," Like it's, I don't know."
4438520,4441560," Yeah, I don't really know what to tell you."
4441560,4442560," Like there's stuff--"
4442560,4444320," There's also like weird things."
4444320,4446880," Like my phone's down there because it'll buzz the mics."
4446880,4452520," But I'm a big fan of like very, very clear home pages."
4452520,4453520," Yeah."
4453520,4458960," I only have things on my home page like like float plane calling email."
4458960,4464000," Like very like if I'm opening my phone it is probably for one of these types of applications."
4464000,4466320," I don't like the whole screen being full."
4466320,4471840," I'd love to, I'd love someone to just like corner Tim Cook and ask how is it actually"
4471840,4476640," possible on this green and blue marble that you guys do not allow me to put my icons wherever"
4476640,4477640," I want on my home screen."
4477640,4479320," Yeah, that one's actually crazy."
4479320,4483120," It's just one of those things that's just so obvious that you just obviously need to"
4483120,4487320," obviously fix this and it'll take like 20 minutes because you've obviously already done"
4487320,4488320," the dev work."
4488320,4490360," You just haven't rolled it for whatever reason."
4490360,4494960," It's like actually embarrassing how much that would influence my decision to get an iPhone."
4494960,4501560," It's not even possible that some iOS engineer didn't just stay late one day and fix that"
4501560,4506840," for laws on a creative day that is actually not possible."
4506840,4507840," It has happened."
4507840,4508840," I guarantee it."
4508840,4509840," Just the way developers work."
4509840,4511600," You know how developers work."
4511600,4512600," In fact."
4512600,4513600," I want to be like this."
4513600,4514520," This annoys me and then I just."
4514520,4524920," And they would just fix it because it's really stupid and really just needs to be fixed."
4524920,4527120," But it's very okay."
4527120,4531400," This is something that like really annoys me like you'll find little annoyances on both."
4531400,4534200," This is something that's been driving me absolutely crazy on Android and I don't know"
4534200,4536960," if it's just Android or if it's the Google app."
4536960,4540280," You know how Google kept telling us, okay, hang ups is going away."
4540280,4541280," G chat is going away."
4541280,4542280," Blah, blah, blah."
4542280,4544720," And it just like never goes away and it's still there."
4544720,4549440," So now whenever I share, I just took a screenshot and I clicked share."
4549440,4552240," If I go to."
4552240,4553400," I hate this menu."
4553400,4555240," This absolutely hate this menu."
4555240,4558640," Instead of instead of being just Gmail because I clicked."
4558640,4561000," I clicked Gmail."
4561000,4562000," There's now a second click."
4562000,4563880," Do you want to do chat or do you want to do email?"
4563880,4565720," No, I don't want to do chat."
4565720,4572040," I actually hate that menu so much that I will always go out of my way to not use it."
4572040,4573040," The share menu?"
4573040,4576360," Yeah, I'll just download things or copy links and then manually go to the messaging app"
4576360,4577360," and do it that way."
4577360,4581080," It's just like full of random things instead of the most recent people I talk to."
4581080,4582080," Yes."
4582080,4585920," And I'm like, how does it think I'm going to share this to someone that I haven't talked"
4585920,4591600," to in like five years when the like three people in my life that I share things to"
4591600,4593680," off my phone are never here."
4593680,4594680," Yeah."
4594680,4595760," Like what the heck?"
4595760,4597560," So it literally doesn't save me time."
4597560,4601200," And then the amount of times that it's like I have to scroll so much to find the right"
4601200,4604280," app or like the right person or whatever that is just I don't know."
4604280,4605280," I find it very annoying."
4605280,4606280," Okay, this is great."
4606280,4611560," So my top one is myself, my personal Gmail account, which I have probably never shared"
4611560,4614760," anything to because why would I?"
4614760,4618080," And my second one is my work account."
4618080,4620080," Yeah."
4620080,4622360," Which I would never share anything to from my phone."
4622360,4623440," Oh, actually that's not true."
4623440,4627680," I would email things to myself from time to time just because embarrassingly it's easier"
4627680,4634520," than just, you know, then I've got my son, my wife, my aunt, maybe."
4634520,4635520," Okay."
4635520,4636680," Oh, here we go."
4636680,4640120," Then I've got some random discord server that I have literally never shared anything"
4640120,4642000," to you on discord."
4642000,4643760," I actually do share things to you."
4643760,4647640," Another random discord server that I have literally never shared anything to."
4647640,4652080," And then two completely random teams message channels."
4652080,4653080," One is Dan."
4653080,4656120," Dan, when's the last time I shared anything to you over teams?"
4656120,4658640," Oh, I mean, you messaged me earlier."
4658640,4664400," So maybe that's why I'm there first literally never literally never literally never literally"
4664400,4665400," never."
4665400,4669600," I don't use this application literally never sometimes never."
4669600,4670600," Wow."
4670600,4671600," Fantastic."
4671600,4672600," What's the point?"
4672600,4678800," Wait, like I just my problem is that every single icon in my share menu, all of them are"
4678800,4679800," blue."
4679800,4681440," They're all blue and white."
4681440,4685760," I can't tell what any app is teams is blue and white Facebook is blue and white Twitter"
4685760,4686760," is blue and white."
4686760,4689320," They're all blue and white share with I can't."
4689320,4690800," Shoot, shoot, shoot."
4690800,4693760," Not that mom."
4693760,4696440," I'm sorry that float plane is contributed to your problem."
4696440,4698960," Why is everything blue?"
4698960,4703040," It's a very neutral like things are fine color."
4703040,4708280," Yeah, anyways, should I topic pivot us?"
4708280,4709280," Sure."
4709280,4710760," Should we move on YouTube?"
4710760,4712760," Another YouTube thing."
4712760,4718760," YouTube has confirmed that it is experimenting with blocking some users with ad blockers enabled"
4718760,4724360," from watching videos on the platform spicy."
4724360,4729560," YouTube has previously addressed this issue, but it has been a few years since the last"
4729560,4730560," time."
4730560,4734960," There's a screenshot of a YouTube notice to users with an ad block enabled that was posted"
4734960,4735960," to Reddit."
4735960,4737440," That's just the YouTube logo."
4737440,4739240," It says ad blockers are not allowed on YouTube."
4739240,4741320," It looks like you may be using an ad blocker."
4741320,4744240," Ads allow YouTube to stay free for billions of users worldwide."
4744240,4750120," You can go ad free with YouTube premium and creators can still get paid from your subscription."
4750120,4754600," And then there's a button that says allow YouTube ads and then there's another button"
4754600,4756000," that says try YouTube premium."
4756000,4759960," I don't know what allow YouTube ads would do."
4759960,4765720," Oh, maybe it maybe what if they like scripted away for your to disable the extension on"
4765720,4766720," that."
4766720,4769240," That must only work through Chrome or something."
4769240,4770240," I don't know."
4770240,4771960," I mean, most people are using Chrome."
4771960,4773480," So maybe it works."
4773480,4775320," Yeah, I don't know."
4775320,4781040," The more legitimate criticisms include that YouTube's ads have increased a great deal over"
4781040,4785560," time and that YouTube premium is relatively expensive from the perspective of occasional"
4785560,4786560," viewers."
4786560,4791920," Discussion question, is there any better way to convince people to pay for content?"
4791920,4793760," Um, no."
4793760,4798520," That's my response."
4798520,4803640," I don't think like I'm not saying this is necessarily a good way, but I don't think"
4803640,4806000," there's a different way."
4806000,4810120," Like, how do I, how do I, how do I even talk about this without starting some kind of"
4810120,4811120," firestorm?"
4811120,4812120," No, yeah, you're just going to get wrecked."
4812120,4813120," Because I think the entire."
4813120,4814680," I wish I was wearing my adblock."
4814680,4815680," Yeah."
4815680,4816680," Privateering shirt."
4816680,4823960," Because the entire counter argument to me last time around was that if consuming the"
4823960,4829640," ads was the form of payment for consuming content on the platform, then Google would"
4829640,4831760," block ad blockers."
4831760,4836760," So okay, here we are."
4836760,4842800," I don't know what else to tell you guys."
4842800,4847640," And I believe the main defense at that time was, well, it's like not actually like in the"
4847640,4848640," terms or something."
4848640,4849640," I guess it is now."
4849640,4852000," I guess so."
4852000,4853400," Is that better?"
4853400,4855320," I mean, yeah, I see about this."
4855320,4858520," Yeah, it's one of those things where."
4858520,4862920," And people are saying like flow play, I'm like, yeah, I think if people weren't subscribed"
4862920,4866440," on flow plane and they had adblock on YouTube and then this happens, I don't necessarily"
4866440,4868840," know that they're going to subscribe on flow plane."
4868840,4870680," Like these options have existed."
4870680,4871680," Yeah."
4871680,4872680," Already."
4872680,4876360," So if they weren't already subscribed to it, then that option is not the better way to convince"
4876360,4878040," people because it already existed."
4878040,4883720," And I actually didn't say you may not use ad blockers."
4883720,4885440," I mean, we've even talked about it in the past."
4885440,4887520," We showed people how to set up a frickin pie hole."
4887520,4891640," Yeah, we've shown multiple times how to set up these types of services."
4891640,4895920," All I said was you've got to consider the consequences of your actions."
4895920,4896920," Yeah."
4896920,4898920," The consequences are real."
4898920,4906000," The more people block ads, the more a platform will become actually not sustainable and they"
4906000,4910680," will introduce more draconian anti ad blocking measures."
4910680,4912400," That's just how it works."
4912400,4914080," That's I don't make these rules."
4914080,4918400," I'm just I'm the messenger."
4918400,4919880," Shoot plays."
4919880,4921520," No, raise your weapons."
4921520,4922520," Not you."
4922520,4923520," Not you."
4923520,4925000," The messenger."
4925000,4927800," I don't think they'll ever do anything about sponsor block though."
4927800,4928800," I don't know."
4928800,4931560," That's not their thing though."
4931560,4933200," Yeah, I guess so."
4933200,4937360," There's no actual financial incentive for them trying to block sponsor block."
4937360,4942080," Yeah, that's true."
4942080,4943080," It's hard to say."
4943080,4946840," I mean, I wouldn't even put it past them to just say, look, we don't allow any extensions"
4946840,4949640," that interfere with the functionality of YouTube."
4949640,4953000," Will that make YouTube a worse experience for some users?"
4953000,4954000," I mean, I don't think there's any."
4954000,4955360," I don't think it technically does though."
4955360,4958120," It just skips you forward in the video, right?"
4958120,4959520," I genuinely haven't used it."
4959520,4960520," I don't know what it does."
4960520,4963360," Yeah, it skips around in the video."
4963360,4965440," But I just using timestamp functionality."
4965440,4966840," It just wouldn't surprise me."
4966840,4968400," Yeah, for sure."
4968400,4969400," Yeah."
4969400,4972200," But yeah, that's."
4972200,4975240," That is what it is."
4975240,4976800," I'm not surprised."
4976800,4981400," Every once in a while, I'll get like, I'll be in my Google News thing and I'll jump to"
4981400,4986400," a web page and it's like, no, you can't watch this because I have it export to my browser"
4986400,4992120," and it bubble, bubble, you can't view this page unless you subscribe."
4992120,4996680," It's not an ad blocking thing, but it's just like some news page that requires a subscription."
4996680,4997680," Paygate."
4997680,4998680," Our people."
4998680,5000680," Okay, well, I'm not going to do that."
5000680,5002040," So I'm going to leave."
5002040,5004960," And the argument is like, oh, well, you lost their traffic, whatever."
5004960,5009880," And it's like, yeah, but I'm also not taxing their service."
5009880,5015080," And if I didn't pay and they didn't have ads and I did view it, how am I benefiting"
5015080,5017080," them?"
5017080,5018080," So like, I don't know."
5018080,5020040," I don't know that that's necessarily the wrong call for them."
5020040,5021640," That might be the right call for them."
5021640,5024880," Maybe this newspaper makes a bunch of money through subscriptions and they just, it's"
5024880,5026400," better for them to operate that way."
5026400,5027400," It's not my decision."
5027400,5028400," Yeah."
5028400,5030080," It's my decision to just not pay it."
5030080,5034640," Well, this is another like big controversy that I started when I said, look, the provider"
5034640,5038880," of the service or the product is the one who sets the price."
5038880,5040800," And if you don't like it, you don't pay it."
5040800,5045920," But just taking it is actually not how that works."
5045920,5046920," Yeah."
5046920,5049840," So like, I don't find some way to like break around that limitation."
5049840,5051200," I just don't read the article."
5051200,5052360," Just go find something else."
5052360,5055760," There is an incredible amount of stuff on the internet."
5055760,5060400," You really don't actually need to access that one thing."
5060400,5062960," True or worse, never spoken."
5062960,5064320," It's like actually okay."
5064320,5068400," There really is an incredible amount of stuff on the internet."
5068400,5073000," Your life will go on if you can't access that one video or article or whatever it is."
5073000,5074440," You'll be fine."
5074440,5075440," So I don't know."
5075440,5076600," I don't have a lot to say about this."
5076600,5078680," I am a YouTube premium subscriber."
5078680,5081440," So like, this won't affect me."
5081440,5083000," I watch a bunch of YouTube."
5083000,5085160," So it's like, and I use YouTube music."
5085160,5085680," Yeah."
5085680,5089000," I don't believe YouTube music is the best, but it comes with YouTube premium."
5089000,5090000," Yeah."
5090000,5091000," And I'm not going to pay for anything else."
5091000,5092000," Great value."
5092000,5093800," So it is what it is."
5093800,5097280," And when like, I look at the bundle and I do consider that I do actually use YouTube"
5097280,5099360," music all the time."
5099360,5102600," Like I run it for basically at least eight hours a day."
5102600,5103600," Yeah."
5103600,5105560," Because I use it for just background noise when I'm working."
5105560,5106560," Yeah."
5106560,5110960," I get the value out of my YouTube premium subscription for sure."
5110960,5111960," Yeah."
5111960,5115600," I don't know what to tell you guys."
5115600,5119040," I don't know what to tell you guys other than this is what happens."
5119040,5121720," And this is, okay, this is fair."
5121720,5125760," Someone in Flowplane Chat said, if you give someone something or a service that will become"
5125760,5130400," an expectation when it changes, people feel wronged."
5130400,5131400," And yeah, that's legit."
5131400,5132400," Yeah."
5132400,5137400," So I could understand people that have used ad blockers on YouTube for like a decade that"
5137400,5140240," are, it's now being blocked being like, well, that's annoying."
5140240,5141240," Yeah."
5141240,5142240," Yeah."
5142240,5143240," Sure."
5143240,5144240," Yeah."
5144240,5148600," And I think the answer to that may end up rightly being you mad bro."
5148600,5149600," Yeah."
5149600,5154040," Like realistically, I mean, you can say you're going to go somewhere else, but when you're"
5154040,5157160," trying to figure out how to fix your dishwasher, you won't."
5157160,5161200," You'll go to YouTube."
5161200,5164560," Some people will kind of will sputter and angrily say, no, I will."
5164560,5165960," Yes, you will."
5165960,5168200," Yes, you will."
5168200,5173200," Because that's the fastest because your time is worth money, which is exactly how the ads"
5173200,5174760," work."
5174760,5178000," Your time is worth money and that will be the fastest way to get that dishwasher repaired."
5178000,5179680," You'd be silly not to, right?"
5179680,5180680," It's tough."
5180680,5182200," You just watch the ads."
5182200,5188480," You can literally, you can load it up, have the ads play, put it down, gather your tools."
5188480,5191000," And then when the ads are done playing pick it back up again."
5191000,5196320," People are talking a lot about how much the prevalence of ads has increased on the platform"
5196320,5197320," lately."
5197320,5200120," And honestly, that is a big challenge."
5200120,5204080," And I do find it pretty obnoxious whenever I'm accidentally on an account that doesn't"
5204080,5205960," have YouTube premium."
5205960,5211720," To me, it's always, it's felt like the gas price problem where like it feels like, oh,"
5211720,5214480," like tons of people are blocking ads or whatever other reason."
5214480,5218360," So we need to increase ads and then, oh, we blocked ad blockers, but they're not going"
5218360,5219800," to pull the ads back probably."
5219800,5223280," Does it like, well, let me find."
5223280,5225680," We can serve you this many already."
5225680,5230120," And there's a lot of pressure on creators to increase the frequency of ads."
5230120,5231880," I mean, not here."
5231880,5241360," I got this report from Colton earlier that apparently is from Patty Galloway's latest newsletter,"
5241360,5242360," something something."
5242360,5246280," I hope this isn't like a paid newsletter or something that I am not supposed to talk"
5246280,5247280," about."
5247280,5248280," I just want to address this quickly."
5248280,5251000," Crusty, trombone and full plane chat said, nah, it's principal."
5251000,5252200," Ads are toxic."
5252200,5257560," I don't disagree, which is why I have premium and run a flow plane and do stuff like that."
5257560,5258760," I don't like ads."
5258760,5264560," I avoid them as much as I can, but like I don't do that with an ad blocker."
5264560,5267400," Yeah, that's, that's not actually your call to make."
5267400,5277360," If the, if the service says the, the payment is ads, then your options are, consume the"
5277360,5279600," service and pay with ads."
5279600,5283840," Don't consume the service or privateer and just know what you're doing."
5283840,5284840," That's what you're doing."
5284840,5289720," So I have my like the level that I'm happy with and you can have your own in that's"
5289720,5290720," why."
5290720,5292720," It's great."
5292720,5296280," I love anger, mon or anger, mon over on Twitch chat."
5296280,5299280," I don't understand who the F is buying crap out of ads."
5299280,5301080," Me neither."
5301080,5302080," And yet here we are."
5302080,5306960," They're clearly, they're clearly working pretty good."
5306960,5309200," Um, yeah."
5309200,5311400," So okay, this is, this is really interesting."
5311400,5314240," It's an evaluation of RPM."
5314240,5316880," So revenue per mill, which does not mean million."
5316880,5320840," It means thousand by average view duration."
5320840,5328560," And the, um, the argument made to me by our business team is, you know, hey, um, with"
5328560,5333600," how long when show runs the AdSense numbers for it would be insane."
5333600,5340160," Like potentially three times what we're making, um, which is thousands of US dollars per"
5340160,5345680," episode, additionally for when show, um, got to check and get approval from Linus."
5345680,5347400," Can you loop me in?"
5347400,5355880," Um, and basically, yeah, our, our RPMs are substantially lower than what they should"
5355880,5361400," be based on this like average RPM per video length, you know, chart here."
5361400,5365960," And basically my, my response is the part we're missing here in our calculations is the"
5365960,5367920," RPM of our baked in stuff."
5367920,5372440," Maybe for something like when show we should cut our rates, cut the sponsors out and do"
5372440,5373440," mid roles."
5373440,5375120," I just don't want to overdo it, right?"
5375120,5379920," Because that's the problem that I see on the platform is that you've got, you've got"
5379920,5383960," people trying to triple dip, right?"
5383960,5388560," They've got the pre roll ad and then they've got the mid roll ad and then they've got the"
5388560,5393120," shout out for their Patreon and then they've got the shout out for their sponsor and then"
5393120,5395680," they've got the shout out for their merch."
5395680,5400200," And so I think we were overdoing it for a while and in each video, we had a merch shout"
5400200,5402000," out plus a float plane shout out."
5402000,5403480," We've dialed that back."
5403480,5406640," So we are at, um, no mid."
5406640,5413360," So our typical loadout on LTT anyway is that we have pre rolls enabled, no mid rolls."
5413360,5420080," We do have our own baked in sponsorship spots and we will call out either float plane or"
5420080,5423760," the LTT store in a way that is organically integrated into the content."
5423760,5430080," That's sort of our loadout right now and seems to be about as high as you can go without"
5430080,5431080," it being obnoxious."
5431080,5435440," And there's been a lot of arguments internally pushing me to turn mid roll ads on and every"
5435440,5441960," time I kind of come back and I say, okay, sure, what are we getting rid of?"
5441960,5448400," And the answer is always, I don't know, I think we have a pretty, I think we have a pretty"
5448400,5450840," optimal configuration right now."
5450840,5453880," I don't, I don't think we're going to change it anytime soon, especially when they're"
5453880,5454880," Dennis ads."
5454880,5455880," We'll see."
5455880,5456880," Yeah."
5456880,5457880," Yeah."
5457880,5460840," I think if anything, what we need to do is just make our baked in stuff more engaging"
5460840,5462320," and convert better."
5462320,5465040," And then we can increase our rates for that if we really want more money."
5465040,5466040," Like let's just work for it."
5466040,5468600," Do I guess is my response make the ads content."
5468600,5471600," I know there's a few other careers in the space doing that type of thing too where it's"
5471600,5474520," like, you actually want to watch the ads because they're just funny."
5474520,5475520," Yeah."
5475520,5476520," And it's like, okay, cool."
5476520,5479000," You want to win me over that way?"
5479000,5483080," Like fair enough in my opinion."
5483080,5485720," Last week was not Dennis spots on Wanshow."
5485720,5490120," That's why it wasn't as entertaining a flip plane chat at Dennis is on vacation."
5490120,5495160," So oh, yeah, we had the thorium proposal, but that wasn't, I guess that was a sponsor"
5495160,5496160," spot."
5496160,5497160," Right."
5497160,5498160," I forgot."
5498160,5499760," That's how that's how organically integrated it was."
5499760,5502360," I thought it was a sponsor spot speaking of sponsors."
5502360,5504600," Hey, perfect segue time."
5504600,5506560," Perfect segue."
5506560,5510200," Uh, Squarespace."

5553680,5554680," Tried to mix them up."
5554680,5555680," Ah, yeah, I did."
5555680,5556680," I mixed them up."
5556680,5561080," And then, ha ha ha ha jump cloud."
5561080,5563240," Thanks to jump cloud for sponsoring this episode."
5563240,5565320," Jump Cloud is an open directory platform."

5571760,5573440," in a cost effective manner."
5573440,5577360," It also helps you manage the proliferation of identities that's created by the cloud and"
5577360,5580280," software as a service applications, proliferation of identities."
5580280,5581800," I love that."
5581800,5589520," That is such a, that is such a jargony way to say, there's too many logins."

5610600,5612680," Jump Cloud has got your back."
5612680,5616520," So try jump cloud today using the link in the video description."
5616520,5619640," The show is also brought to you by, I guess we spoiled it, Csonic."
5619640,5624600," Csonic's prime TX-1000 watt power supply is a great choice for high performance systems."
5624600,5628440," Features an 80 plus titanium efficiency rating, which means less power gets wasted during power"
5628440,5629440," conversion."
5629440,5635280," It's also fully modular and features hybrid fan control to control overall fan noise and"
5635280,5636800," it's got fluid dynamic bearings."
5636800,5640040," So when that fan is spinning, it's going to be super quiet."
5640040,5643640," As it comes with a 12 year warranty, you can trust them bro."
5643640,5646920," Actually I did see quite a few positive comments about Csonic when we were discussing the whole"
5646920,5650920," warranty thing unrelated to their sponsor talking point, but did see it."
5650920,5653600," If you're building a new system and looking for a power supply that you can rely on, you"
5653600,5658240," can trust Csonic, check them out at csonic.com or through the links down below."
5658240,5660960," All right, Dan, you got a couple of merch messages."
5660960,5664160," I suspect you do because you made me use the camera."
5664160,5668520," I couldn't help noticing that a few people might have bought some stick locks."
5668520,5670000," Oh, just a couple."
5670000,5672640," A couple people bought them."
5672640,5675960," I will also say, I just noticed you are too."
5675960,5679160," So I've been messing with these like the whole show."
5679160,5683480," I think they're legitimately just as good as a fidget toy as they are."
5683480,5684480," Oh boy."
5684480,5686480," Do a purpose."
5686480,5689760," Everything we sell turns into a fidget toy."
5689760,5690760," The screwdriver this."
5690760,5695200," Yeah, I think that says more about us then maybe."
5695200,5697960," Okay, let's see."
5697960,5698960," Let's see."
5698960,5699960," The first one here."
5699960,5705360," Hey, LLD, longtime watcher since my formative tween years prior to getting more into tech."
5705360,5709040," I'm ashamed to admit that I attempted to download more RAM."
5709040,5711200," What has been your most dumb tech mistake?"
5711200,5715840," Oh, it was definitely the time that I plugged the floppy power connector into a header on"
5715840,5717560," an adding card."
5717560,5719480," Fried that bad boy."
5719480,5720480," Fried it good."
5720480,5722360," I've only ever."
5722360,5725400," I was very young."
5725400,5727040," Accidentally murdered."
5727040,5729640," One piece of hardware that I can remember."
5729640,5731360," It was really early on at the company."
5731360,5732680," I just roasted a motherboard."
5732680,5734400," Do you remember that?"
5734400,5736120," Just flash the wrong BIOS onto it."
5736120,5737760," It just never came back."
5737760,5738760," Nice."
5738760,5740200," It was like really early on."
5740200,5742400," That's really very nice."
5742400,5748520," I think it was my personal board, but that computer was a computer that I got from you."
5748520,5749520," Right."
5749520,5752160," And I needed it for work because I was doing forum stuff."
5752160,5755560," So it was like, uh, nice."
5755560,5757920," Yeah."
5757920,5761440," And then you gave me like, if I remember correctly, you gave me what was technically"
5761440,5768720," an upgraded board, but it was like, uh, you know, when you, you go high enough that like"
5768720,5772880," the support for it is bad and it's like actually worse experience because you're not going"
5772880,5777400," to use the features and like, yeah, it was one of those situations."
5777400,5778400," Nice."
5778400,5779400," Yeah."
5779400,5781200," So that was really unfortunate."
5781200,5784760," But yeah, I can still heal them popping on the table there."
5784760,5785760," Um, sorry."
5785760,5786760," All right."
5786760,5787760," Next up."
5787760,5793240," Wondering if you've ever considered exploring the technology behind powered generation plants."
5793240,5798080," I mean, sounds super cool."
5798080,5801040," Sounds like the kind of place that would be a little tough to get a tour of."
5801040,5802040," Yeah."
5802040,5803760," Absolutely on that second point."
5803760,5804760," Yeah."
5804760,5809000," I mean, is anyone going to show us, you know, the nitty gritty of a nuclear power plant?"
5809000,5812200," Would I be interested in anything that isn't a nuclear power plant?"
5812200,5818000," I mean, what am I going to go look at like a coal fire?"
5818000,5822600," Yesterday's technology today, the furnace is real big."
5822600,5823600," Wow."
5823600,5825600," That's hot."
5825600,5826800," Okay."
5826800,5829400," We're joking."
5829400,5831760," Like obviously there's more interesting than that."
5831760,5832760," Yeah."
5832760,5833760," It's more advanced."
5833760,5839000," A lot of technology, but, um, yeah, no, I can't say that that's my most, that's the"
5839000,5842200," most up my alley that something could be."
5842200,5843200," Yeah."
5843200,5844200," Okay."
5844200,5846120," And last one we're going to have a look at here."
5846120,5848960," I've worked in both banking and engineering."
5848960,5852960," And in both, we solely use virtual machines for their increased security and work from"
5852960,5854760," home as LMG grows."
5854760,5859600," Do you think we will switch to some, if not all employees to virtual machines?"
5859600,5860600," Yeah."
5860600,5861960," Um, definitely not all."
5861960,5862960," No."
5862960,5868840," I think for high performance applications like video editing, it's just, it's a, it's"
5868840,5877800," not a clear enough benefit for security to outweigh the improved performance and be my"
5877800,5883000," understanding is it's not a supported use case for any of the major video editing software"
5883000,5889120," users and working within a VM theoretically is completely transparent to the software,"
5889120,5894840," but in practice is not always completely bug free."
5894840,5900320," And Adobe Creative Suite does not need help."
5900320,5901320," It's got enough bugs."
5901320,5904320," Yeah, it doesn't need more problems."
5904320,5909600," So I think we're going to use it in, in, in, in a best case scenario on a bare metal"
5909600,5912240," workstation basically forever."
5912240,5922920," I could see some kind of thin client or some kind of, um, VDI thing for just general work"
5922920,5923920," stations."
5923920,5928320," I think we're going to do a video in the next little bit, just kind of exploring VDI because"
5928320,5935400," we've never really dug into it, but I don't see us just rolling that out wholesale anytime"
5935400,5936400," soon."
5936400,5941320," But yeah, I can't, I can't think of any reason that like a sales person or someone in accounting"
5941320,5947280," couldn't just be working off a thin client or we're going to have to, right now we have"
5947280,5949760," one standard and it's not good."
5949760,5953400," Um, like it's not good to have one standard, I should say."
5953400,5958760," The standard that was made might have been very good for an important subset of people,"
5958760,5963720," which would be high performance users, like editors, but we have so many different types"
5963720,5969200," of people at the company now in regards to what they do, um, that just having one doesn't"
5969200,5970440," make a ton of sense."
5970440,5975240," So yeah, we might have a variety of different options on the line, but it will vary quite"
5975240,5976240," a bit."
5976240,5978960," Pat Zilin, full plane chat says having to use thin clients at work makes me want to bash"
5978960,5980200," my head against my desk."
5980200,5981880," It's God awful slow, right?"
5981880,5982880," But that depends."
5982880,5983880," Yeah, right."
5983880,5987400," That depends on what the hardware behind the thin client is."
5987400,5989900," The thin client doesn't affect the performance."
5989900,5992920," It's the actual VM that it's tapped into."
5992920,5994840," And there are high performance thin clients."
5994840,5999400," My understanding is they're very common in the like CAD and design industry."
5999400,6002720," And I think that's to do with that it's cheaper from a software licensing standpoint"
6002720,6003720," or something like that."
6003720,6009960," Cause the software is so expensive that you're basically an idiot to be buying one seat"
6009960,6014200," for every person who might use it and you're far better off buying many licenses and then"
6014200,6015520," sharing them or something."
6015520,6016520," Don't quote me on that."
6016520,6019880," It's just something that I heard at some point maybe."
6019880,6020880," Nice."
6020880,6025400," Um, but yeah, well, well, things will, things will change."
6025400,6026400," Okay."
6026400,6028440," So let's get a couple of potentials out here."
6028440,6033360," If you want, uh, hey, LOD for Linus wondering if basketball shorts are a thing that's on"
6033360,6034360," the menu."
6034360,6035720," Will we eventually do that?"
6035720,6036720," No."
6036720,6037720," No."
6037720,6040600," He's saying it's not on the menu, not that we'll never do it."
6040600,6041600," Yeah."
6041600,6042600," Yeah."
6042600,6043600," The first thing."
6043600,6044600," Yeah."
6044600,6045600," Okay."
6045600,6046600," I think it's pretty unlikely though."
6046600,6048240," Are there not enough brands that make basketball shorts?"
6048240,6051080," Like basketball shorts are one of those things where it's just what would we be adding to"
6051080,6052080," the conversation?"
6052080,6059480," Hey, DLL Steve or Austin going to LTX neither has been confirmed or denied."
6059480,6061560," Then I guess I can neither confirm nor deny."
6061560,6062560," Oh, exciting."
6062560,6067080," Well, no, I mean, it's just the thing is like it's not, it's not up to me to, to announce"
6067080,6068880," things like that for people."
6068880,6070360," Um, uh, okay, fine."
6070360,6071480," I'll tell you what, I'll say this."
6071480,6075000," They both been invited, but life happens, right?"
6075000,6077000," It's, people aren't always available."
6077000,6081400," Even if there's a very busy people, even if we were actually BFFs, right?"
6081400,6083120," That doesn't mean they can necessarily make it."
6083120,6084120," It's LTX."
6084120,6085120," It's not my wedding."
6085120,6086400," I'm not going to be mad, right?"
6086400,6087680," If they can make it, that's awesome."
6087680,6090760," I think it's going to be a great event and if they can't make it, well, then hey, that"
6090760,6091760," they'll see you next year."
6091760,6092760," That's awesome."
6092760,6093760," That'll be a great event too."
6093760,6094760," It's all good."
6094760,6096920," I bet some more LTX ones."
6096920,6099560," Hello, me, audio, only me tomorrow."
6099560,6104680," DLL, how do we buy products and have them waiting for pickup at LTX?"
6104680,6108280," Also rest in peace hotel prices over the last two years."
6108280,6111640," Oh, I don't know."
6111640,6112640," It's not a thing yet."
6112640,6114240," What a, oh, okay."
6114240,6115240," Is that the answer?"
6115240,6116240," I believe."
6116240,6120320," Um, I think, okay."
6120320,6124680," Somebody's going to scream at me."
6124680,6125680," I'm trying to remember."
6125680,6126680," Oh, yeah."
6126680,6127680," I'm going to pull a line."
6127680,6128680," No answer yet."
6128680,6129680," I'll say that much."
6129680,6130680," There we go."
6130680,6131680," All right."
6131680,6133440," Cause I know if you're, if you're here locally, you can buy stuff here locally, but there's"
6133440,6135200," going to be a, well, you can buy stuff."
6135200,6138440," Oh, oh, you mean if you come to the show, yes, you can buy stuff."
6138440,6139440," Yeah."
6139440,6140440," Yeah."
6140440,6142280," But I don't mean right now if you're in BC, you can buy stuff locally."
6142280,6148720," I mean, if you're, if you're at LTX, there's going to be like a store and you can buy stuff."
6148720,6153080," There is also the, the remote bridge thing that we're planning where float plane and"
6153080,6158960," LTX store are going to have a login authentication thingy to see if you are currently subscribed"
6158960,6162840," at whatever, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, so that you can buy stuff."
6162840,6165040," And that's not done yet."
6165040,6168020," So we don't know exactly when it will be ready."
6168020,6169020," Got it."
6169020,6170020," More LTX."
6170020,6174000," Oh, I do have a bit of an update on LTT store, not calm though."
6174000,6175000," Okay."
6175000,6177520," I think we've settled on a location for it."
6177520,6178520," Sorry."
6178520,6179520," That's me."
6179520,6180520," I think it's going to."
6180520,6181520," Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh."
6181520,6183320," Uh oh, did I say something wrong?"
6183320,6187400," You must have said something wrong because the one and only Nick light has made a call"
6187400,6188640," to me."
6188640,6189640," What I do wrong."
6189640,6190640," I have two things."
6190640,6191880," One, one from this one from earlier."
6191880,6192880," So got two things."
6192880,6193880," One right here."
6193880,6194880," One right here."
6194880,6195880," Yeah."
6195880,6200760," Um, if you have an LTX ticket, you should be able to pre purchase your merch already"
6200760,6201920," on the LTT site."
6201920,6203520," Oh, cool."
6203520,6207240," You just have to use the same email to log in on the site as you bought the ticket with"
6207240,6208240," need."
6208240,6209240," Yeah."
6209240,6213680," And then the other thing was when you're talking about retailers earlier, um, we are figuring"
6213680,6214840," out our retail strategy."
6214840,6219920," I can't really say more than that right now, um, on live, but that's why we don't have like"
6219920,6221160," updates on micro center and stuff."
6221160,6222160," It's not on their side."
6222160,6223160," It's on our set."
6223160,6224160," Oh, really?"
6224160,6225160," Yeah."
6225160,6226160," Oh, okay."
6226160,6227160," So."
6227160,6231400," If you want, you can call me after the show."
6231400,6232400," Oh, okay."
6232400,6233400," All right."
6233400,6234400," Sure."
6234400,6235400," So print."
6235400,6236400," All right."
6236400,6237400," Later."
6237400,6239840," We saw him as Nick."
6239840,6241360," We said too many things wrong."
6241360,6245360," Let's see if we can do it again."
6245360,6248000," Twice in the same show would be pretty great."
6248000,6252840," We could see how many different people we can summon on one show."
6252840,6256840," Oh, Tynan's already been blown up my phone."
6256840,6260040," So that's two is the upstairs."
6260040,6261040," Stick locks."
6261040,6262400," Cause he worked on stick locks."
6262400,6265560," He has made a message him and I ghosted him."
6265560,6266560," Nice."
6266560,6267560," I'll just root."
6267560,6268560," He will watch it back later."
6268560,6269560," I don't know why he wants."
6269560,6270560," I think he just excited."
6270560,6271560," Who knows?"
6271560,6274360," Um, it's all a merch by the way, not just LTX merch."
6274360,6277800," The, the idea is that you can place your order and then just like pick it up when you're"
6277800,6281080," there, which will make more sense the closer to the event we get."
6281080,6282080," Yeah."
6282080,6283080," Yeah."
6283080,6284080," Yeah."
6284080,6285080," Right."
6285080,6287080," So I wanted to give the update on LTT store, not calm."
6287080,6292160," We have not decided to proceed with the retail space that we found that was pretty cool"
6292160,6297160," because I think what we're going to do is more of like a warehouse-y style thing where"
6297160,6302400," you can, you can pick up, but also it'll be like operating as a warehouse and it'll be"
6302400,6304600," in more of like an industrial area."
6304600,6308680," I think it's going to be where the little gym is now."
6308680,6310800," And so that'll become LTT store and not calm."
6310800,6314120," So this is, this is how you're going to tell me that I'm not getting my wish."
6314120,6317840," Oh, you're getting your wish."
6317840,6325080," So I have other big news, our financing got approved for a second, what about second"
6325080,6326520," badminton unit?"
6326520,6327920," Oh."
6327920,6332200," So the badminton center is going to be substantially larger."
6332200,6333200," Yeah."
6333200,6335560," It will be 14 courts now."
6335560,6344000," And there will be a pretty decent like 1600, 1800 square foot gym."
6344000,6345000," Of badminton courts?"
6345000,6346000," No."
6346000,6349600," Of like 1600, not 16,000."
6349600,6350600," Yeah."
6350600,6351600," Yeah."
6351600,6352600," What's going to be there?"
6352600,6353600," I don't know."
6353600,6354840," I was going to ask you like, what's good?"
6354840,6356920," Like it's an actual like gym, like a workout gym?"
6356920,6361280," Yeah, like for members."
6361280,6362280," That's pretty cool."
6362280,6363280," Yeah."
6363280,6364520," So I'm suddenly like way more excited."
6364520,6365520," Yeah, I know."
6365520,6366520," So wait, you're serious?"
6366520,6367520," Yeah."
6367520,6368520," Oh, that's sick."
6368520,6369520," That's sick."
6369520,6372800," I've been trying to convince him to have the current one turned into a gym for a long"
6372800,6373800," time."
6373800,6375560," And there's all these like liability problems, which are legit."
6375560,6380160," So I understand, but it would just be sweet if it was like a thing."
6380160,6381160," Wow."
6381160,6382160," That's cool."
6382160,6383960," Yeah, it's going to be awesome."
6383960,6390400," So obviously everyone who works at Yvonne Umbrella Corporation, any of the companies"
6390400,6394120," under there will be able to get access to the gym with the gym."
6394120,6395120," YPC?"
6395120,6397120," I don't know."
6397120,6398120," Okay."
6398120,6399120," So here's the thing."
6399120,6403560," I don't know if I'll be able to just be like, yeah, you get it for free because that could"
6403560,6409640," hurt the KPIs of the operations manager who we have actually hired now who's going to"
6409640,6410640," be running that."
6410640,6412880," That's a lot of people to give access to that for free."
6412880,6413880," Yeah."
6413880,6415200," So all have similar working schedules."
6415200,6416200," Yeah."
6416200,6418120," So I don't want to screw anyone over."
6418120,6421400," Just go like, hey, yeah, you know, your KPIs that you have to be profitable."
6421400,6426600," Oh, by the way, you have a hundred free users in your gym."
6426600,6428080," Good luck."
6428080,6431080," That's pretty funny."
6431080,6433880," I'm not salting them slack asks, so when's the pickleball tournament?"
6433880,6439280," Yeah, probably when I turn about 55, we'll convert it to pickleball."
6439280,6440480," That's what I kind of have in mind."
6440480,6444000," I'm just going to be like, hey, everyone who was playing, shut it down."
6444000,6445000," Shut it down."
6445000,6446560," Okay, we're moving the nets down."
6446560,6447560," Moving the nets down."
6447560,6448560," Okay, we're pickleball facility."
6448560,6449560," Change the sign."
6449560,6451760," Wooden paddles now or whatever it is."
6451760,6452760," I think it's wooden paddles."
6452760,6453760," I don't remember."
6453760,6455320," Yeah, I'm excited."
6455320,6456320," I'm excited."
6456320,6457880," It's going to be awesome."
6457880,6459240," Yeah, super excited."
6459240,6460240," Okay."
6460240,6461240," Same time."
6461240,6465080," When can we be expected to be notified if we are selected to volunteer at LTX?"
6465080,6468040," Oh, I don't think either of us are going to know."
6468040,6469040," I have no idea."
6469040,6470040," Yep."
6470040,6471040," I would hope pretty soon."
6471040,6472040," Yep."
6472040,6475280," Like if we haven't told people pretty soon, then it's going to be pretty tough for them"
6475280,6480080," to schedule."
6480080,6483880," You know what I would do is post on the forum because I know that Chase is monitoring the"
6483880,6485080," LTX thread there."
6485080,6487040," Yeah, post on the LTT forum."
6487040,6491160," This might be a question for Tynan, but has there been any testing to see if the stick"
6491160,6495280," locks fit on the Steam Deck inside the OEM case?"
6495280,6496440," That's a good question."
6496440,6499040," Tynan would probably know that."
6499040,6502240," It used to be that our inventory was right on the other side of this wall here and I"
6502240,6505240," could just run and grab a Steam Deck case."
6505240,6507280," But it's not."
6507280,6509040," So I don't know."
6509040,6513000," Yeah, we'd have to figure that out."
6513000,6514000," And let's see."
6514000,6518080," The bag you are developing for consoles like the Steam Deck have some kind of stick protection"
6518080,6519080," built in."
6519080,6523080," The Steam Deck's original case has some cutouts to give the stick space, for example."
6523080,6528560," Yeah, it doesn't, but it's also very, very early in development right now and that's"
6528560,6531480," not impossible, but it could be very challenging."
6531480,6536840," So depending on the route we go, if we go switch specific, then it could, but if we go universal,"
6536840,6538080," then it wouldn't be able to."
6538080,6540480," Then you should bundle it with some stick locks."
6540480,6541480," Sticks locks."
6541480,6542480," A.E."
6542480,6543480," There we go."
6543480,6547840," I think we should, yeah, we can move on here if you guys like."
6547840,6548840," Yeah, sure."
6548840,6552440," Two to three more topics, please."
6552440,6554200," Let's say what this watch thing."
6554200,6559080," Yeah, let's talk about this watch thing because I am ticked."
6559080,6560080," Oh boy."
6560080,6566520," Fossil, who acquired Misfit in 2015, has discontinued support from Misfit Watches, the"
6566520,6569640," companion app and website."
6569640,6576080," What this means, get this, is that users will no longer be able to adjust some settings,"
6576080,6578720," including changing the time."
6578720,6580720," Am I right?"
6580720,6583160," They still sell them?"
6583160,6586760," The most recent models of Misfit Watches were launched in 2018 and only stopped production"
6586760,6589240," in late 2019 and early 2020."
6589240,6593800," Fossil still sells smart watches based on Misfit's hybrid watch technology."
6593800,6597040," Fossil doesn't appear to have made any announcement."
6597040,6605000," It simply dropped Misfit from its brand page and users found themselves unable to log in."
6605000,6610560," Are you kidding me?"
6610560,6613400," Nya."
6613400,6615600," Fossil confirmed, oh, okay."
6615600,6617280," When we, oh, we apparently contacted them."
6617280,6618280," Oh, good job."
6618280,6619280," When show team."
6619280,6624880," Fossil confirmed it was indeed dropping support from Misfit when contacted by Linus Media Group."
6624880,6635520," You know, I never really got it before."
6635520,6641080," The whole expensive watch thing, you know, like, like, like, mechanical watches, you know,"
6641080,6642080," it'll still work."
6642080,6644080," At least it'll still work."
6644080,6645080," What the heck?"
6645080,6646080," And this is awesome."
6646080,6647080," This is like a premium brand."
6647080,6648080," So we can't remotely take it from you."
6648080,6649080," I think it is."
6649080,6650080," I don't actually know, but I'm pretty sure it is."
6650080,6658080," Fossil."
6658080,6664160," How is it even possible that there is no obligation if you drop support for a product"
6664160,6666920," you sold to open source it?"
6666920,6670320," How is that even possible in the year 2023?"
6670320,6672520," Oh, Star Wars collaboration with Fossil."
6672520,6673520," Hold on."
6673520,6674520," I can get Luke Claptop."
6674520,6675520," Let's go."
6675520,6677920," They have Luke Skywalker leather watch."
6677920,6678920," Okay, hold on."
6678920,6680320," Wait, wait, wait, stop looking at that."
6680320,6681320," Okay."
6681320,6682320," Okay."
6682320,6683320," Luke."
6683320,6684320," Yes."
6684320,6687080," What did that pop up say?"
6687080,6688320," You have my superpower too."
6688320,6690240," I saw you do it."
6690240,6696000," I actually, I remember it was like yellowy or gold or something and nothing."
6696000,6701200," I know nothing else about it."
6701200,6705320," That's all just the color that I might even, I might be right about that, but I might be"
6705320,6707800," conflating it with this golden watch that's on the screen."
6707800,6709680," Okay, so we're back to the laptop here."
6709680,6712640," Yeah, I just found that they did the Star Wars collaboration."
6712640,6717880," I thought it was funny because Linus is not into high end fashion particularly and also"
6717880,6719840," isn't into modern Star Wars."
6719840,6721440," So that would be funny."
6721440,6723640," Yeah, that would be the not Linus watch right there."
6723640,6726680," Especially this one because it's so gaudy."
6726680,6728640," Wow."
6728640,6730240," That would not suit you at all."
6730240,6731240," Thanks."
6731240,6732240," No problem."
6732240,6734280," I don't think any of these would suit me."
6734280,6735880," Are those dog tags cringe?"
6735880,6739240," Are those actual dog tags?"
6739240,6744600," Literally for $120 and it says C3PO on it."
6744600,6748480," Do people buy this?"
6748480,6749480," We need to just have more products."
6749480,6751120," There's zero reviews."
6751120,6755880," No, no, Luke, we need to just have more products because people are obviously just looking for"
6755880,6758240," something to throw money at at this point."
6758240,6759240," Yeah."
6759240,6760240," Really, okay."
6760240,6762360," Okay, the earrings are cute."
6762360,6765440," The earrings are pretty cute."
6765440,6767640," The charm bracelets, that's probably all right."
6767640,6770520," Oh, so fossils like not premium then."
6770520,6773480," Like these are, okay, to be clear."
6773480,6775160," $500, $600 for a while."
6775160,6780080," Obviously, that's like a lot of money but watches."
6780080,6782160," Yeah."
6782160,6786360," So they're not, as far as I can tell, they're not like insane but they're not cheap either."
6786360,6787360," Yeah."
6787360,6788360," Okay."
6788360,6789360," $250 purses."
6789360,6790360," That's not, I don't know."
6790360,6791680," I don't know anything to be honest."
6791680,6792680," Yeah."
6792680,6793680," About that stuff?"
6793680,6794680," No idea."
6794680,6795680," Got it."
6795680,6800200," Anyways, that's some BS."
6800200,6803240," You should not be able to just like turn off someone's ability to change the time on their"
6803240,6804240," watch."
6804240,6812000," Yeah, this whole thing, this whole thing is just, okay, fine here, let's talk about the"
6812000,6814480," badminton center some more."
6814480,6821120," Because I think that it's a waste of life to just mop a giant floor, I wanted to look"
6821120,6827280," into getting a robot, sweeper and vacuum and mop thing."
6827280,6831480," I assume that has to be a thing these days, you know, given that I don't think anyone"
6831480,6833840," has manually mopping airports."
6833840,6836840," Yeah, but you have like a consumer grade one."
6836840,6841480," So I want a commercial grade one that could do, you know, 30,000 square feet or whatever."
6841480,6842480," Right?"
6842480,6843480," Yeah, exactly."
6843480,6848840," So I rightly assumed that this is an actual product category that does exist."
6848840,6854720," Naturally, if I remembered the brand, I would name them because it's kind of hilarious"
6854720,6859080," and stupid and they deserve to be called hilarious and stupid."
6859080,6863840," But naturally you go on their site and there's no information whatsoever about pricing because"
6863840,6865200," why would there be?"
6865200,6866840," You have to contact someone."
6866840,6868040," This is great."
6868040,6871720," You contact someone so that you can get on a call with them."
6871720,6874960," That person cannot tell you anything."
6874960,6881840," Our entire job is to set up an appointment for you with someone from the sales team."
6881840,6885440," I was like, okay, well, this was a giant waste of time."
6885440,6887480," Thank you very much."
6887480,6888480," I'm sure."
6888480,6889480," Fine."
6889480,6893240," Schedule me another call because if you can't tell me how much it costs, then I guess we're"
6893240,6895600," not having a conversation right now."
6895600,6899040," So what's the point of talking about anything?"
6899040,6900800," Is that better than a robo-caller?"
6900800,6903360," Would you prefer a robo-caller in that situation?"
6903360,6906920," I mean, it might as well, but if you already have the online scheduling thing that I use"
6906920,6914440," to set up the first call, then it's just online scheduling with extra steps, right?"
6914440,6923600," So anyway, they set up the second call with me and we got as far as price and the price"
6923600,6929400," is about to outright buy because they offer a subscription service or an outright buy"
6929400,6930500," price."
6930500,6939220," And the price to buy is about a mid-range car, which honestly could make sense compared"
6939220,6943720," to paying a person for five years or whatever."
6943720,6945920," What you just said is exactly how it's priced."
6945920,6946920," Of course."
6946920,6948480," It's not priced based on the actual hardware."
6948480,6952500," It's a f***ing mop, right?"
6952500,6957140," It's priced based on the value that it provides, which is not a wrong way to price something,"
6957140,6961020," but it's a little frustrating that was so high, but that doesn't mean that I wasn't"
6961020,6962020," considering it."
6962020,6963660," I was considering it."
6963660,6967100," And then I asked, you know, what the process is like."
6967100,6970380," Okay, so how does it handle it, like vision?"
6970380,6972100," How does it navigate the facility?"
6972100,6976420," And they go, okay, well, we come out and we help you set it up."
6976420,6981700," We get the mapping configured and the routing configured and everything."
6981700,6986060," And then it just, like, it runs on your schedule and it goes and it does the thing."
6986060,6989340," And I'm like, okay, super cool."
6989340,6991540," What if I need to update the map for whatever reason?"
6991540,6993620," We reconfigure it."
6993620,6994620," You know, how is that done?"
6994620,6996940," And they're like, oh, we can help you with that remotely."
6996940,6999700," You log into our cloud thing and I go, okay, hold on a second."
6999700,7001420," Can I just clarify something?"
7001420,7003780," Does this run on site or does it run in the cloud?"
7003780,7005380," Like where's the processing actually handled?"
7005380,7008060," And they're like, that all runs on site."
7008060,7009140," And I'm like, oh, okay."
7009140,7011940," So the thing is actually like it has the processing built in."
7011940,7015260," They're like, yeah, yeah, it uses the X sensor and Y sensor and whatever else."
7015260,7018260," I'm like, okay, great."
7018260,7023220," But you said that the reconfiguring was done through the cloud and they're like, yes."
7023220,7024540," And I'm like, okay."
7024540,7030020," So in the event that you guys were to disappear for whatever reason, would I be able to reconfigure"
7030020,7031820," it without your cloud service?"
7031820,7033820," Well, we're not going to disappear."
7033820,7037780," And I go, right, but that isn't what I asked."
7037780,7043260," If you were to disappear, would there be any way for me to reconfigure this myself?"
7043260,7048020," Like is there is there a web portal built into this unit that I can access through an ethernet"
7048020,7050220," jack or something?"
7050220,7052940," And they basically were like, let me get back to you."
7052940,7057540," And I got an email back that was like, you know, based on your requirements, I don't think"
7057540,7059420," we'll be able to move forward."
7059420,7065300," And I'm like, based on my requirements, I think you guys are idiots because you are"
7065300,7072780," selling what will effectively become a $60, $70,000 paperweight in the event that, yeah,"
7072780,7074060," maybe you won't go out of business."
7074060,7077220," Yeah, they kept assuring me that their business was growing really well."
7077220,7080100," I'm like, that's not my concern."
7080100,7087780," I'm concerned about this tens of thousands of dollars investment that I, that is just"
7087780,7089300," junk."
7089300,7095700," If you just arbitrarily decide at some point that you don't feel like supporting it anymore,"
7095700,7097780," just unbelievable."
7097780,7100380," And it doesn't matter if they plan to be around."
7100380,7102660," What if they get acquired?"
7102660,7105860," And whoever the new owner is wants to extract more value."
7105860,7109060," What if they decide to just brick them?"
7109060,7110980," I just can't."
7110980,7112580," I just can't, man."
7112580,7113580," Yep."
7113580,7114580," Yep."
7114580,7115580," That's pretty brutal."
7115580,7116580," Yep."
7116580,7118820," Dis frustrated."
7118820,7124260," We're not going to disappear a company doomed to fail Andrew, knowing, yeah, in full plane"
7124260,7125260," chat."
7125260,7126260," Yeah, exactly."
7126260,7129420," Because this is the kind of thing that it's industrial equipment."
7129420,7132740," This is not something I expect to run for three or five."
7132740,7135940," So someone in full plane chat said 20 years down the road, you could still be using it."
7135940,7136940," That's a long time."
7136940,7137940," Yeah."
7137940,7139940," That's a freaking long time."
7139940,7141660," And you're not Boeing."
7141660,7142660," No offense."
7142660,7143660," Yeah."
7143660,7144660," Right."
7144660,7146140," You're not GE."
7146140,7147500," No offense."
7147500,7152980," When you are GE, I will still tell you to f*** off because that is still stupid."
7152980,7157100," I just, I can't, I can't, I can't handle it."
7157100,7160620," So like honestly, and that this is another crazy thing."
7160620,7165180," For $70,000, I mean, could we make our own?"
7165180,7166180," Maybe actually."
7166180,7167180," There's, yeah."
7167180,7169740," I mean, cause someone, someone linked in flow plane chat."
7169740,7170740," Yeah."
7170740,7175100," Apparently there's this scrubber that's made by a YouTuber and it's a scrubber that looks"
7175100,7179100," to be marketed towards people that have aircraft hangers."
7179100,7180100," Okay."
7180100,7184700," Best scrubbers because your hanger deserves it is the tech."
7184700,7185700," Okay."
7185700,7186700," Hold on."
7186700,7188660," Just a second here."
7188660,7190580," It looks like it's manually operated."
7190580,7192060," Oh, yeah."
7192060,7193060," No."
7193060,7197460," But like if you took one of these things, I'm sure you could convert it to not be manually"
7197460,7198460," or interesting."
7198460,7199460," Well, how much are these?"
7199460,7200460," I have no idea."
7200460,7201460," There's a contact us button."
7201460,7202460," Get good scrubbing."
7202460,7203460," Ah."
7203460,7204460," Ah."
7204460,7205460," Ah."
7205460,7206460," Yeah."
7206460,7208460," I think it's like give us a call type of situation."
7208460,7209460," Yeah."
7209460,7210460," Figures."
7210460,7214700," Quick release squeegee vacuum protection and easy feel."
7214700,7215700," Yeah."
7215700,7221140," It's like like maintenance would probably have to be manual and like I am assuming like draining"
7221140,7225060," the tank and whatnot would have to be manual where I bet you with the other solution it"
7225060,7229140," would be automated and automating that part of this thing would probably not be very feasible."
7229140,7230140," Yeah."
7230140,7231380," So I don't know."
7231380,7234140," You're probably not going to be able to get the whole way there."
7234140,7235780," But yeah."
7235780,7236780," Okay."
7236780,7238940," Army of Roombas."
7238940,7242100," I was thinking like my thing that does floor scrubbing."
7242100,7243100," Yeah."
7243100,7248180," I just had like I don't know 12 of them or something and you just zoned them all out."
7248180,7252540," So they just at a certain point of night they just all at the same time just."
7252540,7253540," Yeah."
7253540,7256140," It's kind of working."
7256140,7258380," Maybe I mean they they cycle their own water."
7258380,7261820," They do mopping like they do all this type of stuff."
7261820,7264460," Exterminate."
7264460,7267940," You could at the price difference between the 70 K for that."
7267940,7268940," Yeah."
7268940,7270240," And whatever you'd have to pay for these things."
7270240,7274240," You could just have like three of them in the back just in case one ties."
7274240,7277440," I don't know."
7277440,7279680," Someone linked an auto scrubber."
7279680,7280680," Yeah."
7280680,7282560," Pacific floor care."
7282560,7286120," S 28 disc 28 inch auto scrubber."
7286120,7287120," $15,000."
7287120,7288800," I mean that seems pretty reasonable."
7288800,7290640," It looks like someone's pushing it."
7290640,7291640," Yeah."
7291640,7293200," That's not the point."
7293200,7294200," Yeah."
7294200,7295960," I wanted an autonomous one."
7295960,7296960," Yeah."
7296960,7297960," Yeah."
7297960,7298960," It looks like a handle."
7298960,7300200," That's definitely a handle."
7300200,7302720," Almost certainly a handle."
7302720,7304840," So anyway, you know what?"
7304840,7309840," I guess we might just have to have mops or something."
7309840,7311040," But we'll figure it out."
7311040,7312080," Walmart has automated versions."
7312080,7313080," I don't know."
7313080,7317200," If we decide to do an automated one then it'll definitely be a video."
7317200,7322280," So remember how I said, hey forget about the automatic scorekeeping with the machine vision"
7322280,7323280," team."
7323280,7326280," We might need a machine vision team anyway."
7326280,7327920," For floor scrubber."
7327920,7328920," For one floor scrubber."
7328920,7332360," That sounds so much less worth it."
7332360,7335240," I'm like wow."
7335240,7337040," It sounds a lot easier."
7337040,7338240," Like way easier."
7338240,7340880," Can't you just put Roomba brains in it?"
7340880,7345280," Like just rip the like motors out of a Roomba and just glue it to the top of it."
7345280,7346280," Way heavier."
7346280,7347280," Yeah, but it doesn't matter."
7347280,7349000," It's the same control system."
7349000,7351880," No, no, no, I see what Luke's doing."
7351880,7353280," No, we couldn't do that."
7353280,7358520," But that would be such a cool business for like Roomba to expand into."
7358520,7362720," So you've got like you've got the dumb thing, but then you just."
7362720,7365120," Facility, but you just get brains."
7365120,7366600," Oh, I see what you mean."
7366600,7367600," Yeah."
7367600,7372760," So they just so because yeah, I might want new sensors and a new brain, but it's a freaking"
7372760,7373760," mop."
7373760,7377280," I don't need I don't need a whole new body."
7377280,7385840," That would actually be like a modular approach to this could be kind of cool legitimately."
7385840,7388240," There's a spot to do it."
7388240,7393440," No, it just walks out with an actual mop and bucket."
7393440,7396240," That would be amazing."
7396240,7400120," Yeah, we could instead of an arm on the top."
7400120,7401120," It's a mop."
7401120,7402720," Yeah, how much is this thing?"
7402720,7403720," Great idea."
7403720,7405880," Oh, man."
7405880,7411920," People are just linking me like random, just like every push, push, or scrubber."
7411920,7414160," No, no, this one this one looks to be actually automated."
7414160,7415160," Oh, okay."
7415160,7417640," Wow, it's from carcher."
7417640,7419960," I had a pressure washer from them from Costco."
7419960,7422600," That's all I know about them, literally all."
7422600,7427400," Oh, it looks like you could push it, I guess, which is fine."
7427400,7430600," That's whatever this device requires instruction."
7430600,7432960," Sure does request quote."
7432960,7435960," All of these things are request quote videos like it's a lot."
7435960,7437000," I want to see the video."
7437000,7438000," All right."
7438000,7439800," Ice girl to the exact same time."
7439800,7441000," Nice."
7441000,7443200," We can just skip it is a three minute video."
7443200,7445200," Ooh, docking station."
7445200,7446200," Ooh, docking station."
7446200,7447200," Wait."
7447200,7448200," Wow."
7448200,7449200," No way."
7449200,7450200," No way."
7450200,7451200," What?"
7451200,7452200," Oh, that's battery charging."
7452200,7453200," I thought that was like replacing fluid."
7453200,7454200," Oh, I'm sure it will."
7454200,7455200," Oh, shut up."
7455200,7456200," Yeah."
7456200,7457200," No way."
7457200,7458200," Okay, that's awesome."
7458200,7459200," My little room but thing does that."
7459200,7460200," Well, yeah, but this goes right into the wall."
7460200,7461200," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
7461200,7462200," That'd be sick."
7462200,7463200," That would be kind of sick."
7463200,7464200," Does it refill it?"
7464200,7465200," Tell me it refills it."
7465200,7466200," I hope so."
7466200,7467200," Yeah, wait."
7467200,7468200," Clean the tank."
7468200,7470200," That's pretty cool."
7470200,7471200," Okay."
7471200,7472200," How much does this carcher thing cost?"
7472200,7474200," We don't know because it's request quote."
7474200,7476200," And do I need a subscription service for it?"
7476200,7478800," Do I have to configure it with their cloud?"
7478800,7479800," There we go."
7479800,7480800," It fills with fresh water."
7480800,7483720," Oh, this is kind of awesome."
7483720,7487960," I love the the the hydro physics they got going on."
7487960,7488960," All right."
7488960,7489960," Okay."
7489960,7490960," All right."
7490960,7491960," Yeah, I'll take off on its own."
7491960,7496280," I'll get in touch with these guys and figure out if they have a if this will be suitable"
7496280,7497280," for my needs."
7497280,7500160," You're going to turn this channel into an automated cleaning channel."
7500160,7501160," I know, right?"
7501160,7505440," What's the thing I love about LTT is you can kind of do, you know, whatever."
7505440,7506440," Interesting things are interesting."
7506440,7508640," Yeah, interesting tack, right?"
7508640,7509640," Yeah."
7509640,7512040," Presweet function."
7512040,7514880," Pick up course dirt while scrubbing."
7514880,7516040," Thank you, little robot."
7516040,7517040," Yeah."
7517040,7519360," I just hope it's actually any good."
7519360,7522520," It does detergent dosing."
7522520,7523520," That seems neat."
7523520,7529000," It has a warning beacon just in case it's going to roll over someone playing pametin."
7529000,7530000," Wow."
7530000,7531000," Wow."
7531000,7533000," And it dries."
7533000,7534000," Yep."
7534000,7536800," It's a good dryer."
7536800,7537800," There are options."
7537800,7539720," All right."
7539720,7542920," Another thing, if you want to just throw links at me, like they currently are."
7542920,7548200," Another thing that we're trying to figure out is how we want to do like memberships and"
7548200,7550960," court rentals and stuff like that."
7550960,7556600," And there's been a few there's been a few things that I've kind of found, but I haven't"
7556600,7559360," found one that I think really fits perfectly yet."
7559360,7565800," So if you go to like a local court gym, because I have found stuff for like weightlifting"
7565800,7571840," gyms, but I guess we're going to need both at this point, but being able to rent specific"
7571840,7577520," courts and being able to rent like multiple courts at the same time and also having your"
7577520,7579320," membership potentially play into that."
7579320,7580920," We don't know how that might work yet."
7580920,7583120," Maybe you get a discount on court rental, maybe something else."
7583120,7584920," I don't know."
7584920,7589160," Being able to have a membership on this other platform, all of those types of things."
7589160,7593720," We want to ideally not make this stuff."
7593720,7594720," Court Reserve for tennis."
7594720,7595720," Boom."
7595720,7599160," This is why this is why."
7599160,7603000," Court Reserve, court reservation software."
7603000,7604000," Amazing."
7604000,7605000," I will look into this."
7605000,7608280," Thank you people."
7608280,7609280," This is kind of cool."
7609280,7614080," Apparently you teach it by just manually driving around the perimeter of the area you"
7614080,7619320," want it to clean, but it has to be free of obstacles."
7619320,7623600," So I don't know how nets would factor into that."
7623600,7626200," Well, we'll figure this out."
7626200,7627200," Yeah."
7627200,7628200," All right."
7628200,7629360," What else do you want to talk about?"
7629360,7631600," Anyway, in conclusion, fossil bad."
7631600,7632600," Yeah."
7632600,7633600," Oh my God."
7633600,7635240," We're talking about watching."
7635240,7636240," Yeah."
7636240,7637240," Yep."
7637240,7638240," Oh, the tangent."
7638240,7640240," That's pretty good."
7640240,7644480," Uh, Chinese company releases new CPU."
7644480,7645480," Yeah."
7645480,7648840," Pictures courtesy of Tom's hardware here."
7648840,7652800," Chinese company Power Leader has announced they will be entering the CPU market and unveiled"
7652800,7659880," their new chip, the Power Star P3-01105."
7659880,7668080," And obvious rebranding of the i3-0105."
7668080,7674000," Power Leader claims the CPU uses storm core architecture and made no mention of Intel"
7674000,7675640," whatsoever."
7675640,7681600," The company claims the CPU will be launching soon with an annual target of 1.5 million"
7681600,7685600," units sold."
7685600,7689240," We don't actually know anything more about it than this."
7689240,7693480," And our hope was that we could generate a bit of discussion with you guys about how"
7693480,7700280," the heck Power Leader might be getting a hold of 1.5 million chips to rebrand."
7700280,7704480," And what exactly it is that they're trying to achieve here?"
7704480,7706480," What is going on?"
7706480,7707480," Oh."
7707480,7713080," Hello, my wife."
7713080,7715760," Do you want to come say hi to Wancho?"
7715760,7716960," You never say hi to Wancho."
7716960,7719720," How come you're so, how come you're so shy?"
7719720,7724000," No, I'm going to make you come say hi to Wancho to get the key."
7724000,7729240," If you want the key, you have to come say hi to Wancho."
7729240,7731320," Yeah, you can go home."
7731320,7733000," You can go home after you say hi to Wancho."
7733000,7735160," I'm going to hold it over here."
7735160,7736160," Wow."
7736160,7739160," Just kidding."
7739160,7740560," Bye."
7740560,7742360," Bye."
7742360,7747840," All right."
7747840,7748840," What else do we want to talk about?"
7748840,7750840," Oh, yeah, yeah, right, right, right."
7750840,7756880," Oh, you guys, do they have 1.5 million compatible motherboards and ramsticks?"
7756880,7758360," I don't know."
7758360,7763360," OK, you guys haven't really given us anything here."
7763360,7767640," Man, it would be really funny if they were just like, oh, yeah, it just works with these"
7767640,7770600," boards, just the preexisting indulgence of people."
7770600,7771600," I don't know."
7771600,7776640," People are speculating factory defect CPUs, but those would never leave Intel's factory,"
7776640,7778200," which isn't in China."
7778200,7782760," So it's not like, oh, yeah, it's like a third shift thing or a fourth shift or whatever."
7782760,7788880," It's called when the factory runs an additional shift and just puts it into a truck and you"
7788880,7794280," can buy literally the exact same product that came out of the same factory, but at a tenth"
7794280,7795360," of the price or whatever."
7795360,7797440," This is obviously not that."
7797440,7800680," Some people are saying from the E-waste bin, well, right, but people would get wise and"
7800680,7804080," stop buying them before they managed to sell a million and a half."
7804080,7807960," Like, come on, guys, give me something here."
7807960,7809520," They take over a boat."
7809520,7814760," Like, if so, Intel would have reported a million and a half, subsusing."
7814760,7817040," Like that would show up on their balance sheet."
7817040,7819040," That would be on a quarterly earnings call."
7819040,7822480," Like, where are these coming from?"
7822480,7825560," Yeah, that's not the question, Sekai T-guides."
7825560,7830360," It's where is it coming from?"
7830360,7833680," My guess is closed factory, revoked factory contract kept running."
7833680,7835760," No, that's not how Intel works."
7835760,7838040," Intel's a first party manufacturer."
7838040,7840040," They make their CPUs."
7840040,7845040," There's no third party contractor that is just, you know, quietly moving CPUs out the"
7845040,7846040," door."
7846040,7847640," People do steal CPUs off the line."
7847640,7852080," You do see that from time to time, especially with qualifying samples, engineering samples."
7852080,7854360," You'll see a lot of that stuff show up."
7854360,7861280," But in terms of retail chips, that's not really a thing."
7861280,7864880," I just didn't, you know, Intel has a franchise program."
7864880,7865880," Okay."
7865880,7871880," All right, you guys are just teasing now."
7871880,7876480," I mean, we've got some people sort of speculating that it could be political."
7876480,7883920," I mean, there has been the whole back and forth over just the semiconductor industry in general"
7883920,7885240," between the US and China."
7885240,7889080," There was that whole thing earlier this week where like, there was speculation that the"
7889080,7895160," US would rather blow up TSMC than let China have it, which is bad."
7895160,7901320," By the way, just sure I want to make my position clear on that."
7901320,7902320," Simple answer."
7902320,7905680," They're lying, but like to what end?"
7905680,7909080," What's the, what's the point of lying about this?"
7909080,7917600," Like it just looks, yeah, I don't, I just don't get this."
7917600,7918600," Which is a hoax."
7918600,7919600," Yeah."
7919600,7920600," Okay."
7920600,7922080," Well, we don't know."
7922080,7923080," Nobody."
7923080,7927960," Yeah, nobody seems to have a clear idea of what exactly the crap is going on here."
7927960,7931600," I thought maybe someone, I thought maybe someone knew."
7931600,7932600," Okay."
7932600,7934600," All right."
7934600,7935600," Cool."
7935600,7938240," What else you want to talk about?"
7938240,7940240," I need to do this really quick."
7940240,7941240," Oh, all right."
7941240,7943720," Oh, and then I'm down to talk about whatever."
7943720,7952200," I want to talk about the $615,000 in penalties for companies that faked anti net neutrality"
7952200,7953200," comments."
7953200,7954200," Yeah."
7954200,7955200," What's going on with that?"
7955200,7956200," Okay."
7956200,7958000," This is wild."
7958000,7961920," This is like some next level BS."
7961920,7971600," This explains not all, but at least some of how obviously beneficial things like net neutrality,"
7971600,7978720," like right to repair, don't just immediately happen where everyone just goes, Oh yeah,"
7978720,7980120," that would be good."
7980120,7981920," Let's do that."
7981920,7983360," Let's talk about this."
7983360,7992440," Three companies LCX digital media lead ID and efficient IFFICINT, Inc. were hired by"
7992440,7997800," the broadband industry to enroll consumers in a campaign to repeal net neutrality rules"
7997800,7999440," in 2017."
7999440,8007400," Instead, these companies submitted a combined 3.8 million fake responses to the FCC using"
8007400,8014320," the identities and personal information of real people without their knowledge or consent."
8014320,8023600," So basically, if you were actually a real person who got convinced somehow that net neutrality"
8023600,8028480," was a bad idea and was bad, congratulations."
8028480,8030000," You played yourself."
8030000,8035080," You are as clever as a bot."
8035080,8037000," Net neutrality is obvious."
8037000,8041480," It is obvious that it needs to be a thing."
8041480,8045840," And because it's so obvious, these companies clearly thought, you know what, we are never"
8045840,8047600," going to convince enough people of this."
8047600,8048600," Yeah."
8048600,8049600," So we just need to fake it."
8049600,8050600," So we just need to fake it."
8050600,8055160," These companies have agreed to pay a total of $615,000 worth of penalties."
8055160,8058600," So this is just over $6 per false representation."
8058600,8060680," Wait, no, that doesn't seem right."
8060680,8062480," 3.8 million fake responses."
8062480,8064480," Forget that math."
8064480,8066240," They were not the only companies involved."
8066240,8069560," And this is actually the second batch of penalty agreements secured by the New York"
8069560,8071120," Attorney General."
8071120,8076480," These allegations first came to light in 2021, but the head of the FCC at the time at GPI"
8076480,8080320," was anti-net neutrality and fought attempts to investigate."
8080320,8082520," He was awful."
8082520,8084160," Like the worst."
8084160,8087560," Like actually just paid chill."
8087560,8088560," Yep."
8088560,8092800," Authorities were unable to substantiate that the big ISPs who paid for these fake comments"
8092800,8098680," had direct knowledge of the fraud, and thus they have not been held liable."
8098680,8101560," 600 and $615,000?"
8101560,8104280," It feels very low."
8104280,8106160," That's like cost of doing business."
8106160,8107160," Yep."
8107160,8108160," This is disgusting."
8108160,8113600," These companies shouldn't be allowed to exist anymore, in my opinion."
8113600,8114600," They're just closed."
8114600,8115600," What's that?"
8115600,8119480," I don't think these companies should be allowed to exist anymore."
8119480,8120480," Yeah."
8120480,8126440," I mean, I don't, I just don't understand why you can have like how many grams of weed"
8126440,8130120," or whatever and you can go to jail."
8130120,8131120," Yeah."
8131120,8132120," Like."
8132120,8133120," Just fraud."
8133120,8137480," That's not a big deal."
8137480,8138480," Yeah."
8138480,8139480," What?"
8139480,8140480," Yeah."
8140480,8145000," Like the amount of the amount of money that was at stake in this net neutrality."
8145000,8146720," Oh, yeah."
8146720,8148160," In this net neutrality argument."
8148160,8149160," And like what?"
8149160,8151080," Are they going to overturn it now?"
8151080,8152720," Yeah."
8152720,8153720," This is hilarious."
8153720,8156880," Lapsed memory goes, the worst part is that this was known while it was happening."
8156880,8157880," Yeah."
8157880,8159080," He specifically blocked any investigation."
8159080,8160080," Yeah."
8160080,8161080," Exactly."
8161080,8162080," Yeah."
8162080,8163080," Yeah."
8163080,8164840," We got people talking about like 650 grand is less than what some companies will pay for"
8164840,8166560," like a TV advertising spot."
8166560,8167560," 200%."
8167560,8168880," Think about Super Bowl spots."
8168880,8169880," Yeah."
8169880,8170880," Yeah."
8170880,8171880," Yeah."
8171880,8173920," And 600k between three companies."
8173920,8176680," Like, okay."
8176680,8178320," Yeah."
8178320,8184400," A hunter layer is saying in my state anything over announced is punishable by up to 20 years"
8184400,8185640," and it's disgusting."
8185640,8186640," Yeah."
8186640,8187640," 100%."
8187640,8190200," Like why is white collar crime just fine?"
8190200,8191200," It's okay."
8191200,8194280," Isn't Elizabeth Holmes like still not in jail?"
8194280,8197160," Who's that?"
8197160,8199160," The Theranos."
8199160,8200160," Oh really?"
8200160,8201160," She's not?"
8201160,8202640," I thought she was."
8202640,8206960," Has avoided starting her more than 11 year prison sentence on Thursday by deploying the"
8206960,8211720," same legal maneuver that enabled her co-conspirator in the blood testing hoax to remain free for an"
8211720,8213720," additional month."
8213720,8214720," Geez."
8214720,8215720," Okay."
8215720,8224120," Cause that would be an option if you had, you know, an ounce of weed in your bag."
8224120,8232360," Anyways, let's move on."
8232360,8234640," I want to talk about the Boink update."
8234640,8238000," LTT currently in second place."
8238000,8239000," Doing good."
8239000,8245400," But, but, but we will likely lose that spot when the next two projects come online."
8245400,8250840," So if you guys want to join our Boink team, we are currently behind a non tech."
8250840,8252320," Sign ups are open for prizes."
8252320,8255520," We'll be made really more people would be appreciated."
8255520,8259480," We need people running number fields at home and Einstein at home."
8259480,8261640," So go, go, go check it out guys."
8261640,8262640," You can get more information."
8262640,8263640," Hopefully at the link below."
8263640,8265920," Do we have a link below to that Dan?"
8265920,8266920," Hopefully we do."
8266920,8267880," Otherwise I check it out on the forum."
8267880,8269600," You guys can learn more there."
8269600,8272440," And I think that's pretty much it for the topics."
8272440,8275360," Should we switch over to Wenshow after dark?"
8275360,8276360," Yeah."
8276360,8280760," Dropped my fidget toy."
8280760,8284200," How are your fingers doing over there Dan?"
8284200,8287000," Painful fingers."
8287000,8288560," My fingers are painful."
8288560,8289560," My fingers hurt."
8289560,8291800," Well now your back's gonna hurt."
8291800,8294160," You just pulled landscaping duty."
8294160,8296680," It's a line from Happy Galmarns."
8296680,8298480," I can't take credit for that."
8298480,8301120," Ben Stiller in that movie is freaking hilarious."
8301120,8303720," That's pretty great."
8303720,8304720," Okay."
8304720,8311000," Let's go."
8311000,8313200," Let's go."
8313200,8315000," Okay first up here."
8315000,8319760," When you were leading a team of house painters, how many teams?"
8319760,8320760," Wow."
8320760,8321760," I'm muted."
8321760,8327440," When you were leading a team of house painters, how did you wow customers and manage quality?"
8327440,8329000," Any stories from that era?"
8329000,8333240," He's starting his own painting franchise six months ago with five painters."
8333240,8335400," Ooh."
8335400,8338400," How did you wow customers?"
8338400,8344240," I mean really I don't know that I ever wowed anyone."
8344240,8352040," We obviously did our best and you know cared about quality."
8352040,8353800," I didn't have a huge team."
8353800,8356320," The biggest my team ever was was me plus two."
8356320,8359400," So I ended up doing a lot more of the painting myself than I was supposed to."
8359400,8365840," That wasn't a particularly good manager."
8365840,8371160," So I was there on site most of the time unless I was doing quotes."
8371160,8374520," So managing quality was fairly easy."
8374520,8380920," In terms of how to wow people, I mean honestly speaking from both sides, I'd say that if"
8380920,8386600," you're a contractor who shows up within an hour of when you say you will, you're going"
8386600,8389160," to wow the customer."
8389160,8391000," Just like wow."
8391000,8393360," If you don't do like a terrible job."
8393360,8399320," Yeah, I had a guy we just kind of gave up on ever getting around to moving the trampoline"
8399320,8402320," from the old place to the new place."
8402320,8408000," And Yvonne found a guy on Facebook marketplace who does it for like 200 bucks or something"
8408000,8409000," like that."
8409000,8412280," And she was like, you know what, I'm just going to do this so that you know one of the"
8412280,8415840," kids has a birthday party coming up so they can all jump and like I was not going to have"
8415840,8422880," an opportunity to get it done and the guy showed up and did it at the agreed rate and"
8422880,8428040," I tipped him like 50 bucks or something like that because wow, I couldn't believe it."
8428040,8433520," You actually did it."
8433520,8436520," I still don't have a pool."
8436520,8441600," You're going to have us roll the trampoline down the street, weren't you?"
8441600,8443520," Yeah, that was my plan."
8443520,8449200," Yeah, I wasn't actually going to retreat you, but I was going to have Luke help me."
8449200,8450640," Yeah, I probably would have been there."
8450640,8452120," The return of channel super fun."
8452120,8454840," Lice and Luke try to roll the trampoline."
8454840,8458800," I wanted to do it in the snow because I think when we're going down the hill, we could just"
8458800,8461080," kind of slide it."
8461080,8464320," That would have actually been so much fun."
8464320,8466480," Oh, man."
8466480,8467480," Okay."
8467480,8468960," That's so good."
8468960,8475480," Hey LD recently started a new job with much more leeway for my own decision making, leaving"
8475480,8477880," behind a job where I was micromanaged."
8477880,8486680," Any advice for adjusting to this change, finding myself struggling?"
8486680,8488920," You have to make decisions."
8488920,8492080," You're going to make wrong decisions sometimes."
8492080,8494400," Have reasons for why you made your decision."
8494400,8497560," I guess someone's like, this went really poorly."
8497560,8498760," Why did you do this?"
8498760,8502720," Be able to justify it and be like, yeah, I mean, now that we've seen it gone poorly,"
8502720,8503720," it makes sense."
8503720,8506520," But when I was originally making the decision, this is why I made it."
8506520,8512080," And you know, if I didn't have the information of this going poorly and I went back to it"
8512080,8515560," and I had this original information, I would still make that decision."
8515560,8518440," If you can defend it to that level, then like it is what it is."
8518440,8520160," Just got to keep moving."
8520160,8522960," But yeah, understand that you're going to make mistakes and now they're going to be"
8522960,8524160," on you and that's okay."
8524160,8529840," Hi, Beeps was looking for a video of yours from 2019."
8529840,8534240," Christmas Buyers Guide, I believe, made my first computer with that."
8534240,8535680," Can't find it anywhere."
8535680,8538680," Is it common for you to delete old videos?"
8538680,8543040," No, it's very uncommon for us to delete old videos."
8543040,8549880," I think only a handful of actually published videos have ever been deleted."
8549880,8554520," One of them included a detailed floor plan of my old house, for example, that just kind"
8554520,8559640," of seemed ill-advised."
8559640,8560640," What else?"
8560640,8563720," Yeah, really not much."
8563720,8567080," Oh, we pulled that."
8567080,8575440," See, I don't even remember that that health monitoring ring, Aura, Aura, Aura."
8575440,8581640," We pulled the video and they were all nipped about it and we offered to make good and they"
8581640,8584800," weren't happy with it and we were like, \"Okay.\""
8584800,8585800," I think they wanted to pull."
8585800,8586800," I don't know."
8586800,8590680," I can't even remember exactly what happened, but basically, I don't think it was really"
8590680,8591680," anyone's fault."
8591680,8593880," It just didn't work out so we pulled the video."
8593880,8595600," Really, really not many."
8595600,8596600," It's very uncommon."
8596600,8597600," Yeah."
8597600,8600160," If you can't find it, it's more likely that you just can't find it."
8600160,8601760," Yeah, the title is something different."
8601760,8605280," There's like 4,000 videos on the LTT channel or something like that."
8605280,8609920," It's not a surprise that it's hard to track down a particular one."
8609920,8611920," Okay, let's see."
8611920,8614360," Oh, should have done that."
8614360,8617080," Hey, Dale, long-time watcher, first-time caller."
8617080,8621640," I'm going to be wrapping up my first ever custom hard-line water cooling build in the"
8621640,8623120," next couple of weeks."
8623120,8627480," Any chance of a new review my build soon?"
8627480,8629440," Oh, interesting."
8629440,8630440," Yeah."
8630440,8637080," We ask people to submit bad builds, but I guess we've never actually asked the communities"
8637080,8640240," to submit their best builds."
8640240,8641240," Maybe we should do that."
8641240,8642240," We used to do that."
8642240,8644920," Well, no, we used to do that on WAN show, actually."
8644920,8645920," That's true."
8645920,8650000," Super long-time ago, Build of the Week was a thing."
8650000,8651000," Yeah."
8651000,8652000," Huh."
8652000,8656360," Maybe it's a potential idea for the reaction channel."
8656360,8657360," Yeah."
8657360,8658360," Reaction channel."
8658360,8659360," Yeah."
8659360,8660360," Hi, LLD."
8660360,8665320," I love listening to you guys on Saturdays when I'm out delivering mail."
8665320,8668960," My PC is 20 feet away from the TV in my living room."
8668960,8671960," What is the easiest option to use my PC on my TV?"
8671960,8674040," 20-foot HDMI cable?"
8674040,8675320," Yeah, pretty much."
8675320,8679320," You might need to go optical, especially if you're running HDMI 2.1 at that kind of a"
8679320,8680320," distance."
8680320,8684720," But I would personally just go with an active USB cable."
8684720,8688520," You might be able to do 20 feet if you're just doing USB 2."
8688520,8695520," And then a powered hub so that you can run mouse and keyboard or a mouse and game controller"
8695520,8699040," receiver, whatever."
8699040,8703840," And then I would go with probably an optical HDMI 2.1 cable, assuming you want to do like"
8703840,8706280," 4K 120 Hertz or something like that."
8706280,8710520," By the way, we missed a topic that is actually kind of a big one."
8710520,8712280," We could just do this real quick here."
8712280,8713280," Yeah."
8713280,8717720," But the former Uber CSO was found guilty of concealing a data breach."
8717720,8722880," And something, something, basically six years in prison, I think."
8722880,8724760," I thought we talked about this last week."
8724760,8728120," No, I don't think we did."
8728120,8730360," Oh, okay."
8730360,8737440," Yeah, but basically covered up a 2016 hack that compromised the data of 57 million users,"
8737440,8740000," including 600,000 driver's licenses."
8740000,8741000," Yikes."
8741000,8742480," That's really rough."
8742480,8745240," So they withheld information about the incident."
8745240,8750880," And it was only investigated and disclosed in late 2017 when Uber became under new management."
8750880,8756480," He actually got another security chief position in CloudFlare in 2018, only stepping down in"
8756480,8759480," 2022 to prepare for his trial."
8759480,8760480," Yikes."
8760480,8762480," That's brutal."
8762480,8765360," Yeah, that's rough."
8765360,8766360," I'm surprised."
8766360,8769920," Nothing here is going towards the company."
8769920,8771920," But is what it is?"
8771920,8771960," Yeah."
8772960,8776880," All right, Dan hit me."
8776880,8778520," Apparently we just mentioned it last week."
8778520,8782360," We didn't go into the topic."
8782360,8784680," Back to curated."
8784680,8790040," Despite early excitement, I haven't seen much buzz around the wind GPD for lately."
8790040,8794560," How do you think it compares to the ROG ally as a portable Windows PC from your time with"
8794560,8796080," both?"
8796080,8797080," Other than price."
8797080,8799360," Oh, man."
8799360,8800920," Price matters a lot."
8800920,8805920," And the hardware in the ally is a lot faster."
8805920,8811240," The smaller brands, the GPDs, the INEOs, the 1X players of the world, they've got it."
8811240,8817080," They're going to have to have 7,000 series rise in in order to compete with what ASUS"
8817080,8821440," is doing with the ally and with what Valve is doing with the Steam Deck quite frankly,"
8821440,8823600," even though that's even older hardware."
8823600,8829600," As we found in our review of the ally, it still performs surprisingly well, especially in"
8829600,8831520," lower power envelopes."
8831520,8836600," And you've got to imagine that a big part of that is thanks to the optimizations that"
8836600,8843680," Valve is able to make by just baking their own OS, taking their time, working through"
8843680,8848520," the problems and really squeezing the most out of that hardware."
8848520,8855320," Something that we didn't touch on, like did not hit in our review and should have, is"
8855320,8860720," the differences between sleep on Windows and on the Steam Deck."
8860720,8862960," Just instant sleep, instant wake."
8862960,8869160," It's a more console-like experience is much more seamless on the Steam Deck, whereas on"
8869160,8872680," Windows it's like rough."
8872680,8874480," Yeah, exactly."
8874480,8880680," You're not really able to suspend it in the same way."
8880680,8885680," With more employees in the Labs building, how many times per hour are people and equipment"
8885680,8887080," moving back and forth?"
8887080,8890520," Are you going to have to hire someone just to drive a truck between the buildings?"
8890520,8892120," I mean, it's- Oh, you mean between buildings?"
8892120,8893120," I thought you just- It's constant."
8893120,8895920," Inside the lab, we work in a hallway."
8895920,8896920," Oh my god."
8896920,8898520," There's a lot of people that work there."
8898520,8902760," You start to realize that when you work in a hallway, um- Yeah, like 5% of the people you"
8902760,8903760," recognize."
8903760,8909320," It's fantastic when people decide to have impromptu meetings in the middle of our hallway."
8909320,8910320," It's not that bad."
8910320,8911320," I'm just complaining."
8911320,8913400," Uh- Yeah, I don't know."
8913400,8917360," I don't see it often personally, like needing to get things between the buildings."
8917360,8921960," The only thing I normally need to get between the buildings is myself, um, so I don't-"
8921960,8927400," not a very good person to answer this, but from- from my observation point, it's really"
8927400,8928880," not that bad."
8928880,8934440," Was there any lifespan testing on the stick locks?"
8934440,8939240," Um, I mean, they're made of a very durable silicone rubber."
8939240,8940240," Yeah."
8940240,8942840," Tell you what, if they fail, I got you."
8942840,8943840," Oh, sorry."
8943840,8944840," That's not what it is."
8944840,8945840," Trust me, bro."
8945840,8946840," That's the one."
8946840,8949720," That would be good on a shirt."
8949720,8953960," I recently saw a video about linking JetGPT to Home Assistant."
8953960,8958080," It can't control anything yet, but it's only a matter of time."
8958080,8963080," Minus, would you trust an LLM AI with keys to your home automation?"
8963080,8964960," Well, it depends, right?"
8964960,8972600," Um, because as long as it's- oh, yeah, so hold on a second."
8972600,8977920," No, I don't want anything that is web-based."
8977920,8978920," You can self-host."
8978920,8982640," Oh, but you can self-host chat GPT."
8982640,8986320," Not chat, but there are multiple forms of it."
8986320,8991200," I was specifically responding to chat GPT, but if I was talking about in general an LLM,"
8991200,8992560," yeah, I don't see why not."
8992560,8996320," As long as I'm self-hosting it, as long as I'm the one who controls who is allowed to"
8996320,8999440," interface with it, I mean, it's not actually sentient."
8999440,9004520," I think, yeah, I think I was going to say, I think what the, the, the, the merch message"
9004520,9008720," is asking is like, are you going to trust it to not like, I can't let you do that, Dave,"
9008720,9010880," to your house?"
9010880,9014720," Yeah, I'm not worried about that."
9014720,9015720," Yeah."
9015720,9019800," So, Linus, do you ever troll your family with automation?"
9019800,9023440," My wife will leave every light in the house on."
9023440,9026880," When she does, every speaker plays a song every light in the house."
9026880,9029520," She hates country."
9029520,9034720," Um, I like staying in my marriage for the most part."
9034720,9036440," I just had put it in my car."
9036440,9037440," That's actually hilarious."
9037440,9039000," I mean, it's so funny."
9039000,9040000," Oh my goodness."
9040000,9041640," You say that, but then what was that?"
9041640,9043360," Like, when she came to pick up the key?"
9043360,9044360," Oh, yeah, it's a bugginger."
9044360,9045360," Okay."
9045360,9047440," He troll, he troll, he trolls his family."
9047440,9048440," Why not use your house?"
9048440,9049440," The time."
9049440,9052280," Yeah, I don't know if I've ever really done it."
9052280,9053280," You know what?"
9053280,9058760," I would say that the very installation of smart switches is trolling my wife at this"
9058760,9059760," point."
9059760,9060760," Yeah."
9060760,9065560," The fact that they are still in the house and, you know, not all working properly because"
9065560,9070800," I think it's something to do with just how much communication those particular switches"
9070800,9072720," spam out onto the network."
9072720,9074880," Um, the, the controller just gets overwhelmed."
9074880,9078040," I think we've kind of narrowed it, narrowed down what the problem is."
9078040,9080320," They just can't handle such a big install."
9080320,9082720," Um, she's not happy."
9082720,9083720," So you know what?"
9083720,9088800," Once I've got everything set up, if those new InnaVelli ones work out great, yeah, maybe."
9088800,9091800," But for now, no, I don't have a death wish."
9091800,9095240," Or at least I don't wish to sleep in the guest room."
9095240,9096240," Yeah."
9096240,9097240," Yeah."
9097240,9098240," Yeah."
9098240,9100240," What is the next big step in the lab?"
9100240,9102520," What are you most excited about getting from the lab?"
9102520,9108040," The most exciting thing for me that I expect to get from the lab is way more roundups."
9108040,9118440," Like, who wants a review of the EVGA B450 watt semi module?"
9118440,9124320," No, no, I want to know what the best power supply under $35 is."
9124320,9127720," That's what I, that's all I actually care about."
9127720,9134680," And so once we're, once we're testing in bulk, I want to do way more content like that."
9134680,9139200," What is the best sounding true wireless earphone?"
9139200,9141400," Just everything else aside."
9141400,9146520," We could, we'll talk about that other stuff, but give me a headline and give me real data"
9146520,9147520," to back it up."
9147520,9150960," I don't want just like BS listicles, you know?"
9150960,9152440," Yeah."
9152440,9153720," Really excited about that."
9153720,9157320," And the PSU tester being online is definitely something I'm super excited about."
9157320,9159840," We're actually going to be shooting a lab update on Monday."
9159840,9163680," We're going to be, we've actually printed things with the metal 3D printer now."
9163680,9166360," So I'll be showing you guys some, some print results."
9166360,9171600," We're, we've got the power supply tester, the RF chamber, the floor is in."
9171600,9175240," So at the end of the RF chamber video, the floor wasn't actually in because we, we wanted"
9175240,9177160," to shoot while they were installing."
9177160,9181200," So we could give you guys a better look at how it was going together."
9181200,9183680," So you're going to see in the lab update, we've got the floor in now."
9183680,9186840," We're going to talk a little bit more about the cellular network testing gear that we're"
9186840,9187840," going to be putting in there."
9187840,9188840," RF chamber super cool man."
9188840,9192560," You want to know something wild?"
9192560,9199040," You know how in science class, you learn that just, you know, a metal enclosure is a"
9199040,9200040," fair day cage."
9200040,9201040," Yeah."
9201040,9202800," Well, not all fair day cages are created equal."
9202800,9207160," Like, you know how you can put your cell phone in the microwave and you'll still get a text,"
9207160,9210920," even though it's a fair day cage, but, but that fair day cage is designed for a particular"
9210920,9219160," there. Yeah, I guess how would I even describe this, like particular type of radiation."
9219160,9220160," Yeah."
9220160,9222160," And it's, it's not perfect for everything."
9222160,9229360," And so what's really cool is the man, the precision with which they have to be built"
9229360,9232040," just mind blowing."
9232040,9236260," There's this, there's this like baffle, this like pass through that's designed for you"
9236260,9240900," to put your optical cables through so that you can actually get data inside it."
9240900,9246300," And it's engineered so tightly that if you take just like a wire and just stick it through"
9246300,9253420," it, the background noise goes from like minus 150, don't quote me on these numbers."
9253420,9257540," You'll see it in the video, like minus 150 dB to like set minus 70."
9257540,9258540," Yeah."
9258540,9263340," Like huge, huge difference just from putting a wire through a hole in this whole room that"
9263340,9264340," we're in."
9264340,9265340," Absolutely mind blowing."
9265340,9266340," It's pretty cool."
9266340,9267340," Yeah."
9267340,9268340," Yeah."
9268340,9271180," We are going to be able to test some cool stuff though."
9271180,9272180," Matt, the."
9272180,9273820," I'm very excited to throw my phone at it."
9273820,9274900," I already talked to them about it."
9274900,9284020," Like the Wi-Fi, the Wi-Fi router market has had what for objective testing."
9284020,9285020," Yeah."
9285020,9286020," What?"
9286020,9287020," Well, there's no thing."
9287020,9288820," What fricking Wi-Fi access point do you buy?"
9288820,9289820," Yeah."
9289820,9290820," I don't know."
9290820,9291820," Who knows?"
9291820,9293820," He's reading on a spec sheet and hoping."
9293820,9300700," Hey, LLD."
9300700,9304860," I worked for Zeku, the in-house chip company for Oppo."
9304860,9306500," Is it Ziku or Zeku?"
9306500,9307500," I'm not sure."
9307500,9308500," I don't think it matters anymore."
9308500,9309500," Let's do both."
9309500,9313060," Ziku just closed yesterday without any warning."
9313060,9316780," Why do you think Oppo chose now to leave the custom chip race?"
9316780,9318860," We have produced two working chips."
9318860,9322660," Honestly, for me, the bigger question is why they thought they should enter the custom"
9322660,9323660," chip race."
9323660,9327180," It's really challenging."
9327180,9337140," There's a reason that there's only, I mean, what I guess we could say, Apple, Qualcomm,"
9337140,9342260," MediaTac actually has some decent designs these days, don't they?"
9342260,9349180," There's only a handful of really successful ARM integrators and the ones that are successful"
9349180,9354060," these days are adding a lot of special sauce to their designs, making them very custom"
9354060,9360900," rather than just taking ARM core IP and putting it onto a CPU."
9360900,9367900," If you want to be competitive, yeah, Google, Google's another one."
9367900,9370300," It's really tough."
9370300,9376180," And I don't see a company like Oppo, even at their scale, I don't see it making sense"
9376180,9380260," for them to try to develop their own chip IP."
9380260,9381860," I don't get it."
9381860,9385820," It's just, it's so hard."
9385820,9391020," Okay, last curated one I've got here."
9391020,9393020," Hi, when dot dll."
9393020,9396740," When looking at channel metrics, how do you take into account users that lie about their"
9396740,9397740," age?"
9397740,9402260," Old account created while underage, currently underage, privacy or humor reasons?"
9402260,9403260," We can't."
9403260,9407180," We just assume that, well, okay, well, we can't."
9407180,9413460," Google definitely has mechanisms in place to try to account for that."
9413460,9419500," They will profile you based on the kind of content that you look at and the kind of behavior"
9419500,9420940," that you exhibit."
9420940,9424220," But other than that, it's all just a best guess, right?"
9424220,9426380," It's a heck of a lot better than what we had before."
9426380,9431180," That's what's turned Google into such an advertising juggernaut is newspapers and magazines"
9431180,9432180," were just guessing."
9432180,9434180," They don't actually know who's reading them."
9434180,9439380," I mean, Cosmo, you know, made a pretty educated guess that it's probably mostly women reading"
9439380,9442100," it, but they couldn't actually verify that."
9442100,9446700," Well, in the same way, Google is making a pretty good guess that, you know, someone"
9446700,9452020," who self identifies as a 45 year old man is probably a 45 year old man because who would"
9452020,9453020," lie about that?"
9453020,9456940," Do you want to be a 45 year old man?"
9456940,9457940," Not necessarily."
9457940,9462500," Victor's probably also a lot of habits with like, if you're going to lie about your age,"
9462500,9467900," you're either going to pick like a hundred or just barely acceptable because why bother"
9467900,9468900," scroll further?"
9468900,9469900," Yeah."
9469900,9472140," So like, yeah, I don't know."
9472140,9475460," Okay, that's all we got for curated right now."
9475460,9479100," Let's go through some of these potentials that might be spicy."
9479100,9481100," Yeah, good luck, everybody."
9481100,9482100," Have fun."
9482100,9487620," Thanks for champion consumer rights, right to repair and calling out bad company behaviors."
9487620,9493220," Why not call out Valve more for doing some things like locking in proprietary modding"
9493220,9494220," and DRM?"
9494220,9497020," Wasn't even sure they did that, honestly."
9497020,9501420," Um, well DRM isn't bad."
9501420,9508060," DRM, invasive DRM or that compromises your privacy."
9508060,9509060," DRM is bad."
9509060,9510060," We're always online."
9510060,9513180," Root kits are bad, right?"
9513180,9515900," But DRM is not inherently bad."
9515900,9521460," DRM is like, like, should I also criticize Walmart for having security guards standing"
9521460,9525500," at the exit to, you know, check your receipt or Costco?"
9525500,9526500," Sorry."
9526500,9529980," Costco having someone standing at the exit to check your receipt."
9529980,9531260," That's kind of DRM."
9531260,9532700," It's like, it's anti theft, right?"
9532700,9534060," Like it's not."
9534060,9540420," Um, I think, I think Valve does enough things right that whether they deserve it or not,"
9540420,9542460," they get a lot of free passes."
9542460,9547860," The way that they turn a blind eye to Skins gambling is absolutely the most egregious"
9547860,9552380," thing that they're engaging in for profit and just, you know, ethics be damned."
9552380,9553380," Um, yeah."
9553380,9556020," Well, that's also like that type of activity."
9556020,9560460," I know this is not exactly the same thing, but that type of activity went from like,"
9560460,9566700," like you could never talk about gambling in relation to sports the whole time I was growing"
9566700,9568100," up."
9568100,9571700," And now the like main advertisers of all of them are gambling websites."
9571700,9573140," Yeah, it's kind of wild right now."
9573140,9577500," Like the world just like gave up on gambling, which is very interesting to me."
9577500,9578500," Kind of depressing."
9578500,9579500," Yeah."
9579500,9585300," People are saying, yeah, DRM in theory isn't bad, but it precludes people running stuff."
9585300,9588020," Wait, it precludes people running stuff."
9588020,9589700," However they want, it's all bad."
9589700,9592460," No, I can't say that I actually agree."
9592460,9595540," Someone said it's bad when it's no longer supported, but my understanding is Valve came"
9595540,9599740," out and basically said, yeah, we'll turn it all off if we ever closed steam."
9599740,9601900," I don't know that that's actually in their user agreement."
9601900,9603860," I don't know how that works with third party developers."
9603860,9610580," Clearly steam has grown beyond Valve's wildest dreams when they were first developing it."
9610580,9614780," I guess there's plenty of time for us to be outraged when that happens and it could happen."
9614780,9617340," Like I have no idea what Valve's ownership structure is."
9617340,9618340," Does anybody know?"
9618340,9620340," They're privately held."
9620340,9622900," Presumably Mr. Newell still owns a significant amount of it."
9622900,9625060," He's not getting any younger."
9625060,9628460," Like when Gabe Newell dies to steam shut down."
9628460,9631260," I actually don't, it's not impossible."
9631260,9632260," No idea."
9632260,9633260," It's improbable."
9633260,9634260," Highly."
9634260,9636100," But it is not impossible."
9636100,9637100," Right."
9637100,9640540," Like this is not a publicly held company."
9640540,9643540," There's no guarantee of continuity here."
9643540,9649740," I can all hope it stands around for a little while, I guess."
9649740,9650740," Let's see."
9650740,9652340," I'll archive that one."
9652340,9657180," Watching since 2015 and LTT helped me feel comfy switching jobs into the tech sector"
9657180,9658180," from teaching."
9658180,9662380," Still dealing with imposter syndrome, but curious what certifications or knowledge would LMG"
9662380,9667580," expect for a systems administrator?"
9667580,9669500," You hired for it."
9669500,9674260," Yeah, I mean we looked for like a bunch of different stuff."
9674260,9676140," I don't know if the listing is still up."
9676140,9677140," It's probably down now."
9677140,9680740," But we looked for a bunch of different stuff, but kind of the main thing we were looking"
9680740,9686100," for, which is pretty normal for us, was experience or portfolio."
9686100,9689580," Obviously, you're not necessarily going to have an amazing portfolio for that position."
9689580,9691180," You might, but I doubt it."
9691180,9694340," I don't know how you'd like represent it very easily."
9694340,9698140," You could, but yeah, it would be kind of tough."
9698140,9700300," But yeah, we mostly looked for experience."
9700300,9702860," What have you worked with?"
9702860,9706580," We did consider a bunch of different certifications and stuff though, but there's like, there's"
9706580,9716060," so many that that specific space is just like absolutely covered with the."
9716060,9719580," And most jobs will list the ones they actually care about."
9719580,9721140," So I don't know."
9721140,9723340," I would just look into that."
9723340,9726940," Oops, we're all doing much messages."
9726940,9727940," Hi, Linus and Luke."
9727940,9729220," Grateful for you."
9729220,9733140," You have talked about missing features, but have you come across any apps or creative"
9733140,9739220," solutions that have been fundamentally changing your daily routine for the better?"
9739220,9741180," Hmm."
9741180,9754020," I mean, reminders were a big thing for me when those showed up on smartphones."
9754020,9755020," The clock app."
9755020,9756020," Yeah, I mean."
9756020,9757540," Be able to set alarms."
9757540,9763100," I like the clock app that starts Google routines at my alarm times."
9763100,9764420," Turns on all my lights."
9764420,9770300," I have an app called food checklist that is if maintained well, which we do a pretty good"
9770300,9776900," job of kind of indispensable for shopping, we don't track anything in our fridge on it."
9776900,9780380," You can, but we don't just because the in and out is so fast."
9780380,9786460," Yeah, we'd spend more time on our phones than actually like, you know, cooking."
9786460,9792540," But for the freezer, it's great because before we were just awful about, you know, buying"
9792540,9795100," some like pre-done meal thing."
9795100,9796100," Dumping it in there."
9796100,9797980," Not using it, buying another one."
9797980,9798980," Exactly."
9798980,9799980," Exactly."
9799980,9805740," It's full and we'd be like, holy crap, we have like nine of those pizza making kits."
9805740,9807940," Why have we not made pizza in the last six months?"
9807940,9809380," It's ridiculous, right?"
9809380,9812540," Yeah, everyone should make pizza once a month."
9812540,9817900," The thing that actually triggered it, I think, is Yvonne came back from Costco with a two"
9817900,9823220," pack of cinnamon raisin bread while her parents also bought us a two pack of cinnamon raisin"
9823220,9824220," bread."
9824220,9826220," And I think there were already like five or six loaves in the freezer."
9826220,9827220," And I was like, okay, this is."
9827220,9828220," We need a solution."
9828220,9829220," Yeah."
9829220,9830220," We need to continue."
9830220,9833340," And it's partially my fault because I'm super bingy."
9833340,9837980," So I once ate an entire loaf of that in one sitting."
9837980,9838980," Yeah."
9838980,9839980," One sitting."
9839980,9844180," And so when I'm at like my peak consumption of something, you actually cannot keep it in"
9844180,9845820," stock in the house."
9845820,9849860," And then I'll just go cold on it and stop eating it."
9849860,9854340," And then if you just keep like dumbly buying one, I don't mean dumbly like intelligence"
9854340,9860580," dumb, like just kind of like autopilot buying them every time you go shopping, which would"
9860580,9863020," have been a perfectly reasonable thing to do."
9863020,9864980," And it's going to pile up."
9864980,9870060," You know, and if you have no way of knowing what's in the freezer because, okay, you try"
9870060,9875860," having three kids and running a company and like every crap other thing that Yvonne does,"
9875860,9880860," you know, you'd forget to check the freezer before you go shopping too."
9880860,9881860," It happens."
9881860,9882860," So yeah, food checklist."
9882860,9883860," It's kind of great."
9883860,9886980," And I think it was a one time lifetime purchase."
9886980,9889260," I don't think it's a subscription anymore."
9889260,9892860," They also have a subscription option obviously, but I was like, no, it's stupid."
9892860,9894860," So I bought the one time thing."
9894860,9897340," Hey, Ellen L."
9897340,9901180," My wife and daughter are starting a YouTube channel non tech."
9901180,9906740," At what point in their subscriber ramp should they start to work with Flowplane zero subscribers,"
9906740,9908780," 1000 10,000 more?"
9908780,9913140," I'd say if it's any earlier than like a hundred or a couple hundred thousand, it's probably"
9913140,9914980," not going to be very effective."
9914980,9919860," The thing is that you've got to build an audience before you can monetize an audience."
9919860,9925700," You actually cannot put the cart in front of the horse and you're only going to be able"
9925700,9928180," to monetize some percentage of that audience."
9928180,9932260," So you look at, obviously it's not apples to apples because there are some subscribers"
9932260,9937740," to LTT channel that subscribed 12 years ago and probably haven't looked at the content"
9937740,9938900," in over a decade, right?"
9938900,9944820," So it's, if I say, okay, yeah, we have 15 million subscribers on YouTube and we've only converted"
9944820,9948620," 42,000 of them to Flowplane, you can't look at that ratio and go, oh, well, I'll probably"
9948620,9953740," have a similar level of success, but you also can't ignore that, right?"
9953740,9958260," Out of 15 million, we've converted 42,000."
9958260,9964300," Now that's enough to really move the needle for us these days."
9964300,9969660," But at that ratio, if you had one and a half million, you might have 4,000."
9969660,9975540," If you had half a million, you might have like 1200 subscribers on something like a"
9975540,9978220," patreon or something like a Flowplane."
9978220,9983020," If you had a hundred thousand, you might have, so what's the math here?"
9983020,9984900," Let's go down another fifth."
9984900,9989420," So you'll have like 230 people or whatever that works out to."
9989420,9991300," 230 people at $5 a month."
9991300,9992300," Okay."
9992300,9994100," So maybe you're getting about $1,000 a month."
9994100,9995620," $12,000 a year."
9995620,9999940," If you were planning to live off of that, that's going to be fairly challenging unless"
9999940,10005340," you live in the middle of like butt **** nowhere and you know, you are on a farm where you can"
10005340,10006500," grow your own food or something."
10006500,10007500," Like I don't know."
10007500,10009580," Like yeah, farming content, sure, no problem."
10009580,10012300," Let's go."
10012300,10013780," But the math, right?"
10013780,10019380," Like it's in order for it to actually move the needle, you've got to have a significant"
10019380,10023100," subscriber base."
10023100,10027660," They've gotten really offended when they'll have like a hundred subscribers and they'll"
10027660,10029460," ask about external platform funding."
10029460,10032420," And I'm like, yeah, I don't think it's a good idea right now."
10032420,10035340," And they won't, this won't even be in like relation to Flowplane necessarily."
10035340,10036780," I'm really sure they sort of patreon."
10036780,10038260," I'm like, probably not."
10038260,10040180," And they get pissed and I'm like, no, it's not."
10040180,10042020," I'm not trying to belittle."
10042020,10046300," You have, we've talked about this in a way and show before literally every single action"
10046300,10053620," you ever do has a, that means you're not doing some other form of action."
10053620,10057580," And like, no, you shouldn't just like drown under this thought process forever, but you"
10057580,10063980," should consider like, is it worth my time to start and maintain this other thing when"
10063980,10068500," I am at this stage of my growth as a channel or whatever it is?"
10068500,10073020," No, work on just hard focusing on your main channel."
10073020,10075700," There are inflection points, right?"
10075700,10079900," And to get to a certain size, it might be like, man, this is like working pretty good"
10079900,10083700," or whatever, but like, I could use a bit more cash because if I had a bit more cash, I could"
10083700,10085300," bring on like another editor or something."
10085300,10088380," And by doing that, I could use my time in other ways to do other stuff."
10088380,10090500," It's like, okay, now is the time."
10090500,10091500," It makes sense."
10091500,10096500," Like, yeah, you might hit those certain points where it becomes more or more worth it depending"
10096500,10100500," on what size you're at or how hardcore your audience is."
10100500,10104820," There's channels that will perform extremely well on these types of platforms, whatever"
10104820,10110620," they are because they have niche, heavily invested audiences."
10110620,10111620," Yeah."
10111620,10116620," So even though their channel is like in quotes small, they have a really intense following"
10116620,10119580," that is going to follow them and is going to financially support them."
10119580,10121540," And then, but if you know that, then that's great."
10121540,10125940," So your inflection point might be at a different spot than potentially someone else."
10125940,10132820," You will also see channels that are enormous and just cannot can convert no one."
10132820,10137380," Yeah, because all their followers are not going to put money behind their following no"
10137380,10138380," matter what happens."
10138380,10143700," Or they're located in regions where that kind of disposable income is not feasible."
10143700,10145740," A five dollar month is not going to work."
10145740,10146740," Yeah."
10146740,10147740," And that's fine."
10147740,10149620," But then you should also understand that."
10149620,10153420," Like, maybe it's still not worth it for you, even if you are a really large channel, if"
10153420,10157220," your audience is not going to be able to have that funding power, which is fine, you just"
10157220,10160260," might want to do different things in order to grow."
10160260,10161260," So yeah."
10161260,10162260," That's it."
10162260,10166180," It's not a slight, as long I'm saying."
10166180,10168420," Hi, Linus, and welcome to the Dan show."
10168420,10170660," I noticed you were a fan of Taylor Swift."
10170660,10173980," Are you going for an era's tour concert?"
10173980,10176420," I managed to get tickets on my girlfriend's birthday."
10176420,10177420," She's a big, swiftie."
10177420,10180620," I don't actually do too many concerts."
10180620,10183900," I am super introverted."
10183900,10189620," I know you can't tell because I'm a YouTuber and I have kind of like a bombastic on camera"
10189620,10192940," personality, particularly for the prerecorded stuff."
10192940,10196340," But I don't like dancing in public."
10196340,10202860," I don't like my way of enjoying music is to put in headphones or put on headphones, something"
10202860,10210420," to do with headphones and listen to it myself by myself."
10210420,10217380," Like, honestly, the amount of social interaction that I have to do running a company and having"
10217380,10219740," a family is kind of all my cantaloupe."
10219740,10220740," It's enough."
10220740,10223540," Yeah, it's more than enough."
10223540,10230420," I think it'd be super cool to go to a Taylor Swift concert."
10230420,10234140," But yeah, it's also like, it's a lot of work."
10234140,10236900," Like it takes hours."
10236900,10240860," I had someone, we actually sponsored a small badminton tournament."
10240860,10242660," It was like $1,000 or something like that."
10242660,10244860," Like it wasn't a huge amount or anything."
10244860,10250540," But what was stupid about it was that I had a ton of people notice that we sponsored it"
10250540,10254100," and ask me about it because I know a ton of badminton people locally."
10254100,10255260," And they were like, so you're playing, right?"
10255260,10257500," And I'm like, no, like you sponsored it."
10257500,10260940," I'm like, yeah, but it's like, it's a double knockout tournament."
10260940,10263460," I'm not good enough to win it."
10263460,10266180," It's like an hour for me to drive there."
10266180,10271820," I'm going to play at most two sets or that two matches."
10271820,10275940," So I will play for about, they're probably going to be two sets to complete."
10275940,10280100," So I will play for at most about 30 minutes, 40 minutes."
10280100,10282660," And then I will drive an hour home."
10282660,10284080," It's just, oh, right."
10284080,10285160," And making matters worse."
10285160,10290100," If you lose your first, usually they run the winner bracket first and the consolation"
10290100,10291100," bracket after."
10291100,10292140," I'll see just have to wait."
10292140,10293140," So I'll be waiting."
10293140,10294140," So I'll get there."
10294140,10295140," I'll drive an hour."
10295140,10296140," I'll get there."
10296140,10297500," I'll play for like 30 minutes."
10297500,10299580," I'll get cold, right?"
10299580,10306000," I'll wait for three hours, then I'll play again, cold, and probably lose because I suck."
10306000,10307540," And then I'll drive home for an hour."
10307540,10310740," It's like, I don't know."
10310740,10311740," It's just not worth it."
10311740,10315820," Like I have no problem supporting the event, but I only play waterfall tournaments now because"
10315820,10316820," I just can't."
10316820,10319460," Do you know the waterfall format?"
10319460,10320460," I believe so."
10320460,10321460," Yeah."
10321460,10324860," So it guarantees at least three matches."
10324860,10328540," So also called ABCD flight."
10328540,10331540," And basically what it does is it takes the main draw."
10331540,10340380," And as soon as you lose, you go to, I believe if you lose first, you go to see flight."
10340380,10344420," And then if you lose again, you go to deflight and you compete there in a knockout tournament."
10344420,10348580," And then if you lose, if you win your first, but lose your second, you go to B, I think."
10348580,10353260," And then if you lose again, you go to C. I don't remember how it works, but basically"
10353260,10355020," it's pretty cool."
10355020,10359880," And what it does is it makes it so that by the time you're in the right flight, your"
10359880,10365060," matches should be really close and should be winnable."
10365060,10370180," But it requires an enormous draw to add a ton of participation."
10370180,10375060," It requires way more court time because every player is guaranteed at least three matches."
10375060,10380220," And it requires a huge facility because otherwise you can't run this enormous draw in parallel"
10380220,10382020," and people end up just like waiting around all day."
10382020,10383180," So people don't run them very often."
10384180,10389700," Well, as you've mentioned in a few videos, that it's important to never insult your"
10389700,10390700," fans."
10390700,10393500," So what exactly was the Trust Me Bro shirt then?"
10393500,10395020," It felt very mocking."
10395020,10397100," Love the show otherwise."
10397100,10398340," Thanks."
10398340,10400180," Um, I don't know."
10400180,10407500," I guess from my point of view, I, um, I didn't think too much of the WAN show audience would"
10407500,10409100," be that off put by it."
10409100,10413340," And, you know, maybe I, maybe that was a swing and a miss for me, obviously, right?"
10413340,10419740," Um, you know, I thought that I thought that my track record of taking care of things was"
10419740,10420980," pretty clear."
10420980,10425060," There were some things that I obviously didn't communicate very well."
10425060,10429340," Like when I was talking about like the number, the way that people misinterpreted what I was"
10429340,10434340," talking about with respect to like the warranty liability for like my family, if I passed away"
10434340,10438140," or something like that, I wasn't actually concerned about the warranty liability."
10438140,10442140," What I was concerned about was us coming up with a policy that made sense and was something"
10442140,10446980," that we could follow through on no matter, no matter what and figuring out what mechanisms"
10446980,10447980," we needed in place."
10447980,10449660," So what would that look like?"
10449660,10453740," Well, planning for the worst case scenario, like in the event of my death or something"
10453740,10461660," like that, uh, would that look like some kind of cash of backpacks and screwdrivers held"
10461660,10465180," by a third party in escrow or something like, I don't know."
10465180,10468180," I just didn't know the solutions."
10468180,10473540," Um, you know, as it was, all people wanted was a piece of paper that said this like standard"
10473540,10476700," boilerplate thing and then the whole thing went away and I'm looking at it going, that's"
10476700,10477700," meaningless."
10477700,10478700," You know that, right?"
10478700,10483380," And so yeah, I thought it was kind of funny and they didn't trust me brochure."
10483380,10488700," Like at the end of the day, all it came down to was my word."
10488700,10490140," That was all you have now."
10490140,10491220," That's all you ever had."
10491220,10495380," And that's all you're ever going to have because I'm the director and primary shareholder of"
10495380,10496460," this company."
10496460,10500220," So at the end of the day, if I decided to fold up shop and not honor anything, I could"
10500220,10501500," do that."
10501500,10505260," And so you guys either do trust me or you don't."
10505260,10507500," And it seems like for the most part, you do."
10507500,10508500," Thank you."
10508500,10515900," Um, but yeah, the whole thing in retrospect, I handled it extremely poorly and it just,"
10515900,10518100," it just felt kind of ridiculous to me."
10518100,10523360," The way that it, the way that it blew up when at the end of the day, nothing I ever"
10523360,10526540," said was actually incorrect."
10526540,10528780," It was just upsetting."
10528780,10532620," Um, sorry."
10532620,10538500," That's, that's my Canadian conclusion to the whole saga, I guess."
10538500,10542020," Okay, let's get some more decorated in here."
10542020,10545980," Hello, LLD staying up late to watch you from the European Union."
10545980,10548180," What's your take on user benchmark?"
10548180,10555340," People will sometimes quote me there insanely wrong comparisons and anti AMD propaganda"
10555340,10557940," that they take at face value."
10557940,10566300," Yeah, the lab is basically the lab's job is to make it so that sites like that don't"
10566300,10568260," exist anymore."
10568260,10573540," There's another one that every time I try to compare like some laptop GPU to something"
10573540,10576860," I always end up on this site and it's like worthless."
10576860,10579300," It actually has no useful information whatsoever."
10579300,10582660," I don't care how many stream processors it has, how fast does it go?"
10582660,10588220," And so the lab's goal is going to be to make a database that you can actually trust"
10588220,10593700," database of real data, not just a base."
10593700,10595700," And that was based."
10595700,10596700," Bonkers."
10596700,10599340," Where's my bell?"
10599340,10601140," I've had at least a couple bells today."
10601140,10602540," No, you don't have to do it."
10602540,10604740," So I've been slacking on the bell."
10604740,10605740," Yeah, it's fine."
10605740,10607220," You've replied to a lot of merge messages."
10607220,10608460," Hey Linus, Luke and Dan."
10608460,10616060," Luke, I saw Theo thinking talking about how you're a great developer manager."
10616060,10617060," This is this is possible."
10617060,10618060," Great."
10618060,10619060," Stop, stop crying."
10619060,10620060," Wow."
10620060,10621700," I started my job as a junior crying."
10621700,10625060," I started my job as a junior developer four months ago and I was wondering if you have any"
10625060,10627540," advice for dev starting out."
10627540,10631180," Oh, that's really broad."
10631180,10632180," Wow."
10632180,10633180," I don't know."
10633180,10635180," Wait, he started a job."
10635180,10636180," Is that what he said?"
10636180,10637180," So he has a job."
10637180,10638180," Yeah, they have a job."
10638180,10640820," Yeah, he's been a junior developer for four months."
10640820,10643580," Okay, been working for four months."
10643580,10648140," I would check in with your leadership."
10648140,10654140," Yeah, I would check in with your direct report."
10654140,10660180," And if there's a person above that, that you are able to comfortably talk to about this"
10660180,10661980," stuff, I would check in with them."
10661980,10670340," And just see what they think you could do better in order to advance to not being a junior"
10670340,10671340," anymore."
10671340,10672340," And you've only been a junior for four months."
10672340,10674020," So you're like, probably not that close."
10674020,10678700," So don't expect like, well, it's going to happen right now."
10678700,10684860," But expect maybe some feedback of like basically ask them what it would take in their eyes"
10684860,10688740," for you to advance to the next level, what you would need to be displaying consistently"
10688740,10695540," as a skill or whatever else to be able to get there and work with them to grow internally."
10695540,10697260," That's what I would suggest."
10697260,10698260," Hold on."
10698260,10701400," Tarfif 101 is still not getting the point over in float plane chat."
10701400,10705460," If you got to close the company to not honor the warranty versus just decide not to but"
10705460,10710220," stay open because there's no warranty, then that's not the same one is better."
10710220,10711780," That's not what I said."
10711780,10716740," What I said was we would need systems in place to ensure that whatever we promised would"
10716740,10720020," be honored, even if the company were closed."
10720020,10721980," That's what I said."
10721980,10723540," It was always trust me, bro."
10723540,10725340," It was always we got this."
10725340,10727140," We were always going to got this."
10727140,10730740," We were never trying to get out of anything."
10730740,10738180," I remember that era very precisely because I remember a plan that I had to try to come"
10738180,10743460," up with some kill switch where I could close your chat boxes because I was so tired of"
10743460,10749060," reading chat and just getting in fights with chat for entire streams."
10749060,10752540," There was at least a month there where that was like all that happened."
10752540,10754860," I was like, this is so annoying."
10754860,10758140," You're just getting baited into just everything."
10758140,10764940," But people still, they're still like, I'm not a perfect communicator."
10764940,10766180," I don't claim to be."
10766180,10769100," Maybe maybe maybe maybe, you know what?"
10769100,10770860," Maybe we need to be under new management."
10770860,10772100," Maybe they would do a better job."
10772100,10775980," Maybe they wouldn't be reckless and die and then you wouldn't have to worry about your"
10775980,10779140," warranty."
10779140,10780980," Badman related injury."
10780980,10782820," Yeah, the whole company goes under."
10782820,10783820," Oh, man."
10783820,10788140," I mean, look, you can't just eat an entire loaf of bread like that and then go exercise."
10788140,10790300," You're going to kill over."
10790300,10792540," That's how you get cramps."
10792540,10796740," That's what my stupid doctor said before I fired him."
10796740,10797740," It's raisins."
10797740,10798740," Can't tell."
10798740,10799740," Raisins."
10799740,10800740," Can't tell me what to do."
10800740,10801740," It's fine."
10801740,10803700," I should be back and forth this course."
10803700,10805980," So I want to say that before I get into this."
10805980,10810060," I'm not saying people shouldn't be critical or constructive."
10810060,10814860," But it ties somewhat into the same concept that I brought up a billion times about the"
10814860,10816700," Blizzard press conferences."
10816700,10817700," Yeah."
10817700,10821820," Where like when people scream at the developers on stage because they say something that isn't"
10821820,10827900," PR great, that all that's going to lean into is them not putting devs on stage anymore."
10827900,10828900," Yeah."
10828900,10833900," We would have never had to do any of that stuff because Shadow Slayer puts this really well"
10833900,10839900," historically though, not Linus, denying basically every warranty request is very viable as a scummy"
10839900,10840900," tactic."
10840900,10842660," We wouldn't have to do any."
10842660,10845300," We would just have to just deny warranty requests."
10845300,10846300," It's that simple."
10846300,10848580," And whether you have a written one or not, it doesn't really matter."
10848580,10853420," You could just deny it because pretty much every warranty has legal ease."
10853420,10858660," Cover your butt wording in it that allows you to just deny it at your sole discretion."
10858660,10864180," That's just, that's, that's, that's like no company is going to go under over a warranty"
10864180,10865180," issue."
10865180,10867380," They will try to weasel out of it."
10867380,10872660," Fortunately, we're in a position where our primary business is not making products."
10872660,10877500," Still, our primary business is still creating content."
10877500,10878860," So we wouldn't go under."
10878860,10885500," That's why I said at the time, if every single one of them got returned, it would suck."
10885500,10887620," But it wouldn't kill us."
10887620,10890100," So we actually can afford."
10890100,10893980," Like this is like how I've talked about why the warranty and service situation is so bad"
10893980,10896500," in the tech industry because the margins suck."
10896500,10901020," It's actually not sustainable to offer the kind of service that some other industries"
10901020,10902020," do."
10902020,10907460," Like when you buy a pair of, you know, let's just pick on someone that I consider to be"
10907460,10908460," kind of overpriced."
10908460,10913180," When you buy a pair of Lululemon pants, okay, Lululemon yoga pants, those fricking things"
10913180,10914180," cost."
10914180,10919100," Well, yeah, I expect a no questions asked warranty on this thing because you could have"
10919100,10924180," lit, you could literally give me six of them for what I paid you."
10924180,10928820," By the time you've given me three, you're still laughing all the way to the bank, right?"
10928820,10933780," Like, of course, they don't have that kind of margins in tech."
10933780,10936540," So they tend to behave very, very differently."
10936540,10941100," So we're kind of more like a Lululemon where we don't actually make our money selling you"
10941100,10944860," backpacks, we certainly make money, but that's not how we make our living, I guess, is what"
10944860,10945980," I should have said."
10945980,10950900," So we can afford to take back every backpack if we really needed to."
10950900,10955860," It's a very luxurious position because it allows us to behave in a way that's just not"
10955860,10957300," easy to compete with."
10957300,10960980," The trust me, bro, guarantee is fricking awesome."
10960980,10961980," We got you."
10961980,10966220," I mean, don't be a jerk about it, obviously, but we got you."
10966220,10967220," Yeah."
10967220,10970060," Those customers are poor people or real people and they're nice people and they're cool"
10970060,10972420," people, be nice to them."
10972420,10975220," I am never curating another merch message."
10975220,10976220," Thank you."
10976220,10977220," Thank you."
10977220,10978220," I have learned my lesson."
10978220,10979220," Thank you."
10979220,10980220," We are moving on."
10980220,10981220," Appreciate it."
10981220,10983100," For Linus and Luke, what aspects of your job feel like work and when does it feel like"
10983100,10986140," you are being paid to have fun?"
10986140,10989900," I mean, really, I think the most fun thing for me is talking about the trust me, bro,"
10989900,10990900," warranty."
10990900,10992980," I knew that was going to happen."
10992980,10995580," I was going to slip one into the merch message just to screw with Luke."
10995580,10997860," It's Luke's face that really is the best part."
10997860,10999500," I don't know who I should give it to."
10999500,11001860," Do I upset Luke or do I let Linus upset Luke?"
11001860,11003740," I can never pick."
11003740,11006700," Oh my God."
11006700,11009660," I just like, oh man."
11009660,11011900," At this point, it wasn't even recent."
11011900,11014100," Like, yeah, it's over."
11014100,11016700," Oh, now Luke is doing it."
11016700,11019100," What's fun about your job?"
11019100,11020200," Is it this?"
11020200,11021420," You don't seem to like this."
11021420,11022980," No, I actually really like this."
11022980,11026460," I barely consider Wancho work."
11026460,11030580," The only portion of Wancho that's work is I can't technically do other things because"
11030580,11032660," I do Wancho."
11032660,11033980," But like, I enjoy doing Wancho."
11033980,11035380," I don't want to stop doing Wancho."
11035380,11037020," We've had this conversation before."
11037020,11040900," There have been points in time in the company's history where Wancho was an anchor."
11040900,11041900," Yeah."
11041900,11042900," Like a burden."
11042900,11047540," It was a huge waste of time."
11047540,11049580," These days, not so much, it's doing a lot better."
11049580,11054700," But like, there have been times where we're like, wow, if we look at this logically, we"
11054700,11056900," should really not do this thing anymore."
11056900,11057900," Yeah."
11057900,11060780," And we've kept it going because like, it's just sort of cool."
11060780,11061780," I don't know."
11061780,11066660," I don't think either of us have ever actually understood why people watch it, but we like"
11066660,11067660," hosting it."
11067660,11068660," Yeah, it's fun."
11068660,11071820," I mean, maybe that's why they like watching it."
11071820,11072820," Maybe."
11072820,11077260," Because, okay, I figured it out."
11077260,11078260," I figured it out."
11078260,11079260," What?"
11079260,11084460," Well, neither of us would watch Wancho because we don't have to watch Wancho to hang out."
11084460,11087660," I don't mind hanging out with you for three hours."
11087660,11088660," You?"
11088660,11089660," No problem."
11089660,11090660," Yeah."
11090660,11091660," So that's it."
11091660,11092660," Okay."
11092660,11093860," So it's just like a hangout."
11093860,11094860," Yeah."
11094860,11096940," But we don't, but we can do it anytime we want."
11096940,11099300," We can just jump and discord, but they can't."
11099300,11100300," So they watch Wancho."
11100300,11101300," Fair enough."
11101300,11102300," Okay."
11102300,11103300," Yeah."
11103300,11104300," Okay."
11104300,11105300," I think I finally get it."
11105300,11106540," That makes sense."
11106540,11107540," Nice."
11107540,11108540," Nice."
11108540,11110820," But yeah, I don't know that stuff."
11110820,11115700," But there's a bunch of parts of my job that like, yeah, it obviously feels like a job, but"
11115700,11119780," I enjoy it."
11119780,11125020," I don't enjoy."
11125020,11132100," I enjoy making stuff or like my team making stuff if I want to be more accurate."
11132100,11141900," I don't enjoy when those things have like hugely negative impacts on the company."
11141900,11146980," Like if something that we do like goes down in a really bad way, that sucks."
11146980,11147980," Mm hmm."
11147980,11151820," If it like kind of goes up in flames, but we're still able to hold things together and we"
11151820,11152820," can push there and we make it."
11152820,11153820," Like the roast."
11153820,11154820," Super cool."
11154820,11155820," Yeah."
11155820,11162940," But when things like actually just critical, brutal fail in a way that like wrecks other"
11162940,11169380," people's jobs or days or whatever, that's like a yeah, that kind of blows."
11169380,11172300," But I mean, yeah, I think I think there's a lot of that around here."
11172300,11174580," I think by and large people care about the rest of the team."
11174580,11177820," So it's like, yeah, I don't think anyone wants to waste anybody else's day."
11177820,11178820," Yeah."
11178820,11179820," I think that's pretty normal."
11179820,11180820," Like I don't know."
11180820,11183180," It's a job that there was a bunch of this."
11183180,11184180," Mm hmm."
11184180,11185420," I don't think there's a big deal."
11185420,11189540," There was a there was a decent amount of this in when people talked about like what it's"
11189540,11191140," like working here, right?"
11191140,11197100," They were like, yeah, I think from the outside, sometimes people forget that it's a job."
11197100,11198100," Like it's a job."
11198100,11199100," You have to do job things."
11199100,11200260," Yeah, I actually work."
11200260,11201260," Yeah."
11201260,11206620," Like Reddit post where the person was complaining about like having to work here essentially."
11206620,11207620," Yeah."
11207620,11210260," They're like, I didn't want to work when I showed up to work."
11210260,11212340," And it's like, well, like you have to work really hard."
11212340,11213340," Yeah."
11213340,11214340," Okay."
11214340,11218320," Well, if you can find someone who will pay you to hang out at a social club, then by"
11218320,11219780," helping go do that."
11219780,11220780," Congratulations."
11220780,11221780," I can't compete with that."
11221780,11222780," This ain't it."
11222780,11223780," I got bills to pay."
11223780,11224780," Yeah."
11224780,11228340," This is more like, I don't know, we're more like dogs chasing cars."
11228340,11231540," Like we're, there's stuff to do."
11231540,11232540," Yeah."
11232540,11233540," I don't know."
11233540,11235060," It was always going to be like that."
11235060,11236060," Yeah."
11236060,11239620," Tyback says, I thought you guys weren't supposed to watch those videos."
11239620,11240620," That's me."
11240620,11241620," I can."
11241620,11242620," I'm not allowed to watch."
11242620,11245540," The only promise that I ever made is that I wouldn't watch it and I still haven't."
11245540,11246540," Yeah."
11246540,11247540," I haven't."
11247540,11249580," And I don't think tons of people have said that all the time."
11249580,11250580," That isn't a spoiler."
11250580,11251700," I also didn't say who said it."
11251700,11252700," Like it doesn't matter."
11252700,11253700," Yeah."
11253700,11256900," Well, I never said I wouldn't incidentally come across information about it."
11256900,11259260," I just said that I will not watch it."
11259260,11260340," And he doesn't watch it."
11260340,11262420," I have still haven't watched the first one."
11262420,11267700," I think what I said with the first one is when and if I step out of the company, I'll"
11267700,11268980," watch it then."
11268980,11271460," So I'm going to watch it someday."
11271460,11274980," But not while I'm still working here with the people who were interviewed."
11274980,11276140," I didn't want to."
11276140,11279180," I don't even remember what I should go back and watch."
11279180,11281340," No, I didn't want to influence the process."
11281340,11288060," I wanted to be as light touch as humanly possible on it because I wanted it to be actually"
11288060,11289060," interesting."
11289060,11290060," Yeah."
11290060,11293140," If I'm standing over people, well, they're answering that they're not going to behave"
11293140,11294140," naturally."
11294140,11295140," Right?"
11295140,11298580," I mean, even as it is, like I'm sure you should have pulled their punches a little bit."
11298580,11299580," You should have seen this."
11299580,11300580," I hope not."
11300580,11302060," You can see the stuff Dan said about you, dude."
11302060,11303060," Oh, really?"
11303060,11304500," It was brutal."
11304500,11305780," He just he laid into you."
11305780,11307380," How bad was it, Dan?"
11307380,11309500," It was pretty tight."
11309500,11311900," I never said I wouldn't ask people about it after."
11311900,11312900," I guess."
11312900,11313900," Is that Dan?"
11313900,11316340," You know, I mean, I had to go to the store and everything."
11316340,11317940," You had to go to the store."
11317940,11318940," Yeah."
11318940,11319940," Am I missing something?"
11319940,11320940," I don't know who got the condoms."
11320940,11321940," I feel like I have."
11321940,11322940," What?"
11322940,11323940," What?"
11323940,11324940," What?"
11324940,11328100," It's mostly about the end of my my interview."
11328100,11331980," I bought the cantaloupe for the prison phone video."
11331980,11332980," Oh."
11332980,11333980," Oh."
11333980,11339620," Was that like on your first like I had not been working here long?"
11339620,11342820," Excuse me, Daniel, we need you to go and purchase a cantaloupe."
11342820,11343820," Why is that?"
11343820,11344820," Sure."
11344820,11347420," We're going to stick a phone in it for somebody's butt."
11347420,11348420," Yeah."
11348420,11349420," Already."
11349420,11350420," See you later, Dan."
11350420,11351420," Bye."
11351420,11352420," Um, and you."
11352420,11355900," That was, I had no idea at all what you were talking about."
11355900,11358220," Uh, here's the latest float plane exclusives."
11358220,11359900," We've got Dan front and center on both of them."
11359900,11361700," So if you guys were hoping for more of Dan."
11361700,11366180," We also have a float plane exclusive coming to the win about the WAN show coming to float"
11366180,11367180," plane."
11367180,11368180," Oh, excellent."
11368180,11369180," Yeah."
11369180,11370180," That's, this is the place to get all the behind the scenes."
11370180,11374620," You can get extras from the interviews from what's it like working for LMG."
11374620,11377140," We've got a lot of those full interviews."
11377140,11381420," We've got cutting room floor from the build with my sister in law."
11381420,11382820," This is a cool series there."
11382820,11383820," First time."
11383820,11384820," Yeah."
11384820,11389440," And Colton up so far, it's reacting to their first time on camera."
11389440,11394300," This is just a random behind the scenes compilation featuring, I think, Dan's in it."
11394300,11395300," A bunch of people in it."
11395300,11397060," Take days from the labs in it."
11397060,11399460," Um, yeah, don't miss it."
11399460,11400460," Float plane."
11400460,11401460," Yeah."
11401460,11402460," Yeah."
11402460,11403460," Yeah."
11403460,11404460," Yeah."
11404460,11405460," Hey, any new beta site stuff to talk about?"
11405460,11406460," Uh, we mostly just like fixed stuff this week."
11406460,11407460," That makes sense."
11407460,11408460," Yep."
11408460,11411300," That makes a lot of sense."
11411300,11412300," Cool."
11412300,11414300," But we, we pushed all the things we wanted to push."
11414300,11419300," No, no, no, no, no, no, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not."
11419300,11420780," I'm."
11420780,11421780," But that makes a lot of sense."
11421780,11422780," Yeah."
11422780,11423780," Yeah."
11423780,11427980," Hey Linus, have you tried streaming your PC to your phone over 4G as an alternative to"
11427980,11429840," buying an expensive handheld PC?"
11429840,11434500," I've done it and looks good at five megabits connection, considering how low that is and"
11434500,11436820," the screen size looks good latency sucks."
11436820,11437820," Yeah."
11437820,11441540," And we have a video on that over the, the DIY thing."
11441540,11442540," Yeah."
11442540,11443540," Yeah, the DIY shield."
11443540,11444540," Yeah."
11444540,11446820," Uh, I don't think we did it over cellular data though."
11446820,11447820," I think that was over."
11447820,11448820," Probably not."
11448820,11449820," Probably over Wi-Fi."
11449820,11450820," Over cellular data."
11450820,11454500," I mean, if you're playing a very sight see game, sure, you're not going to be playing"
11454500,11456300," any super meat boy though."
11456300,11458660," You play like vampire survivors or something."
11458660,11459660," You're going to chew boy."
11459660,11462900," You ever going to chew through your data cap though."
11462900,11463900," Wow."
11463900,11464900," Wow."
11464900,11470740," Dear LLD since the thumbnail for today is about chilling."
11470740,11476060," Can we get some more merch options that are just big logos names chilling?"
11476060,11482340," I know you are a fan, but can you just make my, can you just take my money anyway?"
11482340,11484500," Okay."
11484500,11486020," So that's a, wow, you know what?"
11486020,11489420," That actually ties into something we were talking about earlier."
11489420,11494540," The whole thing where I was saying that you have to reach a certain scale before like"
11494540,11499260," a Patreon or a float plane type of monetization makes sense because you'll only be able to"
11499260,11501380," convert a certain percentage."
11501380,11503940," Let's take that and let's apply it another step down."
11503940,11508660," So float plane has a very clear value add where occasionally we'll upload videos early,"
11508660,11511300," particularly before weekends."
11511300,11515820," We've got extra content like clearly if you're into the content, you might be into the extra"
11515820,11518980," content."
11518980,11525060," And it's got from my experience just a much more positive, pleasant community vibe, whether"
11525060,11528780," it's on the live chat during the WAN show or even in the comments under the video."
11528780,11533500," So there's this really clear like value add and it's not just tangentially related."
11533500,11538860," It's directly related to our main product, which is tech videos, right?"
11538860,11539900," So then there's your merch."
11539900,11546700," You're only going to convert a certain percentage of people to your, your physical products."
11546700,11550780," That's also kind of directly related to the main thing because we like build computers"
11550780,11552940," and we have a screwdriver, we carry laptops around."
11552940,11553940," Okay."
11553940,11557860," We've got a backpack, you know, whatever stuff that just has your logo on it that doesn't"
11557860,11563700," necessarily serve a clear function and isn't necessarily directly related to the service"
11563700,11569500," that someone was already enjoying from you is going to be a much lower conversion rate."
11569500,11572780," It's like a conversion rate on a conversion rate."
11572780,11580660," And so if we were to make, I don't know, an LTT or a WAN logo wall ornament or something"
11580660,11585620," like that, first of all, I won't release anything that's crap because I hate that,"
11585620,11586620," right?"
11586620,11591500," We have to be good, which means we have to invest significant development time in it."
11591500,11595540," After we've done that, we have to meet whatever bar there is for a minimum order quantity"
11595540,11602540," from whatever, you know, manufacturer or manufacturer, that we are contracting to produce this product."
11602540,11606180," So let's say a thousand units or 5,000 units."
11606180,11610820," I have no way of knowing exactly what that would be until we've made it significantly"
11610820,11614860," deeply into the development process."
11614860,11619860," At that point, I've got to ask myself, you know, what price do I need to sell this at"
11619860,11624700," now, knowing it's going to be relatively low volume in order for me to make back what"
11624700,11626100," I spent on product development."
11626100,11629820," Okay, because it's going to be low volume, that price is going to have to be higher."
11629820,11639460," Okay, where's the threshold where that high price goes from recouping cost to just like"
11639460,11644340," creating a perception of exploitation and money grubbingness?"
11644340,11649500," Will people see that nuance there where I kind of go, \"Look, this isn't just money grubbing."
11649500,11652860," I actually do need my team to be paid for the development time.\""
11652860,11658420," So am I just hurting my own brand by selling branded stuff that we spent way too much time"
11658420,11661620," working on for a very niche audience?"
11661620,11666100," Maybe."
11666100,11670180," Sometimes I can be really, sometimes I just overthink this stuff though."
11670180,11676660," Like when we did that short-term relaunch of just the classic Linus Tech Tips logo shirt,"
11676660,11679540," it sold like crazy because people just wanted it, I guess."
11679540,11682700," This is actually like legitimately one of my favorite shirts."
11682700,11685340," That's LTX though, that's an event shirt, that's totally different."
11685340,11686700," Yeah, but I'll do an event."
11686700,11690180," One of the big reasons why I like it is just because it's just a little logo in the corner."
11690180,11691740," It feels kind of professional."
11691740,11696660," We have a flag that's going to be there for LTX, like just the LTX logo on a flag for"
11696660,11698660," 2023 here."
11698660,11705060," So I'm more willing to do that for like a commemorative item versus just our brand."
11705060,11706060," Let's go."
11706060,11710540," I don't know, maybe we'll do more of it in the future, maybe not."
11710540,11713100," We have a really cool thing coming though."
11713100,11714940," Tell me something."
11714940,11728380," If you could own a solid aluminum keycap, that is this big."
11728380,11732380," What would you pay for it?"
11732380,11736020," Solid aluminum, chrome plated, what?"
11736020,11737460," It's mirror finish."
11737460,11738460," Does it work?"
11738460,11739460," No, of course not."
11739460,11740460," You can't plug it in."
11740460,11741460," Let's do the questions out."
11741460,11742460," What do you mean?"
11742460,11743460," It's this big, do you don't know how much it fricking weighs?"
11743460,11745140," You can have like a bump."
11745140,11746860," No, you couldn't."
11746860,11748500," Yeah, you could."
11748500,11749700," It's solid aluminum."
11749700,11751100," Yeah, it'd be a bad idea."
11751100,11752100," It would be so much."
11752100,11753100," But you could."
11753100,11755100," There's no mechanism in it."
11755100,11756100," And it's solid."
11756100,11758820," I say solid, I don't mean concave, empty hollowed out."
11758820,11760660," I mean, it is solid."
11760660,11761660," It's a brick."
11761660,11767540," I have no idea at all."
11767540,11768540," I don't know."
11768540,11771420," It doesn't matter what you say because the people out there that want it, they're going"
11771420,11772580," to pay any amount of money."
11772580,11775660," It doesn't matter what you say."
11775660,11777620," Yeah."
11777620,11778620," I don't know."
11778620,11780820," I'm just thinking about the shipping cost."
11780820,11783380," There's some meme about a Loch Ness monster."
11783380,11786820," Give it $4.69 or something."
11786820,11787820," I don't know."
11787820,11788820," I have no idea."
11788820,11789820," No, you give him about $3.50."
11789820,11791980," Yeah, there you go."
11791980,11792980," That's it."
11792980,11793980," You get a double-faced palm."
11793980,11794980," There you go."
11794980,11795980," $3.50."
11795980,11796980," Yeah, there you go."
11796980,11797980," There you go."
11797980,11798980," I want a $3.50."
11798980,11802820," I want a minus to do the quote."
11802820,11803820," Enough."
11803820,11804820," He still didn't."
11804820,11806300," There we go."
11806300,11807540," We got there."
11807540,11808700," Anyway."
11808700,11809700," I have no idea."
11809700,11811060," So we're making this?"
11811060,11812060," Oh, yeah."
11812060,11813060," Wow."
11813060,11815460," That's for meme lines, apparently."
11815460,11816460," Apparently."
11816460,11817460," That's sweet."
11817460,11818980," I don't know, dude."
11818980,11822980," This isn't the type of thing that I buy."
11822980,11825860," If you could have a giant solid aluminum key cap, what would you pay for it?"
11825860,11826860," I'm just curious."
11826860,11828900," I don't think I would buy this."
11828900,11832260," You wouldn't-- okay, if you saw it in a gift shop for $5, you wouldn't be like, okay,"
11832260,11833260," that's pretty cool."
11833260,11834260," Okay, I might buy that."
11834260,11836260," Okay, so it's going to be pretty."
11836260,11837940," Oh, my God."
11837940,11842420," I mean, if it's going to be from Bill of Deluminum and it's about that big, like, it's going"
11842420,11844500," to be closer to $350, then $350."
11844500,11848020," Yeah, that's like $700 in just Bill at Stock."
11848020,11850220," No, no, no, it's not that much."
11850220,11852220," It's big."
11852220,11853220," It's big."
11853220,11854220," It's substantial."
11854220,11857940," You could-- there's going to be three sizes."
11857940,11858940," How big is the big one?"
11858940,11860420," The big one is like this."
11860420,11863540," The medium one's like this and the small one's like this."
11863540,11867500," And the cheapest one."
11867500,11872340," I don't want to quote this wrong, but they're going to be very expensive."
11872340,11878620," Not 700, but all of them are going to be-- I just don't want to say it because I'm going"
11878620,11882340," to get it wrong, but the expensive one's going to be pretty expensive."
11882340,11884700," Yeah, I don't know."
11884700,11891180," This is just one of those things that I have no idea what I was thinking."
11891180,11892180," I don't think you were?"
11892180,11893180," Yeah, I don't know."
11893180,11894180," But it's awesome."
11894180,11896180," I was probably talking to Nicholas Plu for something."
11896180,11897980," Oh, this would be cool."
11897980,11898980," Yeah, yeah."
11898980,11899980," Big key cap."
11899980,11900980," Yeah, I don't know."
11900980,11901980," Big cup."
11901980,11903980," Yeah, I do it, Linus."
11903980,11905660," OK, let's move on."
11905660,11908060," We'll have to send one to Glarcys."
11908060,11909060," Oh, yeah."
11909060,11912140," Yeah, we'll have to do like-- we'll have to engrave."
11912140,11915020," OK, we should probably-- Dan, can you send a note to Nick?"
11915020,11916020," Do you guys ever--"
11916020,11917020," Should send him a custom word?"
11917020,11918020," Working with him?"
11918020,11919300," I want to at some point, but we haven't yet."
11919300,11920300," It just hasn't lined up."
11920300,11921300," Sorry, what's your--"
11921300,11923980," Can you reach out to me like a long time ago about doing that?"
11923980,11924980," Yeah, I know."
11924980,11925980," OK."
11925980,11928620," I just-- I'm busy."
11928620,11929620," I know."
11929620,11931460," How hard is it for you to get on my calendar?"
11931460,11932460," Yeah, fair enough."
11932460,11933700," He's willing to fly out."
11933700,11934700," I know."
11934700,11935700," I know."
11935700,11936700," I know."
11936700,11939460," I just-- it's tough, OK?"
11939460,11940460," Yep."
11940460,11944260," OK, message is sent."
11944260,11947420," I have no idea how to spell any of that."
11947420,11949460," You can figure out what the gibberish means."
11949460,11954500," OK, Luke and Linus, what's a decision that you would initially regret it but in hindsight"
11954500,11957460," turned out to be a great idea?"
11957460,11959020," Hmm."
11959020,11961500," Initially, regretted."
11961500,11971900," Usually, I don't get like instant regret because I usually make pretty OK decisions."
11971900,11975300," Instant regret turned out to be a great idea."
11975300,11980300," Gee, I don't know."
11980300,11986140," There's got to be some kind of-- see, most of the things I regret turn out to be bad ideas."
11986140,11991060," Like buying those stupid Blackmagic 12K cameras, like that was instant regret and a bad idea."
11991060,11994020," Like I turned out to be a great idea though."
11994020,11998100," I saw this one early and have been trying to think about it like this whole time and"
11998100,12000140," I'm in the same spot."
12000140,12004020," Usually I've thought about it enough that once I purchase it, my opinion on it isn't"
12004020,12007100," going to change or I guess it's not just purchases, right?"
12007100,12011540," But like once I do the thing or whatever, my opinion on it isn't really going to change"
12011540,12012540," for probably quite a while."
12012540,12016100," Trying to think if there's anyone I hired that was like, wow, what a decision."
12016100,12017100," Disappointment."
12017100,12019700," But then they've turned out to be great."
12019700,12027220," Now, you took a lot longer to disappoint me."
12027220,12028220," Did I?"
12028220,12029220," I was sleeping on the job immediately."
12029220,12030500," Yeah, but I wasn't disappointed."
12030500,12034500," That was kind of my expectation for what you're being paid."
12034500,12036900," Fair enough."
12036900,12039060," Yeah, yeah."
12039060,12043500," Yeah, I don't know."
12043500,12048500," Yeah, I have to regret it instantly and then it has to turn out to be a great idea."
12048500,12050900," If I regret it instantly, why don't I get a refund?"
12050900,12052060," Like why don't I undo it?"
12052060,12053060," Yeah, yeah, exactly."
12053060,12056740," Yeah, like there's, I can't think of very many things that fit this."
12056740,12059620," Someone said it would be the crowbar hammer for Luke and it's like, well, no, because"
12059620,12061500," it turned out to not be a good idea."
12061500,12063060," So like that doesn't fit this."
12063060,12067500," It's more like a cold feet thing like, but I never regretted, you know, getting engaged,"
12067500,12068500," right?"
12068500,12071060," So if I'd regretted that, then that would have turned out to be a great idea or like having"
12071060,12074580," kids, you know, maybe you instantly regretted it, but it turned out to be a great idea."
12074580,12078340," Like that's the kind of thing we're talking about here, but I didn't instantly regret having"
12078340,12079340," kids."
12079340,12082700," I instantly hated it, but I knew I was going to hate it."
12082700,12083700," I can't stand babies."
12083700,12085740," Definitely things that I dreaded."
12085740,12088740," Like I did it and I was like, this sucks."
12088740,12090180," I don't think this is great."
12090180,12094980," I don't really necessarily have another option, but like I don't like this one."
12094980,12100380," And then in hindsight or down the line or whatever, it's like, actually, that was really good"
12100380,12101380," for sure."
12101380,12102980," But like there was no."
12102980,12106820," I instantly regretted allowing the crowd to decorate my car at LTX."
12106820,12107820," Oh, yeah."
12107820,12109660," That did not turn out to be a great idea."
12109660,12110660," That was just bad."
12110660,12111660," Yeah."
12111660,12116900," Look, in my defense that year, there was a significant lack of activities."
12116900,12117900," Oh, there was."
12117900,12118900," Definitely."
12118900,12119900," And I was trying to save it."
12119900,12120900," Okay."
12120900,12122540," I was sacrificing."
12122540,12125380," Do you remember our miscommunication during that show?"
12125380,12126620," No."
12126620,12130780," You like, it's probably epic though, because I was extremely."
12130780,12132060," You were kind of all over the place."
12132060,12137900," I was extremely upset when I arrived the night before it was starting and realized some of"
12137900,12139420," the things that were going on."
12139420,12143060," And that is not a knock against the team that was working on it."
12143060,12145700," We were understaffed, underfunded."
12145700,12147900," We had kind of no idea what we were doing."
12147900,12151620," It was only our second attempt at this and it was a much bigger space."
12151620,12153740," Just it was no one's fault."
12153740,12157300," But I was like, holy s***."
12157300,12158380," We need to fix this."
12158380,12159380," What can we do?"
12159380,12160380," Yeah."
12160380,12161860," And we'll sacrifice my car."
12161860,12165580," One of the things I thought of was decorate my car booth."
12165580,12168980," And so we put out pens and glue and glitter and googly eyes."
12168980,12171500," It definitely, you know, it was memorable."
12171500,12172500," Kept people busy."
12172500,12173500," Yeah."
12173500,12175180," But that car was actually undriable."
12175180,12178860," People covered the windshield for crying out loud."
12178860,12184660," So you were up in like some bleacher section thing and no one could ever hear you."
12184660,12185660," Do you remember this?"
12185660,12186660," Yes."
12186660,12191060," So if you were in whatever the thing was that you were talking to people in, people could"
12191060,12192060," hear you."
12192060,12194300," Oh, like the little, yeah, there was a little like stage area."
12194300,12195300," Remember what it was."
12195300,12196300," Yeah."
12196300,12197300," Yeah."
12197300,12198300," And so bleachers around it."
12198300,12200980," If you were specifically in like those bleachers or that area, whatever, you could hear Linus."
12200980,12203900," But if you were outside of it, it didn't matter if he was like leaning over the edge"
12203900,12206620," and yelling at you, you could not hear him at all."
12206620,12208620," Just how the acoustics of the area worked or whatever."
12208620,12209940," You had got a really high ceiling."
12209940,12214580," So like this and this, I think like cancel each other out effectively."
12214580,12215580," Yeah."
12215580,12216580," Sound bouncing."
12216580,12217580," It was pretty wild."
12217580,12218580," Yeah."
12218580,12226740," So someone gave me these like sharpies or something and they were very unsure about why they"
12226740,12229020," were giving them to me."
12229020,12233700," But they made it very clear that there was not very many of these and like I should be"
12233700,12235860," very careful with them."
12235860,12238580," And I was like, okay, this is really weird."
12238580,12240820," I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do with these."
12240820,12243740," And then you like yelled something over the thing."
12243740,12246940," And I thought you said like keep them away from people or something."
12246940,12248980," I don't remember exactly what I thought you said."
12248980,12254540," But I thought you were like, this is like a, you can't like let the random attendees get"
12254540,12255740," your sharpie."
12255740,12258700," And like if someone gets your sharpie, they like get something or something."
12258700,12264540," So I was like, oh, so I have to like run away with these, which is not at all what he"
12264540,12265540," said."
12265540,12270180," I thought it was what he said, so I just started running around."
12270180,12272460," It was more of like a collect the Pokemon thing."
12272460,12276380," People were supposed to try to get signatures and all the colors or something like that."
12276380,12279060," What I thought was going on was they were supposed to collect the sharpies."
12279060,12281820," I remember being like, this is really stupid, but okay."
12281820,12282820," Yeah."
12282820,12285300," And it makes sense because that wasn't what was going on."
12285300,12288180," But yeah, communication during that event was a huge problem."
12288180,12289180," Yeah."
12289180,12290180," So we can do better."
12290180,12291180," We have done better."
12291180,12293140," It's been four years since we did better."
12293140,12295060," Hopefully we remember how to do better."
12295060,12297900," Hopefully we're not just like, yeah, I forget how to do this."
12297900,12298900," Let's start from scratch."
12298900,12300580," Now they assure me it's going to be really good."
12300580,12301580," I think I'll be good."
12301580,12304380," I've been less involved in the lead up to it though."
12304380,12309100," So I don't actually know that, but I do trust the team that's working on it."
12309100,12312180," If it was as good as last time, would you be happy?"
12312180,12314980," Honestly, yeah."
12314980,12319220," If you'd asked me that right after LTX 19, I'd have said no."
12319220,12321300," I expect it to be bigger and better."
12321300,12327060," But given the momentum that we lost in four years, if it's on par, then we'll come back"
12327060,12330220," stronger 2024 and we can set our sights on that."
12330220,12331220," Yeah."
12331220,12332220," Yeah."
12332220,12333220," It makes sense."
12333220,12334220," Okay."
12334220,12338100," We're nearing the end of the time here, but we've had a lot more to get through."
12338100,12342700," Companies are currently not liable for abandoning software support for physical items."
12342700,12343700," Oh, God."
12343700,12344700," Sorry."
12344700,12345980," I just want to I want to interject something."
12345980,12349260," I wasn't the only person that misinterpreted that way."
12349260,12353420," While you were talking, random fans started trying to grab the Sharpies from my hands."
12353420,12355100," And then I remember being mad at you at the end."
12355100,12356500," I was like, why did you give away the Sharpies?"
12356500,12358180," We don't have more of those."
12358180,12361220," Like if we want to continue to have people collect the thing."
12361220,12362220," Yeah."
12362220,12363220," Yeah."
12363220,12367660," I was like, and I had red marks all up and down my arms because people were like clawing"
12367660,12369220," at me trying to get them and stuff."
12369220,12371380," It was it was quite the racket."
12371380,12372380," Sorry, keep going."
12372380,12373380," Oh, that's okay."
12373380,12374460," We'll broadcast it."
12374460,12378380," Companies are currently not liable for abandoning software support for physical items."
12378380,12383180," Would you support legislation requiring manufacturers to state their best supported until date on"
12383180,12384180," products?"
12384180,12390780," No, what I really want is for them to have to hand it over to some other steward if they're"
12390780,12392180," not going to support it anymore."
12392180,12393620," That just needs to be how it works."
12393620,12395260," I don't think that's ever going to happen."
12395260,12401660," So I guess this would be a I guess this would be something, but I just don't want stuff"
12401660,12403700," to end up e-waste if it's still working."
12403700,12407380," That should be unacceptable to everyone involved."
12407380,12412380," As you've dabbled in making tools like screwdrivers, have you considered making tools for firefighters"
12412380,12413380," or paramedics?"
12413380,12416780," I carry a screwdriver in my bunker gear pockets and I love it."
12416780,12418380," Larger tools are common."
12418380,12421020," Yeah, we'd consider making other tools."
12421020,12427820," We have a hundred thousand shafts from the original manufacturer for the screwdriver that"
12427820,12431380," don't meet our screwdriver shaft quality standards."
12431380,12434340," So they are effectively garbage metal tubes."
12434340,12437780," We have 100,000 of them."
12437780,12441580," So we are trying to frame some ends for them."
12441580,12445020," Without consulting me, they asked for them to be shipped to us."
12445020,12448820," So I paid freight over the ocean for a hundred thousand metal shafts."
12448820,12449900," It's less than you would think."
12449900,12451100," They weren't air-shipped or anything."
12451100,12452860," They came on a boat."
12452860,12455300," Yeah, very slow boat."
12455300,12458740," And we've got some ideas."
12458740,12463220," The idea that I pitched first was we make something called a fail wrench."
12463220,12469980," So if you can dodge a hundred thousand dollar loss, then you can dodge a fail wrench."
12469980,12474780," So we just melt them and just make a stupid, crappy adjustable wrench."
12474780,12476980," And the team was like, \"No, we can't do that."
12476980,12478780," It'll take forever to make it to your standard.\""
12478780,12479980," I'm like, \"Not to fail wrench.\""
12479980,12481780," It doesn't have to be to my standards."
12481780,12485260," So the trash is making it like a bonus bin."
12485260,12489340," Buy a shirt, get a wrench."
12489340,12490340," Not free shipping."
12490340,12494700," Oh, a shirt weighs 200 grams, wrench weighs five pounds."
12494700,12495940," One of the ideas we're working on."
12495940,12497500," That's a big wrench."
12497500,12500980," One of the ideas we're working on now is turning them into a fail pen."
12500980,12504420," So do we like a bolt action style thing?"
12504420,12506260," We'd have to get the ergonomics right, though."
12506260,12511180," And one of the reasons that they're not deemed acceptable is that the knurling kind of sucks."
12511180,12513580," But what sucks about it is that it's not deep enough."
12513580,12516460," So it might actually be okay for a pen."
12516460,12521900," Yeah, there's some other ideas for things we could melt them down into."
12521900,12525140," But I don't remember what the question was."
12525140,12526500," Oh, yeah, we thought of making more tools."
12526500,12528220," Yeah, we're going to make more tools."
12528220,12532500," I give you my guarantee, but we're probably going to be mostly focused on tech tools just"
12532500,12534620," because that's where the bulk of our audience is."
12534620,12535620," Yeah."
12535620,12539260," Linus, you mentioned you don't buy games day one, but did you pick up tiers of the kingdom?"
12539260,12540980," And will you be playing it this weekend?"
12540980,12544540," Side note, Luke needs to play Breath of the Wild already."
12544540,12547100," I don't think he does."
12547100,12548100," You don't think I do?"
12548100,12551060," I mean, unless you really like to."
12551060,12552060," I had fun with it."
12552060,12553500," It was just it was a playing game."
12553500,12555420," So I know what I'm going to play it next."
12555420,12560180," I know exactly what I'm going to play it is because I'm going on a plane soon."
12560180,12561780," It's not in my bag, but I do have it."
12561780,12562780," I thought so."
12562780,12563780," Yeah."
12563780,12565580," But I'm not going to play it on my Switch."
12565580,12572700," My copy that I bought is just because I know I'm going to pirate it."
12572700,12576180," I don't want my save data on a Switch."
12576180,12577180," That's not unreasonable."
12577180,12581300," And I'm not paying for Nintendo online forever just to be able to back up my save game."
12581300,12582700," That's ridiculous."
12582700,12583700," I don't accept it."
12583700,12584700," I'm sorry."
12584700,12588420," I consider this to be ethical piracy."
12588420,12593460," So yeah, I've already downloaded it, but I haven't actually like applied all the patches"
12593460,12596100," and 60 FPS mod and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
12596100,12598620," So I'm going to I'm going to play it on the RGL."
12598620,12599620," Yeah."
12599620,12603900," Yeah, breath of the wild runs really good on the ally."
12603900,12604900," That's pretty sweet."
12604900,12608660," And I'm expecting because it's designed for the same hardware and breath of the wild was"
12608660,12611620," already at the limits of what it could do that tears of the kingdom probably isn't going"
12611620,12613860," to be much more demanding than breath of the wild."
12613860,12617380," And what's great about all of this is I can take that same save game and I can play it"
12617380,12622220," on my projector off of my PC or I can play it on the ally or I can play it wherever and"
12622220,12623700," I can keep my save game."
12623700,12625620," It's going to be awesome."
12625620,12629180," I won't get to keep my horses though, but I don't really care because it's been like three"
12629180,12632020," years since I've touched breath of the wild three or four."
12632020,12634260," So I don't even remember my horse's name or what it looks like."
12634260,12639220," So makes no difference to me."
12639220,12640420," Shout out to the newly weds."
12640420,12647020," I and R.C. his best man named dropped LTT store.com during his speed."
12647020,12649380," And I just had to share the moment."
12649380,12650380," Happy Friday."
12650380,12651380," Heck yeah."
12651380,12652380," Thanks for letting us know."
12652380,12653380," Nice."
12653380,12658540," I don't think I have seen weekly float plane exclusives on LMG clips in a while."
12658540,12659540," What happened to it?"
12659540,12660540," Is that over?"
12660540,12662020," Did not attract people to float plane?"
12662020,12665260," Oh, it's not over, but it was never intended to be weekly."
12665260,12670300," It was going to be sometimes we'll try it and see how it works as a promotional mechanism"
12670300,12672020," and it works great."
12672020,12673980," Okay."
12673980,12677340," And we are now done with our curated."
12677340,12679100," So let's go through some of these potentials."
12679100,12680500," Rapid fire if you can."
12680500,12681500," Would LTT be willing to release?"
12681500,12682860," Would you like to go home or something?"
12682860,12683860," No."
12683860,12686460," I want you to be protected from the ire of a Vaughn."
12686460,12687460," What?"
12687460,12688460," Do you want to go home?"
12688460,12690180," We've had this discussion line us."
12690180,12692340," I will stay here till Monday."
12692340,12694060," Only Monday?"
12694060,12696060," What are you weak?"
12696060,12698700," No, I have stuff to do for Luke on Monday."
12698700,12699700," That's true."
12699700,12700700," I have to go to the other building."
12700700,12701700," But Luke over here."
12701700,12702700," Yep."
12702700,12703700," Other building."
12703700,12705700," No, but Blancheau is here so you'll be here."
12705700,12706700," Ah, I'm just true."
12706700,12708780," I mean, if we're still doing Wanchau, then it's fine."
12708780,12709780," Yeah."
12709780,12714940," I got enough monitors for the both of us."
12714940,12716380," What was the question?"
12716380,12717380," I don't know."
12717380,12721620," What did LTT be willing to release?"
12721620,12726540," The STL file for stick locks to the community so we can print our own out of TPU."
12726540,12732460," Support those gamers who cannot afford to pay for them."
12732460,12734900," Probably not, unfortunately, for this one."
12734900,12741860," I'm afraid that the individual people printing them are not the concern."
12741860,12747500," They could easily enough probably reverse engineer it and kind of figure it out."
12747500,12752180," But if we give the exact files to an overseas manufacturer, inevitably they're going to"
12752180,12753180," be cloned anyway."
12753180,12755900," I get that, but I'm not going to go out of my way to make it easier."
12755900,12758580," I guess is what I'm trying to say."
12758580,12760860," Hi, DLL."
12760860,12766020," Actually, Nick Light has told me I should be pronouncing this Dale."
12766020,12767740," Hi, Dale."
12767740,12770620," Questions for Linus about the Sony A95K TV?"
12770620,12777260," Have you run in a blue tint problem due to fingerprints and has been unable to clean"
12777260,12778260," them?"
12778260,12779260," Sorry, let me parse this again."
12779260,12783180," Have you run into the issue with blue tint due to fingerprints and not being able to"
12783180,12784180," clean them?"
12784180,12788340," Tons of people have had this issue and zero acknowledgment from Sony."
12788340,12791140," I can't say I have because I'm not a caveman."
12791140,12792940," I don't touch my TV screen."
12792940,12796820," I understand that a lot of people have kids, so it might not actually be avoidable."
12796820,12798220," I was being facetious."
12798220,12802700," But no, I haven't run into it because there are no fingerprints on my TV."
12802700,12809340," So it's possible that it is an issue, but it's not one that I've encountered."
12809340,12810660," Really excited for the stick locks."
12810660,12811820," Thanks for making them."
12811820,12815860," Linus, you've talked about your love for final fantasy tactics in the past."
12815860,12818620," What's your favorite class and team style?"
12818620,12820100," Oh, man."
12820100,12823500," I'm not even aware of team styles."
12823500,12831580," I like kind of tanky casters."
12831580,12837420," Oh, OK, if I had a team style, I guess I'm a big move plus two."
12837420,12842420," I will waste so much time with my guys."
12842420,12843420," Oh, man."
12843420,12844420," What's the class?"
12844420,12847700," I haven't played it in a while."
12847700,12850220," Move plus two tactics."
12850220,12853220," Let's see."
12853220,12854700," What the heck is blink blade?"
12854700,12860420," OK, I have no idea what's even going on."
12860420,12861420," Final fantasy tactics."
12861420,12862420," Here we go."
12862420,12863420," Move step."
12863420,12864420," Man, why is it so hard to find?"
12864420,12867020," OK, I'm sure someone's telling me the thing."
12867020,12872020," But I will basically take every one of my party members and make sure they have move"
12872020,12876860," plus two."
12876860,12877860," Come on, guys."
12877860,12878860," Help me out here."
12878860,12879860," Nope."
12879860,12880860," Nothing yet."
12880860,12881860," I don't know."
12881860,12883860," I have no idea."
12883860,12885980," I'm just trying to think."
12885980,12889020," Like, what are-- I use a lot of the special characters."
12889020,12895700," I always love Agrias, Agrias, whatever her name is."
12895700,12899420," I hate anything that's kind of like probability-based."
12899420,12906780," So, you know, I know you can build like just super OP, like ninjas and stuff like that"
12906780,12909180," because they have like crazy high evade."
12909180,12914340," But I would rather have super high defense and have like a predictable amount of damage"
12914340,12916140," than super high evade."
12916140,12922700," And sometimes I dodge and sometimes I get absolutely bone crushed."
12922700,12925340," I don't like too much randomness."
12925340,12926940," Apparently move plus two is thief."
12926940,12931580," Yeah, thief sucks so much in Final Fantasy Tactics."
12931580,12937460," But I will make everyone grind like a thousand job points in thief to get move plus two because"
12937460,12943220," when you are mobile like that, you are unstoppable."
12943220,12944900," Because otherwise you get screwed."
12944900,12949300," Like I think the default move stat is like two or three rather."
12949300,12953460," And then some classes are more and then you can add move plus two."
12953460,12954660," So you can move like six."
12954660,12955660," Oh, no, there's items."
12955660,12956660," That's right."
12956660,12957660," There's items you can equip for like move plus one."
12957660,12961620," So you can put on boots and then add move plus two and then you can go six."
12961620,12967140," So you can basically go in, hit, retreat, and human characters that are fighting with"
12967140,12969140," you will not be able to catch up easily."
12969140,12973460," But monsters are super mobile and it can be a real problem because you can't get away"
12973460,12974460," from them."
12974460,12977060," They just close the distance so fast."
12977060,12980060," Anyway, hey Dale."
12980060,12981860," Oh, no, they're moving."
12981860,12983180," Well, I'll try this one."
12983180,12984180," Hey there."
12984180,12988260," I've taken a liking to boxers with man pouches."
12988260,12992140," They feel comfy for my important parts during hot days at home."
12992140,13001100," Do you think LTT will one day offer boxers with man man pouches?"
13001100,13008260," Well, congratulations."
13008260,13012940," I honestly was reading that whole time."
13012940,13017020," All I got from what you said was man pouches and then he just said congratulations."
13017020,13018460," So whatever happened was funny."
13018460,13021180," I almost had mouches at the last one."
13021180,13022180," Fumble that."
13022180,13023980," I don't know."
13023980,13028740," We get a lot of really great feedback on the comfort of the boxers boxer briefs as they"
13028740,13029740," are."
13029740,13035980," I think we're more likely to do more styles and less likely to do new new bodies for them."
13035980,13036980," Ergonomics."
13036980,13038980," Yeah, for the time being."
13038980,13041620," I have a three."
13041620,13042620," Let's see."
13042620,13044580," Yeah, this is kind of in the same 3D printer."
13044580,13045580," Raylum."
13045580,13049020," I have a 3D printer and would love to make use of it with all the products you're rolling"
13049020,13050020," out."
13050020,13054460," Would you consider a line of 3D downloadable models relating to electronics or cable management?"
13054460,13057620," No, I don't think so."
13057620,13060420," It's just one of those things where I think there's stuff that we've released in the"
13060420,13061620," past or something."
13061620,13065460," I think our CPU holders are out there but we're not going to charge for that."
13065460,13069620," Like if it's something that you can 3D print then why don't you just 3D print it."
13069620,13072540," And there's a huge community out there that's designing 3D printable stuff."
13072540,13074540," Like go do your thing."
13074540,13078980," The reason that you should buy stick locks instead of just 3D printing them is because"
13078980,13083020," 3D printing is not the be all and end all of manufacturing."
13083020,13090620," And in this case these are, I forget if they're pressure mold or there's two different ways"
13090620,13093380," that you can do injection molding for a part like this."
13093380,13095020," And we did one of them."
13095020,13096020," I can't remember which."
13096020,13100820," And the reason was that it gets the composition just right."
13100820,13103020," Allows you to customize the material."
13103020,13106380," There's a whole bunch of, there's a whole science, you know, to materials."
13106380,13108220," It's called material science."
13108220,13109220," Oh wow."
13109220,13110900," Yeah, I know right."
13110900,13114900," So for us, you know, the products that we make and sell are going to be ones that do"
13114900,13121140," require more complex manufacturing at least, you know, at scale, right?"
13121140,13124220," And if you guys want to like make your own thing and 3D print them, then yeah, you should."
13124220,13125220," That's awesome."
13125220,13127380," It's freaking amazing."
13127380,13128700," But it's a different thing."
13128700,13131220," And I don't think we would like sell that."
13131220,13132740," Hi Dale."
13132740,13137180," I love my new LTT backpack compliments to Sarah and everyone in the creator warehouse."
13137180,13138180," Great job."
13138180,13143180," So the LTT backpack hold the upcoming framework 16."
13143180,13148100," Um, yeah, yeah, it should be fine."
13148100,13150020," I'd have to double check for sure."
13150020,13151020," But it should be fine."
13151020,13154620," Compression molded says Tynan, who is apparently watching when show right now."
13154620,13157660," Yes, these are compression molded, not injection molded."
13157660,13158660," Thank you, Tynan."
13158660,13160300," Hi, DLL."
13160300,13164420," I noticed in Linus Media Group.com the team doesn't show Luke there."
13164420,13168580," Is that because he is full of plane or has his change in role mean he is still separate"
13168580,13170020," from the main company?"
13170020,13172740," Also, I'm not reading the rest of that."
13172740,13173740," Yeah, continue."
13173740,13175460," So just laziness, I think."
13175460,13176460," Yeah."
13176460,13178340," Originally, that was the reason."
13178340,13182420," But then creator warehouse became a thing and people that work under creator warehouse"
13182420,13184380," are on there."
13184380,13189940," So like a bunch of years after that happened, someone pointed that out because I've never"
13189940,13193140," really cared to be honest."
13193140,13196300," And we were like, oh, well, we'll fix that eventually."
13196300,13199300," And we will fix that eventually."
13199300,13202060," People keep on offering to take headshots of just me."
13202060,13206460," But my current thing is like, well, if I'm going on, all my people should probably go"
13206460,13207460," on."
13207460,13211380," So what will probably happen is, um, at one of the events, like either Christmas party"
13211380,13215540," or LTX or something, when all of the remotes kind of come in, I will probably do a bunch"
13215540,13219180," of headshots and then do them all at the same time so that we all go up together or something"
13219180,13220180," like that."
13220180,13221180," I don't know."
13221180,13222180," But yeah."
13222180,13228620," Hey, DLL love the content had been following since about 2011 out of curiosity."
13228620,13234380," How many of the float plane users still have the OG $3 tier?"
13234380,13235820," I could figure this out."
13235820,13239620," I don't know the number off top of my head, but it's like quite a few."
13239620,13243020," A lot of people that subscribe back then are just still here."
13243020,13245020," It's pretty cool."
13245020,13246020," It's sick."
13246020,13247020," Yeah."
13247020,13249020," And I think the last one we have for tonight."
13249020,13250540," Hello future me."
13250540,13255540," Interesting things have you experienced when supplying or acquiring different products?"
13255540,13257500," Restock of pajama pants went."
13257500,13262420," I don't know about the restock, but, um, I mean, here was an interesting thing."
13262420,13269020," Our T-shirts for LTX are initial sample that I approved and the top of production sample"
13269020,13270580," that we got."
13270580,13271580," Very different materials."
13271580,13272900," Oh, yeah."
13272900,13276540," So we think a supplier might have switched subcontractors on us."
13276540,13280260," So we are deeply worried about LTX T-shirts."
13280260,13285620," They're either going to be less comfortable than we expected."
13285620,13289500," To be clear, they're not awful, but they're not up to our usual shirt standard."
13289500,13292860," And part of that is because we couldn't just use our regular blanks because they're tie"
13292860,13296980," dye and, uh, you can't have synthetic materials."
13296980,13297980," It's got to be cotton."
13297980,13298980," Got it."
13298980,13303500," So they're either going to be less comfortable than our usual standard or they will not exist"
13303500,13306300," at this point because I don't know if you noticed, but we're getting pretty close."
13306300,13307500," Yeah, it's not that far away."
13307500,13308500," Yeah."
13308500,13310220," So I'm, um, very unhappy there."
13310220,13315100," That's the most recent me very unhappy big surprise merch moment."
13315100,13319540," I think that's it."
13319540,13321380," Hey, we'll see you again next week."
13321380,13322380," Same bad time."
13322380,13323380," Same bad channel."
13323380,13324220," Bye."
13324220,13333020," Bye."
13333020,13350700," Bye."
13350700,13353280," (upbeat music)"
