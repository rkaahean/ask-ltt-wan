0,8880," What is up everybody? Happy Friday and welcome to the Wenshow. We have way too many topics."
8880,14800," This is a serious problem. What happened? Switch monitor Gary Bowser has been released"
14800,24320," from prison with a life destroying fine. Meanwhile, game devs have been cracking down on hardware"
24320,28480," level cheats. This is going to be a really interesting conversation. What else we got today?"
28480,36080," Seagate was hit with a $300 million fine for violating an export ban. And where is it?"
36080,40880," Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Gameplay trailer accused of being filmed?"
40880,49280," IRL. It was that convincing. Okay. Everyone was fooled. That. Everyone."
50000,59280," That's the title tie in today. Everyone? Really Luke? Everyone? Let's just roll the intro."
59280,65920," We'll talk about that later."
65920,86800," The show is brought to you today by Vessi Zoho One and Squarespace. Obviously,"
86800,91200," we're going to have to jump right into our headline topic, which is the gameplay trailer"
91200,97280," that fooled the world. Are we showing it? Are we just going to talk about it? We might as well"
97280,102000," show it. I mean, what's IGN going to do? Copyright strike us. Oh, we could have just brought it up"
102000,106880," from the creators. Okay. That's fine. You guys are going to want to go check it out on your own"
106880,112400," screens because you're watching this through our compression. Now, there are some things that are"
112400,118400," very, very convincing about this. In fact, I think the approach of the building is probably"
118400,124480," the most hyper realistic looking part of this gameplay trailer. The fact that this gets blown"
124480,131760," out as the camera's apparent automatic exposure adjusts to the darker environment here on the"
131760,145040," protagonists left. But this flashlight. Come on. Come on. It looks like a video game flashlight."
145040,150400," And okay, to be clear, to be clear. Okay, I'll bring it back up. I'll bring it back up in a second."
150400,156480," I am not hating on the people that were initially bamboozled here. Okay, right. Yeah, yeah, yeah."
156480,163280," But when the game developer came out and said, no, this is in engine. This is rendered on just"
163280,171920," a gaming computer. This is just the game being played. And people are like, no, I don't believe you."
173680,176800," And they, and they, they actually can't tell at that point. I mean,"
176800,184640," really? Really? Okay, so we'll go back. Let's go back. Let's go back to the game. So I want to"
184640,191920," talk about this flashlight. Okay, the way that it illuminates things. That is not how a flashlight"
191920,198480," works. The light bouncing is not true to life at all."
200800,205520," I think it's pretty good. I think it's better than most games. No, okay, no question."
205520,212480," No question. No question. But even after. So what happened is this gameplay trailer was released."
212480,218800," People said basically went, it looks like you're cheating. It looks like you just record a body"
218800,222800," cam footage and you're trying to pass it off as a game trailer. You're trying to pull some kind of"
222800,230640," scam, right? And he comes out and he goes, actually, no. And he posts a no clip version of it."
230880,236320," Where he's flying around. You can, you can technically fake a lot of what happened in that no clip"
236320,244640," version. You can technically fake anything. I agree with Linus, actually, but I'm just, I'm throwing"
244640,248880," some counterpoints to try to make it more interesting. You can technically fake a lot of what happened"
248880,257200," in the, in the no clip. Sir, you can fake a battle with a sea dragon in Shang-Chi. That doesn't mean"
257200,262880," that what he did is not perfectly valid evidence. I completely. Oh, okay. Hold on. I actually have"
262880,265840," a bit of a counterpoint. Okay. Let's bring up the no clip. Let's bring up the no clip. Okay."
265840,272480," Unrecord, unrecord. Actually, I have it on my screen full screen. You've got it. Okay. I'm coming"
272480,276800," over to you. Go for it. So I'm going to go back to the beginning. Okay. This is it. So here he is,"
276800,284240," in the environment, showing the way the auto exposure quote unquote handles things. And then he goes,"
285360,290480," also, that is not the angle at which arms come out of an actual body. So no."
290480,303520," Here we go. Those reflections in the water look great. Jump cut slightly. And I want to make it"
303520,311040," really clear. I am not saying that this is an ugly looking game or that this, this hyper,"
311040,318640," hyper realism appearance that it has is not hyper realistic. It's hyper realistic. It's amazing."
318640,322880," It just looped. This is back to the beginning. Okay. So, okay. So some of my arguments, there are"
322880,332320," sure easily things that this developer could have done to make the no clip proof significantly more"
332320,338880," obvious as actual real proof. We went through walls. That's not actually that hard to think at all."
340800,348800," I think that they did it this much so that there's just the slightest bit of doubt in some people"
348800,354400," because that is getting us to talk about it. I think this was tactical. That's fair enough,"
354400,360560," which is fair enough. However, I think the, I think the developer is very smart and did this"
360560,367040," entirely on purpose. Personally, I did not need the no clip because there are some fairly obvious"
367040,371920," tells. And I mean, maybe part of this and the people after the no clip basically saying,"
371920,378080," I still don't believe you. La la la la. I don't know. I don't know what to tell you guys because"
378080,383120," and maybe part of this is that I do this for a living. Like I pixel peep and evaluate the"
383120,388560," graphical fidelity of things and look at new rendering features and their implementations."
388560,394800," I actually do this for a living. But to me, there's some things to stand out. If you sent this to me"
394800,401920," and said, okay, what is this? What is this bokeh effect here? Obvious post-processing."
401920,408560," That is not real bokeh. I think another thing that really, really benefits all the footage is"
408560,415840," because it's trying to recreate this effect of like shakey, chanky body cam. Yes. It does a bunch"
415840,422240," of stuff like this where it actually it looked, it looked, it's intentionally lowering its quality."
422240,425040," Sure. Well, having really, really high quality assets."
425040,432240," So that makes it so much more believable is these like actually really rough like kind of bad"
432240,437760," screen effects that they have going on make it so much more believable. It's a very interesting"
437760,443680," effect. The way that they handled the motion. Yeah. Okay. The way that they handled the perspective"
443680,450560," and the camera shaking. So cool. I also think. So cool. That this is, you know, like piloted by"
450560,457360," expert. So I have some theories that just like in Tarkov, there's independent head control. So"
457360,461600," Tarkov, if you hold down your middle mouse button, it doesn't matter where your firearm is located,"
461600,468560," you can look around like this with your head. And I think that's going on in here. And the"
468560,473040," developer, whoever has just ran through the scenario a bunch of times. So they did it at really"
473040,480400," realism effective times, if you know what I mean. Sure. So when there's already that thing where"
480400,486560," you can kind of move where you're aiming and the perspective of the like head of the person that"
486560,490400," you're controlling doesn't immediately move. So you have the firearm slightly disconnect. And that's"
490400,495600," something most people wouldn't be used to and wouldn't imagine that a game would be capable of."
495600,499760," Mostly like counter strike valorant, something that they don't do that. It's fixed. There are"
499760,504800," games that do this already. Yeah. This one's implementation is extremely good. And look at that."
504800,510800," I think it's doubling up with some independent head control. Yeah. And a player who is extremely"
510800,516160," adept at making this feel real. Sure. Like I think this is almost acted, I would say. You know what I"
516160,519680," mean? Sure. Yeah, I could see that. I mean, it's a trailer. Yeah, they went through trying to make"
519680,524160," it feel like it was real, which is what they should have done for the trailer. But yeah, I think it's"
524160,534080," I think it's again, we've got messy post processing here. The smoke. Yeah. The smoke is"
534080,539360," absolutely video game smoke is wild. Yeah. The angle of the arms is also wrong again."
539360,544800," And it's not it's not like to be clear. It's not bad smoke for a video game. It's just also"
544800,547120," it's video game smoke. Yeah."
547120,557280," The way that this darkness that he's standing in here is so dark. That's not correct. Like black."
557280,563280," With with daylight coming in here, this would be blown out. But this would have a lot more light."
563280,571360," And again, okay, I'm like, I was actually kind of arguing with Riley about this before the show"
571360,578560," because I said something along the lines of where's my where's my chat with Riley."
578560,584560," I was like really great while you're looking at a really great area scans of where this is."
584560,588880," I was like, it's obvious. It's not real. What if these people never seen a game before must be"
588880,594960," console gamers. Modern crisis can look almost this good. And he's like, I was I was kind of"
594960,599520," trolling. That's because I knew that doing a little for thought. Yeah, I was I was obviously"
599520,605440," messing with him a little bit. But he's like, bro, me and apparently 75 of the internet were like,"
605440,612320," whoa, upon seeing it. It's definitely a whoa. It's it's pretty crazy. I was talking to to"
612320,615840," Jaden about this because he's he's really into game engines and understands a lot of their"
615840,620640," limitations and stuff like that. We've had conversations in the past about different game"
620640,624880," engines. I'll like comment about how some game looks good and he'll be like, no, yeah,"
624880,630000," it doesn't because of these reasons that I'm like, oh, and it's a whoa. But another thing that I"
630000,635760," it only occurred to me now that my eye is trained for is not just the video game graphics pixel"
635760,644960," peeping, but cameras. I spend so much of my life working on one side or another of a camera."
644960,651200," And so when I see something like this, like this, this is such a perfect example where I go,"
651200,659520," nah dog, this this ceiling, this rooftop, this roof up here absolutely has strong reflections on"
659520,666320," it because of the reflectiveness of this water. This is not correct. It's very obvious to me"
666320,672240," because I know what a webcam should look like. But see, you can see it's doing a much better job"
672240,677440," of it here after our protagonist takes even just a few steps forward. That wouldn't happen in the"
677440,683760," real world. It would be more gradual that kick animation though. Come on. But the door movement"
683760,687680," and stuff, the door movement's pretty good. Like there there there. I don't want to I don't want"
687680,693120," to trash on certain aspects. That's very fake. Very fake. Very fake. What is this flashlight? Look"
693120,697920," at it. Come on. You can get extremely focused flashlight. Yeah, you can get extremely focused"
697920,702080," flashlights, but they wouldn't have a beautifully defined circle around them like this."
702080,712400," No dog. No. This looks great. Oh yeah. One of the things that I thought of in the"
712400,718080," no clip demo to make it like more believable, he should have done object interaction. He should"
718080,722320," have like picked an object and like moved it around, replaced it somewhere. Right. But it's"
722320,726560," it's area scans. So I don't even think you can. Right. Do you want to explain what area scans are?"
726560,730960," Because I think a lot of people are probably looking at this going, this is blowing my mind."
730960,735440," Level of detail. How can anything have this kind of graphical fidelity? Because there was another"
735440,739840," demo that popped up recently of like a village or something. I'm going to try and find it. Okay."
739840,746560," But it was also photorealistic and apparently done by a single developer. Don't quote me on any"
746560,751280," of this though, because I'm a little bit. Again, when I was talking to Jaden about this before the"
751280,758160," show, he looked up and I think if I remember correctly, I don't want to misquote him. I think he found"
758160,766560," that they like worked with some company to get scans. And he was saying that like the area that"
766560,772320," they scanned isn't necessarily yeah, quixel mega scan. There we go. I think that's what he said too."
772320,778640," So it's not necessarily that the area that they scanned is in this exact configuration."
779360,784400," But they could have made it. They could have like, you know, cut it up. So through this door might"
784400,788640," have been like some, I don't know, medical room or something. But they're like, oh, we don't want"
788640,792320," that. We want that to be another part of the warehouse. So they just like move it there. And"
792320,796880," they can do that. But these are these are, this is like an existing area that they could have"
796880,802480," chopped up or just not. So when you notice things like something that stood out to me"
802480,807440," on my like first pass was the green when I first looked at it."
807440,814080," Should I be on these green? Oh, yeah, here we go. These green banners or whatever these are."
814080,820080," I was like, oh, they all have unique graffiti. Like, why would they like bother to do that?"
820080,826080," Right. And then that's, I almost immediately was like, is this some type of scan? And then,"
826080,830000," yeah, Jaden without me even prompting like immediately looked it up. And yeah, it was."
830000,835520," That's another thing too, because it's a scan, three dimensional things. Like, for example,"
835520,842320," the textures, we see some some dumpsters and stuff inside later. Those textures do not"
842320,846240," look three dimensional enough as you move around. They're quite flat."
846240,851120," Look at this banner. Yeah, really quick. This just looks like it's a different color when you get"
851120,856960," close. Yeah, it looks like it's shading. It's flat. But as you go by, it's it's it's flat, right?"
856960,863120," Yeah. If this scan technology improved to the point where you could scan in three dimensions,"
864720,867840," like two like more finely, obviously, this is a three dimensional scan."
867840,871520," And it might have just been that like they didn't spend enough time on that one,"
871520,875680," like sheet of plastic or whatever that thing is on the fence. And like, maybe if they got more"
875680,881440," detailed scans of that individual thing, they could have actually gotten that depth. But it's,"
881440,887360," it's really impressive what they're able to do with this like photogrammetry, scanning stuff."
887360,893680," There's also, there's people that have been scanning buildings using this. And then just bringing in"
893680,901040," the untextured, like depth maps. Yeah. And then texturing them with mid journey textures."
901040,906800," Just really, really interesting. One way or another, even if it's not the kind of thing that,"
906800,912720," you know, I can look at and go, wow, this is definitely body cam footage, because it's definitely not."
912720,917840," It's not some people are talking about the flashlight still. It's not just that it's a perfect circle."
918560,926720," That's pretty normal. What it is, is the way that the flashlight is static. Okay. So the edges are"
926720,931360," kind of blurred here. If we go back to it again for a second here, yeah, Atari and Fulpin"
931360,935360," Chate just said you can 3d scan. Yeah, that's why I said like they might just not have taken as much"
935360,940560," time on that like one sheet of whatever, because it's probably not that big video. So come look at"
940560,945360," this. Here's something they could do to improve this a little bit. You see how it has this, this"
945360,952960," kind of halo around it. A real person holding a real flashlight would have jitter rotationally"
952960,960080," and side to side and up and down. It has no rotational jitter. So it's just a static. It's like it's"
960080,967040," a map applied to the light output that is coming from this from this gun. It's always the same"
967040,973520," kind of haze. That's what makes it look unnatural. That's what makes it look incorrect, not true to"
973520,978720," the real world. Some people are still in the chat saying I'm actually still questioning this."
978720,983920," Freddie Wong has done videos where he shoots actual video made to look like a video game. Guys,"
983920,990880," no, this is in engine. It's just getting that cool. Check this out. This is the one I was talking"
990880,999680," about from Tai Chi Kobayashi. It's not quite as because of the way the camera moves. It's more"
999680,1005360," video game-like. It's not as convincing. You can see some fish eye to the lens. But yet,"
1005360,1009360," the lens is not quite where your eyes would be. It doesn't have that vignetting that gives it"
1009360,1014000," that really convincing goggle effect. I think that's part of why the other one's so convincing too,"
1014000,1020080," is it really feels like you're looking through goggles. But in terms of the scans, in terms of"
1020080,1027200," the photorealism of this, guys, games are coming. They're going to look like this. This is freaking"
1027200,1030800," cool. It doesn't matter. It's like that waterfall doesn't seem legit."
1030800,1036960," Yeah. But it. With that house. Oh, for a second there, when there was none of the outside,"
1036960,1041520," that looked like it could have been a Google Maps screenshot. Yeah. It looks like a picture."
1041520,1048800," Look how different and independently waving. All this greenery is. It's the greenery on this one."
1048800,1052720," I'm not going to play the whole thing because I want you guys to go watch it. It's just"
1052720,1058880," UE5 environment art, Cliffwood Village. Go check this out, guys. That's wild. I've never seen that."
1058880,1064400," It's all. I have to go watch that. It's beautiful. It's art. Yeah. That's okay. So that's one of my"
1064400,1072640," biggest, I guess, red flag concerns about this thing is how many people it convinced and how"
1072640,1078240," realistic it is. It's very, very impressive. Yes, there's some tells, but it's extremely impressive."
1078880,1083600," With a little bit of AI and a little bit of a little bit more polished, a little bit AI,"
1083600,1087680," give it three or four years. The old when I was first growing up, I thought you were,"
1087680,1091600," I thought you were getting into how this could be dangerous, like faking things or what. Oh,"
1091600,1095440," that is where you're going. Oh, good. When we were first growing up, it was Pixar. It didn't happen,"
1095440,1100400," right? And then that pretty quickly was like video or it didn't happen. Video or it didn't happen."
1100400,1106480," What's truth now? That's like gone. Jayden was saying, you know, you combine a bunch of these"
1106480,1110560," things. You combine as far as this has gotten in regards to realism with the movement and stuff"
1110560,1115360," like that. Yeah. You combine that with a little bit and it'd be tougher for me to tell."
1115360,1119680," Like part of how I can tell is how sharp it is. Yeah. Yeah. That's something I didn't even"
1119680,1124960," mention. It looks too good for like body cam or webcam or like GoPro footage. It's too sharp."
1124960,1129680," Too high quality. A lot of those things are very, they're buying for like the entire country's"
1129680,1133040," police force, right? So like they're, they're, they're usually going to be pretty cheap. They"
1133040,1139360," don't look that good. But yeah, you combine deep fakes in terms of how people look. You combine"
1139360,1145920," the, the like voice, emulation, stuff that people are doing. You combine a lot of the stuff that we"
1145920,1151120," see in here and even slightly improve all those things by a little bit. And the average person"
1151120,1158800," is not going to be able to tell. Like at all. Yeah, this is wild. And as long as you can have"
1158800,1162720," a legitimate debate where there's a significant amount of people on both sides,"
1162720,1169040," then what is like representable truth other than I witnessed this is great. Bixby in the"
1169040,1175760," float plane chat says live stream where it didn't happen. I mean, have you seen some of the unmaskings"
1175760,1182800," that have happened with like the biggest ones that I'm aware of were some live streamers in China"
1182800,1188560," where they were pretty much wearing the appearance of a completely different looking person."
1188560,1192800," What? No, I've never heard of this. Really? I thought we've talked about this on the show before."
1192800,1200560," I don't think so. Okay, hold on. Let me see if I can find it. Beauty YouTuber exposed during"
1200560,1208000," live stream. Yeah, here we go. Here we go. Yeah, this is it. This is her. This is her."
1208000,1216240," So it's like real time appearance modification. You see those like filter things on,"
1216240,1219920," yeah, on TikTok and stuff. Yeah, exactly. So I don't like they don't exist elsewhere."
1219920,1224560," Yeah, 100%. And when you're running them on more powerful hardware, you can do more"
1224560,1230720," outlandish things with it. So live stream where it didn't happen. Nope. Yeah, we have nothing left."
1230720,1234160," The second it's video or it didn't happen live stream where it didn't happen is already"
1234160,1238800," basically out the window. Well, it's harder to apply those effects live. I mean, you look it"
1238800,1248000," again back to Shane. If you can do it. Dragons are real. If you can do it, if you can do it,"
1248000,1253360," not in real time being able to do it in real time is coming. That's what I'm saying. Like,"
1253360,1257760," eventually a computer will get fast enough and it can just do it. That's fine. Yeah,"
1257760,1262160," it'll be it'll be right around the corner. Companies like Nvidia will make sure that happens."
1263600,1269280," I do want to jump into the LTT merch stuff for this week a little bit sooner than we normally"
1269280,1274240," would just because I don't want to see people ordering this and not taking advantage of the promo."
1274240,1281600," It's very unusual for us to do this, but we actually have a launch promo coming with the item"
1281600,1290800," that we are announcing this week. Meet the way hoodie."
1290800,1302640," Is a little tiny one hoodie for your dog. Yeah. It's so cute. It has all the same features and"
1302640,1308480," quality that you've come to expect from the regular human sized when hoodie, but now in a"
1308480,1315440," convenient size for small to medium sized dogs. It also has some dog specific features."
1315440,1321200," So the hood can be buttoned back to keep it out of the way of your furry companion."
1321200,1326080," There is a leash hole that passes through the hoodie into the inside."
1326080,1332880," So you can run your leash through it. It does have a kangaroo pocket here."
1332880,1337760," Does it actually go all the way through? Hilarious. It does go all the way through."
1337760,1341600," We actually went way over the top in terms of the quality of the construction."
1341600,1346320," Like it's even got the same built in orange accents on the sleeves."
1346320,1352720," But anyway, the point is that on the back it's got this little kangaroo pouch and a working"
1352720,1359280," YKK of course waterproof zipper that you can put, you know, I don't know,"
1359280,1366640," extra like emergency doggy bags or condoms for all the action you're going to be getting"
1366640,1369760," because your dog is so cute and you strike up so many conversations."
1369760,1374000," I can't believe your dog is a hoodie. I know, right?"
1374000,1378800," Small to medium sized dogs. If you go on the side, oh, right, right."
1378800,1382480," So I was going to mention the promo. Normally we don't do launch promos,"
1382480,1388640," but we do have one today if you buy the WAN hoodie and a WEG hoodie."
1388640,1396000," It's 2499 for the WEG hoodie, but if you buy them together, you will get a $10 discount"
1396000,1399760," that's applied automatically at the checkout. You can match your dog."
1399760,1405920," So you can match your dog. It's not super resistant. So if your dog was like a little bit big,"
1405920,1411040," it would be okay. Yeah, but do please follow the size guide very carefully."
1411040,1417280," We are hoping to expand our available sizes to accommodate larger dogs, but not for now."
1417280,1420240," Not for now. So cute."
1423600,1428160," I don't know what you're talking about, Pretzel Parkour. I don't know."
1428160,1431040," Apparently we no longer accept a perfectly worked customer support."
1431040,1433760," Yeah, all you can do is contact support and we'll try and get you sorted out."
1433760,1439040," I mean, better for us to not take your money than to take your money and like not, you know,"
1439040,1440560," deliver it, I guess. Yeah."
1440560,1442160," Doing okay. Just needs to contact customer support."
1442160,1446000," Yeah, you got to contact support. Look at this. Hey Ripley."
1446000,1449840," I can't believe Jake put this thing on his cat."
1451520,1461120," Wait, yep. Oh man. It is so fun that we have so many of our staffers come in to"
1461120,1468960," you know, model the merch and bring in their dogs. What a fun shoot. Hey, there's Dennis and Charlie."
1468960,1470720," Good boy, Charlie."
1470720,1476240," Oh, that was a weird spot for my cursor with it on his eye like that."
1476240,1479200," I love how his cat doesn't even seem to like mine."
1479200,1481200," Oh, no, Arlo's chill, whatever."
1481200,1482320," That's sweetest weather."
1482320,1486880," Arlo gives zero F's. We have a couple of other things to announce this week."
1486880,1489680," We have two new limited edition sticker packs,"
1489680,1493520," computer cats and gaming dogs. So these are going to be in the bonus bin."
1493520,1500640," I mean, you can just buy them if you really want to, but they are bonus bin items, I think."
1500640,1502080," I'm pretty sure they're bonus bin items."
1502080,1506320," So these are actual dogs of Linus Media Group."
1507120,1510240," I don't know all of their names. Maybe that's..."
1510240,1511280," It is a bonus bin item."
1511280,1513840," It's a bonus bin. Okay, good. Maybe that's something we specify,"
1513840,1517520," but I do know this cat is dash. That's my cat."
1517520,1520400," I'm pretty sure, oh, this has got to be Arlo."
1520400,1527120," I'm not sure all of the other cats necessarily, but yep, they're all actual cats of actual people"
1527120,1531760," who work here. And I'm sure Sarah knows who they belong to."
1531760,1536160," And then the final thing is we have just launched our mystery plaid."
1536160,1539840," So the latest addition to our popular mystery series,"
1539840,1545520," if you want to get a deal and you don't necessarily care what color of plaid flannel you get,"
1545520,1549520," you can pick up the mystery plaid flannel for $39.99 US."
1549520,1553360," It's the same great quality just in a mystery color."
1553360,1555920," So if you check out the..."
1555920,1559920," Yep, there it is. It could be this. It could be a this."
1559920,1562640," It could be a this or it could be a this."
1562640,1564400," Very cool."
1564400,1570720," Someone asked, is there a behind the scenes video of the photo shoot of the"
1570720,1573120," wag hoodie? I don't know."
1573120,1577040," And that could be a kind of fun idea, is behind the scenes of some photo shoots."
1577040,1580000," We have. We have done one. Yeah, we did one with the three down jacket,"
1580000,1583920," but I'm not sure if they would have thought to do a behind the scenes of this one."
1583920,1588880," That would be a great question for our community coordinator who..."
1588880,1594160," Yeah, it's not off probation yet, but I bet if you posted it on the subreddit or something,"
1594160,1597120," if you're like, \"Hey, attention LMG community coordinator,"
1597120,1599920," don't post a bunch of other random stuff because the only one I'm going to flag for"
1599920,1603440," him is this one.\" But if you're like, \"Hey, is there a behind the scenes coming?"
1603440,1605520," I'm sure he'd be happy to figure that out for you.\""
1605520,1607120," It's going to be like a million of those threads now."
1607120,1610640," I mean, I'll just tell him to ignore them. So it'll be fine."
1610640,1613600," I don't want to create unnecessary work for people, guys. There's no point."
1613600,1614240," Yeah."
1614240,1616800," All right. Why don't we jump into our next big topic?"
1616800,1622400," Switch modder released from prison with life-destroying fine."
1623440,1629680," This is a tough one because on the one hand, one of our other topics is going to be,"
1629680,1636560," \"Hey, thank goodness for a large fine for a change because if you don't have the fine,"
1636560,1644320," reflect the magnitude of the criminal action, then companies will just treat fines as"
1644320,1651040," cost of doing business and shrug them off.\" But in this case, we are talking about an"
1651040,1658480," individual, but an individual who engaged in commercial activities"
1658480,1667360," as part of their criminal endeavors. Let's get through this. Canadian fellow Canadian"
1667360,1675200," Gary Bowser has been granted early release from his 40-month prison sentence on grounds of good"
1675200,1680960," behavior and undisclosed health problems. The background here is that Bowser pled guilty"
1680960,1687520," to trafficking mod chips that allowed pirated games to be played on switch consoles in late 2021"
1687520,1693040," as part of his involvement in team Executor. Bowser was not a modder himself. His role was"
1693040,1699280," primarily PR and marketing. While Bowser's plea deal spared him substantial jail time,"
1699280,1708480," he's still facing a fine of $14.5 million, of which he has only paid $175 through"
1708480,1714240," menial jobs at the prison library and kitchen. Should Bowser get another job upon his return to"
1714240,1722640," Canada, his pay will be garnished 25-30% to service the fine that he owes Nintendo. Bowser is 52"
1722640,1728080," years old and has physical limitations due to his ill health. Assuming a typical life expectancy"
1728080,1735440," of 81 years, Bowser would have to earn $500,000 a year, not including living expenses in order to"
1735440,1744960," pay off his debt before he dies. This really does seem like cruel and unusual punishment."
1744960,1750320," Yes. The thing you brought up with like, \"Oh, we have another topic about a company getting"
1750320,1756400," slammed with a fine.\" Usually we don't. It is interesting that today we do happen to have one,"
1756400,1761520," but it is actually very uncommon. It's something that we very often talk about"
1761520,1767600," is how these companies getting slapped on the wrist finds for like 5-10% or less of the profit"
1767600,1771840," that they made doing a certain venture, just does nothing because that's just a cost of doing"
1771840,1779440," business for them. The scale of this is quite egregious though."
1779440,1786720," The fact that there's no time frame during which his wages are garnished, and look,"
1788240,1791760," you know what? I mean, I was about to draw parallels to child support where I say like,"
1791760,1797360," \"Look, we're not talking about another innocent life that Gary Bowser walked out on and is refusing"
1797360,1803520," to support or something like that.\" Even with fucking child support, when they become an adult,"
1803520,1809840," you're no longer obligated to pay it. How does this make any sense?"
1812800,1822400," And coming back to a punishment that is proportionate to the means, right? To the capabilities"
1822400,1829760," of the person being punished or the entity being punished, on the one hand, I'm looking at it"
1829760,1836640," going, \"Yeah, okay. So, garnishing wages, I guess, is better than taking 100% all the time, forcing"
1836640,1842000," him to put up a cup on the street and then literally take that and give it to Nintendo."
1842000,1849200," Obviously, I guess it's better than that, but it is clear, it is obvious that this 14 and a half"
1849200,1859040," million dollar sentence is completely unattainable. He's also just probably screwed. If we can have"
1859040,1864080," a probably unfortunate conversation here, cost of living right now is insane."
1864080,1870320," Well, yeah. A huge percentage of people I know, if their wages just got deleted by 25 to 30%,"
1870320,1874800," they're just screwed. Yeah, they're out. They're like out of the house on the street immediately"
1874800,1883120," screwed. And he's stuck with that for life. And there's nothing in our talking points about this,"
1883120,1889120," but I would have to make the assumption that Nintendo would have thought of him just declaring"
1889120,1897520," bankruptcy and walking away from it, hence the wage garnishing. So, there's just no way out."
1897520,1903520," No. I mean, honestly, like the chance that he's going to start making would be better off in prison."
1903520,1910560," Very possibly, because I honestly, I don't like a minimum security prison. If he doesn't have job"
1910560,1916720," prospects lined up that are very, very lucrative, then he's going to be on the street anyways, like I."
1923040,1930160," I'm I've been trying to think of like solutions. Yeah, because you think if it was like,"
1930160,1937280," it doesn't start getting garnished until he makes a minimum of some amount of money per year."
1937280,1940880," Okay, I mean, I have to be able to earn a livable wage before the garnishing."
1940880,1945360," Yeah, we can play kind of point counter point here a little bit. Like I'll play devil's advocate."
1945360,1949440," Just to be clear, that's what I'm doing. But my defense to that, if I'm Nintendo, right,"
1949440,1954000," is well, then he's just going to carefully not declare any income above that amount and we get"
1954000,1959360," nothing. Yeah, so the country can't just take another homeless person though, like you're like,"
1959360,1965200," I know if that rule, I know you're playing devil's advocate. I know. But that's what they would say."
1965200,1971920," I get that. But as the country of like Canada, I would just be like, no, because it's going to"
1971920,1976800," cost the country a ton of money in this situation. Sure."
1977280,1983120," But if I'm Nintendo, I'm kind of going, well, that sure as heck isn't my problem."
1983120,1988800," And my copyright was infringed. Yeah, so welcome to the limitations. I don't know."
1988800,1993840," Yeah. I don't think a company should be able to just like decide that someone's going to be"
1993840,1999760," homeless for the rest of their lives. That's crazy to me. Like unacceptable. And absolutely ridiculous."
1999760,2005920," And what's really mind blowing to me is how, I mean, I guess that's sort of part of the cruel"
2005920,2015040," and unusual punishment, right? It's the unusualness of it. So countless, countless people have been"
2015040,2020640," involved in whether we want to talk about what were they called our four chips or whatever for the"
2020640,2025840," DS like in was a court not a company. So I've heard sorry, sorry, I just, I see a bunch of people"
2025840,2032720," saying it was a court not a not a company. That is like in a lot of ways true. Yeah,"
2032720,2038400," because the company can ask for whatever. Yes. And lawyers and all this, this whole structure"
2038400,2043200," will encourage you to ask more than it's the, it's the whole bargaining thing, right?"
2043200,2047920," I want to sell this thing. I'm going to ask for like, start high, settle less high. Yeah. So they're"
2047920,2052800," expect it's going to be a very difficult conversation to convince them to ask for what they actually"
2052800,2058000," want because nothing is structured to work that way. Also, it's Nintendo. So what they want"
2058000,2066160," probably is blood. Yeah, probably they're like massive jerks. But the court did push it through."
2066160,2072960," So it really it is on the court. And that's just, I'm just mad at everybody. I just want to make"
2072960,2078240," that part clear. Like I, it's, I'm not, I'm not saying the court is, is not to blame blah blah blah"
2078240,2082800," I just think this is whatever I don't personally care. I don't know enough about that kind of stuff."
2083760,2090880," The, the result is not okay. Yeah. Our discussion question here is actually addresses how unusual"
2090880,2097120," this harsh punishment punishment is and kind of asks the question, does this actually reduce piracy?"
2097120,2103280," Or I mean, knowing what we know about human nature, the way people gamble, right? Are people"
2103280,2108080," just going to keep making mod chips? I think it's going to be way worse. Are for cartridges and"
2108080,2116080," whatever else, knowing that they probably will escape any kind of punishment at all. And probably"
2116080,2120320," someone else is just going to get strung up to the tree while they continue to run a mock."
2120320,2126640," All I've seen online about this in a, in a lot of the circles that I end up seeing is just people"
2126640,2131440," deck thumping like just pirate everything from Nintendo you possibly can. That's the main"
2131440,2135840," communication I've seen out of this. Like they're not, they're not succeeding in peep in making"
2135840,2140720," people not mad. So now there's some, there's some really good points that are being brought up by"
2140720,2146000," the float plane chat right now. Vinil says I've seen allegations that the mod chip company,"
2146000,2151920," not him personally, but the company brought in an astonishing amount of revenue up to $10 million"
2151920,2160560," over time. And that is fair enough. It is well within Nintendo's right to chase that lost revenue."
2160560,2168240," But it's pretty clear that Gary Bowser doesn't have it. Yes. So what? Just because he was the"
2168240,2174560," one that you managed to nail down. So you shouldn't go. So, so are it feels like they're,"
2174560,2179840," they've gone after like a low level mob crony. And you know, pretty much,"
2179840,2184480," you know, book on them. Yeah, staple them to the cross and kind of gone."
2185360,2192800," Ha ha. We did it guys. Business. When the boss is still walking free, this is not the win that"
2192800,2199920," you think it is because if organized crime has taught us anything, it's that there's always"
2199920,2205360," someone low down who is going to be put in the way to take the fall. Said to the machine"
2205360,2212720," to satiate whoever or whatever else. And I'm not saying that what what Mr. Bowser did is"
2212720,2217840," justifiable. No, I'm not saying that it was legal. No. I'm just saying that"
2217840,2226000," compared to almost anything else that I have seen, this really does seem to fit the definition"
2226000,2232240," of cruel and unusual punishment. Yeah. To not just penalize what someone has,"
2232240,2238480," but what they will ever have when we're not talking again, we're not talking about a"
2238480,2242320," situation where it could be justified. We're not talking about the livelihood and well-being of a"
2242320,2248880," child, you know, that had no choice in the matter. I mean, I guess Nintendo had, well,"
2248880,2253840," they did have a choice in the matter, actually. They didn't have to pursue such a ridiculous"
2253840,2260960," punishment. Yeah, and like the court, the court put it through. So just like re-upping that."
2260960,2266880," Yeah. Yes, the court put it through massive problem. But Nintendo also had the option to get the,"
2267920,2275360," to get the verdict and basically say, well, we're happy to reduce this. We're happy to reduce this,"
2275360,2280000," but let this be because that's a big part of what Nintendo thinks is such a win here is that"
2280000,2286480," this is a precedent now. Now they've got a precedent to point to and go, yeah, that's right. Don't do it."
2286480,2292560," But it could have been. They could have made an example out of Gary Bowser without actually"
2292560,2297680," destroying the rest of his life. And you know what? From my point of view, if this had then come"
2297680,2304400," up again, case number two, and they'd gone, all right, we're litigating this again. We've got our"
2304400,2310960," precedent now. We're throwing the full book at them. I could even see it. At least they fired a"
2310960,2316560," warning shot. I still don't think so, because like there's no, there's no limitations on this."
2316560,2321680," I'm not saying it would be right. I'm saying it would be better than this. I wouldn't have even"
2321680,2327120," thought I wouldn't have even thought this is possible. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The fact that"
2327120,2334960," there's no statute of limitations whatsoever. The fact that the cost of living, like the"
2334960,2343120," livable wage in, I think he's in Toronto. I don't know. I don't remember the cost of living"
2343120,2348560," livable wage in Canada in general, but especially in like Vancouver, Toronto, Montreal, these types"
2348560,2356240," of places is so high. Like the cost of living in Canada versus the average income is a really,"
2356240,2361840," really rough calculation right now. Canada is constantly falling and averaged GDP."
2361840,2367760," Like you look at like the states versus Canada and the states as incomes and Canada's incomes"
2367760,2371920," are going up at relatively similar rates, but Canada's cost of living is going up at a higher"
2371920,2378720," rate. So like we're getting less like whatever you call it, play with money after your cost of"
2378720,2385920," living constantly. Canada is getting really, really rough to be in. Now he has to do 25 to 30% more"
2385920,2392880," on top of that. And as far as I know, doesn't have job prospects lined up. Like the other thing that's"
2392880,2399840," really offending me here, I think sofa king stupid over on Twitch, proving their username kind of"
2399840,2406480," inaccurate here points out. And this is a really good point that maybe part of what we're so"
2406480,2412480," mad about right now, even if we didn't think of it is the number of white collar crimes like this"
2413360,2419360," that by comparison, just get a little slap on the wrist. That was our intro point, man. Oh, I don't"
2419360,2423920," know. I was just mad about talking about companies, I guess, but yeah, you're talking about even"
2423920,2427920," individual white collar crime. I mean, why is the wolf of Wall Street walking free? Yeah."
2427920,2438320," Why why why doesn't he owe whatever for the rest of his life? To be clear, I don't know the exact"
2438320,2444400," details of what went down in that particular particular takedown. The point is that it doesn't"
2444400,2452480," matter, right? There's plenty of examples. Like the 2008 financial crisis, did anyone even get"
2452480,2458320," jail time? Pretty, I don't think so. I don't know much about it, but I don't think so. Yeah, I think"
2458320,2464800," I remember reading there's like one or two like, right, like a huge array of people, like you should"
2464800,2471440," not have just been that one, apparently one guy, yeah, as if one person did the whole thing. Sure."
2471440,2476880," Okay. Yeah, I don't know. I'm just I'm pissed. I hate this. It's stupid. You shouldn't be able to"
2476880,2482320," condemn someone. And that's basically what that's basically what this is. Yeah. Yeah. Like, oh,"
2482320,2490320," here's a perfect example. What's what's her? What's her face? The one that that had the college,"
2490320,2502160," like scholarships company or something like that. College scholarships, scam startup."
2502160,2512960," Man, I this is really great. Charlie. Oh, I thought it was. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Here we go. The"
2512960,2519520," startup founder who fooled JP Morgan into spending $175 million on her startup by just fabricating"
2519520,2525120," accounts. I don't I don't actually think she's been sentenced yet, but this reminds me I've read"
2525120,2532560," a really funny article. I'm funny and weird. It was an article that investigated how many of Forbes"
2532560,2543840," is 30 under 30? Eventually ended up like in prison. It was like a lot like Sam Bankman freed her."
2547200,2551840," The Martin Screlly. I don't know if he was four of 30 under 30, but it seems like he probably"
2551840,2555680," would have been might have been on the list. Not sure. But then there was the one with the fake,"
2555680,2562480," I think diabetes testing thing. Oh, Elizabeth Holmes. Yeah. Yeah. Hold on. Hold on. That was"
2562480,2568240," her thing, I think. Wow. She's the second most popular Elizabeth after Olsen and before banks,"
2568240,2573520," according to my search history anyway. Anyway, she has appealed her unjust conviction apparently."
2574320,2579920," So like, okay, she wants to stay out of prison. Someone in Twitch chat said,"
2579920,2583920," didn't Gary Bowser commit wire fraud install ransomware on people's devices and a bunch of"
2583920,2589120," other non-Nintendo related crimes? Isn't that what he got really messed up over? At no point in time"
2589120,2594400," in this conversation, did we ever say that he was a good person? Yeah. I don't know anything about"
2594400,2602960," him. Not even once. Nope. What I said, what I started out with was that in the Canadian charter"
2602960,2607680," of rights and freedoms, etc, etc. I think we have a constitution too actually. Now I think about it."
2607680,2612560," I can't remember what the documents are called. Doesn't matter. The point is that cruel and unusual"
2612560,2621680," punishment is not cool. And this really feels like it to me. Yeah. All right. Let's move on to"
2621680,2626320," our next segment here. I just want to explain merge messages. Those of you who are new to the"
2626320,2632400," show might think, oh, I should send a super chat or some Twitch bits. Hey, how about you don't do"
2632400,2638400," that? And instead of feeding some more money into the overflowing coffers of Amazon and Google,"
2638400,2644640," you could send a merge message instead. The main benefit is that instead of just digital pixels on"
2644640,2650960," a screen, you can get digital pixels on a screen and your order in the mail from lttstore.com."
2650960,2654640," All you have to do to send a merge message, which will get your little shout out, you know,"
2654640,2659600," Hey, mom or happy birthday, Janice or whatever it is that you want to put down there. You can"
2659600,2664240," get that popping up on the bottom of the screen and you will get your order in the mail. I say that"
2664240,2668880," part right in order to do that. All you have to do is go to lttstore.com. Check out whether it's"
2668880,2674800," some of our new items like the Weght hoodie or the mystery plaid flannel. And then in the checkout,"
2674800,2680960," you will see a box that will prompt you to fill it out if we are live and leave us a merge message."
2680960,2685280," We will go through them to the best of our ability. I am not going to promise that we are going to"
2685280,2690880," get through all of them. Our dashboard has been upgraded. This is super cool. Hold on a second."
2690880,2696960," I am just going to show my dashboard real quick. We now have merge messages per minute."
2696960,2701120," Oh, where did it go? It was here. Here we go."
2701120,2704960," Yeah, I don't know. I thought it was cool. We just upgraded the dashboard."
2704960,2707600," What? It's cool. Yeah."
2707600,2711360," Merge message per minute is three and then oh, watch this next announcement. So you are going to see"
2711360,2714320," it. Did it go? Is it going to go? I might go."
2714320,2718720," Something. Anyway, the point is our cool little dashboard got some upgrades. Hey, thanks float"
2718720,2724960," plane team. And so we will go through them and to the best of our ability answer as many of them"
2724960,2728960," as we can. Dan, you want to hit us with some merge messages? Sure. First one is up here from"
2728960,2737440," Bucky. It's eager for a bigger wag hoodie. He's got a 90 pound GSD 38 inch chest. Any advice"
2737440,2745280," for an unemployed embedded C programmer with no online portfolio? How to catch up on programming"
2745280,2751920," shifts from the past 20 years? Yeah. I knew that ending was coming. Sorry, I'm not trying to laugh"
2751920,2760240," at you. Wow. Whoo. Embedded C. I mean, Luke."
2763040,2769920," What? Go ahead. Oh, yeah. Wow. Do you want to is a question that I would ask? Because there are"
2769920,2776160," still jobs for that. Like, do you want to just look for one of those? You don't technically have to"
2776160,2783840," have a portfolio thing. What is this? What did you do? I didn't do anything. Nothing. There's"
2783840,2793200," something else going on. Okay. That's really wacky. But anyways, sorry, that's extremely"
2793200,2797040," distracting. I'm going to click on another window so it stops doing that to me. All right, we're good."
2797040,2805120," Yeah, I would just try to continue with a job in your fields. There's work for embedded C programmers."
2805120,2810640," They're like, definitely is. I know you don't have an online portfolio, but"
2811440,2815680," if you've been doing it for 20 years, it sounds like you should be able to pass a coding test or"
2815680,2821200," something else. Like, I don't know. Yeah. So basically you're saying probably it would be"
2821200,2827520," easier to change careers outright instead of like, instead of like fully reagent. Well, no,"
2827520,2833120," not 100%. But instead of like fully reeducating to like some web programming setup, which is"
2833120,2839040," actually very different than like embedded C programming, I would just try to stay in that lane"
2839040,2845280," where there is definitely still work, right? Not probably as much work, but there's definitely"
2845280,2855040," still work. If you do want to flip over, there's an absolute vast ocean of free programming learning"
2855040,2861600," tools. Learn to code, I believe is literally a website. I know it was like a saying a while ago,"
2861600,2866720," but I think it's a website now. There's leak code. There's code free code camp. There's"
2867680,2872080," if you want to pay for courses, there's some courses from is it called Udemy? I believe it's"
2872080,2877280," Udemy, right? That are supposed to be really good. There's tons of places to relearn, but yeah,"
2877280,2879920," you don't have to. You don't have to. All right, hit us again."
2879920,2886560," Okay. Next up from low Luke, do you think that with the latest generation of AI tools,"
2886560,2890800," Mike is muted. Luke, do you think that with the latest generation of AI tools,"
2890800,2896560," that today's youth are going to be depriving themselves of background learning just by getting"
2896560,2903520," exactly what they ask for from the model? I feel like that exact same question, but asked in a"
2903520,2907360," slightly different way with slightly different parameters could have been asked about things"
2907360,2914800," for the last huge amount of time. I think I would like to think, I don't know if this is true or not,"
2914800,2919520," I would like to think that most people are naturally curious and will learn more than they need to"
2919520,2924080," about things. And if you want to hit a certain level of excellence, they're going to have to do"
2924080,2930640," that. So I don't know. I think it will compromise it in the exact same way that people are generally"
2930640,2935360," not as good at mental math as they used to be because of the calculator, but it's not like people"
2935360,2941440," can't do math anymore. All right, here's again. All right, let's get into some rapid fire now too."
2941440,2949600," Linus wears the best place to post pupper picks. Pupper picks? Yes, of the dogs in the wag hoodie."
2949600,2953360," Oh, I mean, I'd love to see them on the forum. That would be freaking awesome. Also,"
2954000,2960080," the reviews on LTTstore.com do support image uploads, even though almost nobody uses that feature."
2960080,2966400," Both. So we would love to see pictures of your dog in the wag hoodie. And for that matter, we'd"
2966400,2972000," love to see pictures of your guys' setups with the desk pads or, you know, drinking from your water"
2972000,2977040," bottle, extra points if you if you Photoshop a speech bubble that says LTTstore.com while you're"
2977040,2983840," drinking. Yeah, yeah, I mean, on the ABCs of gaming, I had a couple people send me pictures of them"
2983840,2988480," reading it to their little ones, which is super touching. There, okay, these are rapid fire. So"
2988480,2995920," I'm supposed to go really fast. Any meat and grits, jeweled for LTX? Yes, it's called LTX. Awesome."
2995920,3001040," I'll be all over the place. The rest of the LTT team will be all over the place. And we're"
3001040,3006800," going to have a ton of awesome creators there, some of whom are going to have graciously offered"
3006800,3011840," to do meat and grits. I'm really excited. After you started Birch Messages, did YouTube or Twitch"
3011840,3019680," give you any push for getting away from Superchats or bits? No, I think YouTube was appropriately"
3019680,3025200," embarrassed that Superchats were not working properly. Yeah, they actually were working for"
3025200,3030800," a bit and they seem to be broken again. So that's pretty cool. I don't know what else to say other"
3030800,3039280," than, \"Hey guys, it's not like I turned them off. I'm happy to take money on YouTube if people just"
3039280,3043840," want to throw it at the screen and have their chat highlighted in the side window or whatever,"
3043840,3047920," by all means, go ahead and do your thing.\" But I just think that Birch Messages not only work"
3047920,3052960," properly, but they are a much better value for our viewers. Yeah, also some float point people"
3052960,3059680," just pointed out, you can edit your reviews and add a picture. Oh, okay. So if there's a review"
3059680,3062160," that you've already left and you want to add some picture context, you can do that."
3062160,3068000," I am buying this screwdriver to put together $20,000 worth of Ikea kitchen cabinets."
3068000,3074400," What tech in the kitchen that is nice touch, you would recommend? A drill."
3074400,3082640," A kitchen drill? No, I mean, do not use a hand screwdriver to assemble that much Ikea furniture."
3082640,3085440," For the love of all that is good, please use a power tool."
3087280,3096400," That's so much. Luke, what's the most frustrating bug you have ever had to deal with?"
3096400,3106960," It broke him. It's the Luke Bug. The one where I start thinking and then all I can see is an hour"
3106960,3113040," glass turning around inside my own brain. I'm not going to give it specific, but literally any time"
3113040,3118480," I go to be excited to show something to Linus and then it just immediately shatters in front of my"
3118480,3124240," eyes. I'll just insert that scenario instead of a particular bug. It happens a lot."
3124240,3130800," I'll be messing with this thing all day. And then I'll be like, \"All right, sweet. It's like"
3130800,3134240," our scheduled meeting time to go show Linus.\" He clicks on one thing and it's just like,"
3134240,3141680," I do have that effect on things. I mean, it's good because then we get to try to fix it before"
3141680,3148640," release it. But like, yeah. And last one, any updates on the LTT laptop bag?"
3148640,3156160," Yes. We're working on it. Amazing update. All right, let's jump into another topic here."
3156160,3163200," Game devs are cracking down on hardware cheating. We've talked a fair bit about hardware cheating"
3163200,3170400," in the past, but what's funny is this particular method of hardware cheating is not really what"
3170400,3178880," we focused on. So we had talked about things like a robot arm that would move your mouse for you"
3178880,3184400," to point out an enemy. So a type of aimbot that would be pretty much impossible for software to"
3184400,3190400," detect because there are no additional processes running alongside the game. But this still"
3190400,3195600," actually wouldn't stop that because a lot of those use normal mice. Right. But the thing is that"
3195600,3201120," this kind of hardware cheating isn't something that I ever really thought about in spite of the"
3201120,3206880," fact that I'm a bit of a keyboard mouse supremacist. I still didn't think of it. Activision,"
3206880,3213440," Bungie, and Ubisoft are evidently cracking down on cheating via hardware modules that allow the"
3213440,3220480," user to bypass standard software anti-cheat detection. So the kind of anti-cheat that they're"
3220480,3226880," detecting is users who are disguising their keyboard and mouse as a game controller."
3226880,3233520," Yes. And then competing in game controller lobbies with like the game lock obviously superior"
3233520,3239840," keyboard and mouse plus the like auto aim and aim lock that you get with a controller."
3239840,3246000," Unbeatable because now you can snap onto people way faster. You can switch targets way faster"
3246000,3249520," and all this other kind of stuff. But it will hold your aim or on the person."
3249520,3256720," Yeah. It's 360 no scope aim lock. Right. Like it's a huge advantage."
3256720,3262160," Yeah. So after Activision announced a new hardware pass through. So that's what it's called"
3262160,3265840," a hardware pass through detection system for Call of Duty a few weeks ago."
3265840,3272160," A large glut of these devices apparently flooded the second hand market. This is a cool"
3274560,3280880," maybe unintentional positive side effect of like gotcha mechanics is that it actually"
3280880,3286640," punishes people for cheating because when you lose your account. Yeah. You actually lose"
3286640,3290960," in game items that have your wheel value. Anyway, that's very much a side discussion."
3290960,3293760," I still wish we'd go back to you buy the game and just have the game."
3293760,3297360," As far as my understanding goes, a lot of them just don't care and they'll just buy the skins"
3297360,3303040," again. I mean, okay. Because like the the Tarkov people that cheat a huge percentage of them by"
3303040,3307120," the most expensive possible version of the game, which is like over two times the normal price."
3307120,3310400," And just has like more like inventory space and stuff."
3310400,3315280," They just don't they're paying for the cheat to they just money is their whales, right?"
3315280,3322000," I always sit down with my kids and I'm like, okay, is that real? No. Do we pay for that? No."
3322000,3330240," All right. Good. We can continue. Now an obvious solution to these issues would simply be to ban"
3330800,3340400," all pass through devices. However, and that's why this is here. Yeah. You would also be catching"
3340400,3348320," folks who rely on things like the adaptive controller in the crossfire controller is insanely powerful."
3348320,3352000," This is actually like one of the coolest devices that is released in a really long time because if"
3352000,3358320," you see all these little like kind of dots at the top, those are all accessible. Yeah, they're there."
3358320,3362480," Things like I think it's in here. We could take it out if we want it. But there's a huge rack of"
3362480,3369040," plugs on the back that you can plug more things into the adaptable controller. I had a friend recently"
3369040,3377440," who I think they like that. So basically every every function of the controller has its own"
3377440,3384640," three and a half millimeter jack that can be used to plug in some kind of device that is"
3385520,3392000," that is more more usable to. So if you if your if your arm is like locked to your side for some"
3392000,3397520," reason, you could have a joystick that presses up into your palm and you moved it around like this"
3397520,3402080," using your whole palm. Yeah. Instead of just your thumb. Yeah, the joystick connectors are USB and"
3402080,3406960," they're on the side. You could have a button that's near your head. And if you have mobility in your"
3406960,3412640," neck, so you could like lean into it, you could press a button using your head. I had a buddy recently"
3412640,3417600," who severely damaged one of their wrists. And I had suggested that they use one of these in"
3417600,3422720," in order to gain input into a game that they could use while having their hand in a cast."
3422720,3430640," These things are actually amazing and essential. Yes. So I was so proud of Microsoft when they"
3430640,3435040," released that. And I still think that's extremely cool that they're supporting it. And so if we were"
3435040,3442160," to ban, pass through devices, it would be really hard to tell the difference between a bad pass"
3442160,3446640," through device for cheaters and a pass through device for people who just want to play the game."
3446640,3451760," Yeah. Bungie in particular has emphasized they're focused on players who use these devices to"
3451760,3457680," gain an unfair competitive advantage and has explicitly reassured players who require adaptive"
3457680,3464080," tools to participate that they will not be banned. I mean, I'd be surprised if the odd."
3464080,3468960," You get accidentals? Yeah, there's going to be there's probably going to be some collateral"
3468960,3475200," damage here. But hopefully we can avoid too much of that because that is the last thing that people"
3475200,3481280," who rely on their adaptive controller to play need to deal with. In addition to device detection,"
3481280,3485360," the Bungie security team will be monitoring gameplay for unusual patterns of player behavior"
3485360,3489280," to indicate cheating. However, it is still possible and even likely that these systems,"
3489280,3492320," yeah, we'll sometimes flag players with a legitimate need."
3493840,3499360," Discussion question here. Bungie specifically defines cheating as using an outside tool to"
3499360,3504640," change the intended experience of the game, in this case by removing a challenge. Is this a"
3504640,3509760," good understanding of cheating and how would you define it? See, I wouldn't just say changing"
3509760,3514480," the intended experience of a game. I would say changing the intended experience of the game for"
3514480,3520080," another player because changing the intended experience of the game for myself is modding."
3521280,3525520," Changing the experience for someone else is screwing them over."
3525520,3532160," I had wanted to talk about this actually when we were discussing the Gary Bowser verdict,"
3532160,3539920," where I basically was going to say like time equals money. In a sense, that 14.5 million"
3539920,3546160," dollar sentence is basically like handing down multiple lifetime sentences if that's all that"
3546160,3551200," this person could ever earn. You kind of get what I mean. To me, it's the proportionality"
3551200,3559920," of the sentence that just makes absolutely no sense here. So in this same way, the way that I define"
3559920,3570640," wrong is in the way that it affects someone else. Now, obviously, there are limitations."
3570640,3578000," If someone were to follow me around and just sit there being upset and offended every time I used"
3578000,3586880," the word the, I would kind of go, well, then leave a goodbye also enjoy life as someone who's just"
3586880,3594560," perpetually offended by everything. He never said the sentence. Yeah, I was careful."
3594560,3599760," Respectful. Very good. Wasn't my purpose. I was trying to catch you."
3599760,3604720," But in this case, there is a reasonable expectation from that other player that they should be able"
3604720,3610240," to play the game without somebody impeding them in a way that was not expected, nor intended by"
3610240,3617680," the game developer. So in our mutually understood definition of what this experience is supposed"
3617680,3622000," to be, you're affecting not only your own, but you're affecting someone else's and in a way that"
3622000,3627280," is detrimental. And it's clearly the definition of cheating to me. It's clearly trying to break"
3627280,3632240," rules because like with the, with the keyboard mast is a controller thing that we're talking about,"
3632240,3637440," you can play with a controller or you can play with a keyboard. You're screwing with things to"
3637440,3641440," make it think that you're doing something that you're not. So there's clear intention here."
3641440,3647760," Yeah, I think the intent is another really, I think the intent is important, even if it's"
3647760,3655760," difficult to prove. Yeah. Either way, I mean, I'm generally pretty receptive to anything that"
3656640,3662960," makes the gaming playing field more level. And that rewards people who play the game properly"
3662960,3669040," and punishes cheaters. In this case, all I hope is that we don't see too many innocent users"
3669040,3677280," caught in the crossfire. Should we talk about the big C8 ban? Yeah, or rather the fine for"
3677280,3681760," violating an export ban? I feel like I've done all the topics up till now. C8 technology holdings"
3681760,3689600," has admitted to wrongdoing and agreed to pay 300, agreed to pay a $300 million fine to settle"
3689600,3698320," allegations that it sold 7.4 million hard disks to Huawei violating a 2020 export ban. This is the"
3698320,3704240," largest single administrative penalty ever levied by the US Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry"
3704240,3710880," and Security. And it is meant to represent double the estimated profit Seagate accrued from the"
3710880,3718240," illicit sales. Seagate's annual net income for 2022 was $1.6 billion. And their estimated profit"
3718240,3724400," from sales was a period because we don't have that note. I'm not sure what happened there."
3724400,3731360," But probably $150 million based on that the settlement was meant to be double the expected"
3731360,3735920," profits. That makes sense. So we can solve for X here. Let's go. Yeah, yeah, very good."
3736480,3742240," Some background information in August of 2020, the US Commerce Department expanded export"
3742240,3748160," restrictions against Huawei after they allegedly tried to allegedly try to obtain advanced technologies"
3748160,3753520," to undermine US national security. While Huawei's two other primary suppliers stopped shipments,"
3753520,3759520," Seagate continued sales for 11 months as Huawei's sole supplier. Seagate even extended multiple"
3759520,3765920," lines of credit worth $1 billion to Huawei to help them purchase more hard drives. And to be clear,"
3766880,3775760," everyone knew that this export ban was going on. Oh, yeah. It was like in all of the news. Yeah."
3775760,3780880," Yeah. We talked about it on a WAN show. That's even like probably one of the smaller ones"
3780880,3784480," talking about like every news agency, they want 100% knew what they were doing."
3784480,3792320," So here's what I want to know. On the one hand, I think you and I probably both agree that if a"
3792320,3799120," corporation breaks the law, the fine should be such that it really isn't worth it to break that law"
3799120,3804560," again. Yeah. And I think we would probably agree that this is positive in that sense."
3804560,3815360," But here's my problem with it is that it's it sort of comes across maybe not hypocritical, but"
3816560,3823760," I guess the cynic in me looks at this and goes, huh. So it turns out that you do know how to properly"
3823760,3830160," punish this sort of behavior when you actually care. But when the transgression is against the"
3830160,3837280," individual user, it's like, I don't know, $4 per user, you know, class action, whatever."
3837280,3840800," Actually, most of it just goes to the lawyers. This seems like a good system."
3840800,3842080," Yeah."
3843600,3850640," Where is this justice for individual users, particularly when it comes to data privacy,"
3850640,3856240," or when it comes to other rights violations? You know, how is it that, you know, someone like a"
3856240,3862240," trans union? Man, I remember being so mad trans unions own website back when I had to sign up for"
3862240,3867600," credit monitoring because something something my insurance wouldn't cover me unless I had credit"
3867600,3871600," monitoring something something and it doesn't matter. The point is I had to have this stupid"
3871600,3876720," service that I signed up for for credit monitoring because of some identity, something incident that"
3876720,3885440," took place and trans unions own website had a like a help article talking about the importance of"
3885440,3892160," two factor. And at the time, trans unions own accounts didn't support two factor. I pointed this"
3892160,3899200," out to the rep and they're just like, hmm. And how many how many breaches have they suffered?"
3900400,3905440," And so I know about least one. Yeah. And we're not talking breaches of trivial things, right?"
3905440,3911280," Like, you know, man, nothing's trivial. Nothing's trivial when it comes to to personal data. But"
3911280,3916080," we're talking, you know, sin numbers, which are are equivalent of an SSN, right? Social security"
3916080,3921920," number. These are things that while technically can be changed, are a royal pain in the butt to"
3921920,3928160," change and can be extremely beneficial to ne'er do wells, right? Like there's there's databases"
3928160,3932720," out there that are going to have basically every piece of information that you could ever want"
3932720,3938400," to keep out of people's hands. Pretty much across the board at this point, because nobody is actually"
3938400,3943520," punishing this stuff in a way that is meaningful and forces them to take data security seriously."
3943520,3947440," I mean, we went through this was an interesting conversation. I was complaining to Luke about how"
3947440,3954320," our new password manager takes a long time to open. And he was like, well, let me tell you about that."
3954320,3959920," That's because they are actually decrypting it. The reason our old password manager was so fast."
3959920,3966000," Well, yeah, it wasn't because it wasn't being stored at all times in an encrypted manner."
3966000,3973120," And I'm like, oh, that's freaking amazing. Then yeah, the usability of the stuff we're using now is"
3973120,3979680," genuinely worse in like a lot of ways, in my opinion. But theoretically, it's more secure."
3980560,3986000," So on the one hand, yeah, I'm happy. But on the other hand, no, I'm actually like pretty"
3986000,3992240," off, right? Because this is just yet another double standard. And I'm just kind of tired of it."
3992240,3997280," So, yeah, show us you actually mean business."
3997280,4005120," There. Dan, that just still says the thing we're doing. We did too."
4007440,4011440," We did go down keeping us in line. It's supposed to be additional topics."
4011440,4015840," Additional ones. As you can do as many as you want until I tell you to do something else."
4015840,4024960," Oh, all right. Cool. Well, your average consumer. Yeah. Posted a review of the LTT backpack."
4024960,4033120," Tech reviewer, pack rat, and lover of big backpacks. Judner Aura reviewed the LTT backpack."
4033120,4039520," He's a pros huge capacity, highly functional, comfortable, doesn't cause strain after long"
4039520,4044000," periods wearing it. Well built, great material and layout. He loves all the pockets and the"
4044000,4050320," compartments and anti theft features and RFID blocking cons might not be for everyone."
4050320,4056720," Sometimes you don't need big and it can be visually plain, somewhat boxy, a major downside"
4056720,4062320," for people looking for a more potentially in their opinion stylish backpack. Very loud"
4062320,4071200," orange inside would prefer teal. Really? Oh, dang it. Where's the plus?"
4071200,4075760," I don't think it's teal. I mean, it's tealish. What I'm looking at looks like black."
4075760,4082880," Oh, no, no, look over there. Oh. So he wants the Lux back. Anyway, carry on."
4082880,4089520," Summary quote. This is directly from him. If you're in the camp that you don't care about looks,"
4089520,4095520," you just want it to work well. You want it to do its job to the pinnacle of how it should be done."
4095520,4100000," This bag is absolutely for you. I'm taking that as a W. Big win. I'm taking that as a W."
4100000,4108800," Judner is a bit of a bag head. Okay, that came out wrong. But I think you understand what I"
4108800,4113040," didn't think of that way. You bloody bag head. Okay, no, not like that."
4113040,4119760," Thing. No, I don't think so. It kind of sounds like it's like a weird insult. Dan, can you confirm"
4119760,4123600," is that is that a thing? Just call someone a bag. Okay, perfect. He claims to be British."
4123600,4131120," Anyway, the point is that bag enthusiast. Okay, I'm going to finish the quote."
4131120,4134800," Cougar Hunter. Wait, sorry. What? Oh, I'm going to finish the quote. I need to stop Linus."
4134800,4141520," If you do care about looks, it's tougher. Kudos to Linus and the team. They made an amazing product"
4141520,4144560," worth every penny. You just got to see if it's something that fits your style."
4144560,4151680," You know what? It's all fair. It's good. I I consider that very fair because we knew what"
4151680,4157120," we were doing. People talk about how it's boxy and I'm like, yeah, that's how it fits so much stuff."
4157120,4161440," It's like perfectly snugly under an airplane. It's basically the size of an airplane carry-on."
4161440,4166800," Yeah. Like, what do you want from me? That's that's by design. It's it's because we expect people"
4166800,4174080," to be able to this is great. Oh, I love this. Judner's list and a picture of everything that he carries"
4174080,4182000," in the bag. This is fricking awesome. Okay. One laptop, sometimes two. That's by design because"
4182000,4188000," we know that so many people will have a personal and a work laptop with them sometimes at the same"
4188000,4195280," time, particularly for like when they're traveling, right? Three tablets. Okay. Extra phone. Yes."
4195840,4203440," Three portable gaming to okay. Really, man? I mean, you know what? These do address very"
4203440,4209520," different needs. A switch, a steam deck and a pocket. Yeah. I think. All right. Bunch of cables."
4209520,4216560," Heck yeah. Two pairs of headphones. All right. Hidden air tag. Love it. Two SSDs, USB hub and"
4216560,4224720," a portable charger. Man, I love this because honestly, I've only spoken with Judner a handful"
4224720,4229600," of times. Like I wouldn't describe us as best of friends. I definitely respect his work. And"
4229600,4233840," every interaction I've ever had with him has been extremely positive. But this is not just like,"
4233840,4241040," it's not paid. It's not, you know, my buddy doing me a solid or anything like that. This is what"
4241040,4247920," they call what's it called? Earned, earned media where someone actually saw the product, felt it was"
4248720,4255040," valid enough to not only cover it, but actually daily freaking drive it, use it for an extended"
4255040,4260800," period of time. And we still get the positive review. I don't think, I don't think we even"
4260800,4265280," sent it one to him. I would have to confirm that. I have no idea. I don't know. But I think,"
4265280,4271280," I think he might have bought it either way. Like I said, I've, I've been following his work for a"
4271280,4277040," long time. And I, I respect him. I don't think he would be the kind of person who would give a"
4277040,4282240," favorable review just because we did provide a review sample. But I actually don't know. So I'm"
4282240,4286560," gonna, I'm gonna find out. I will find out. I'm calling the person who would know Mr. Nick Light."
4286560,4297680," Do do do do. Who needs time off when you can talk to Linus about work."
4301200,4308960," This will go through at some point, maybe. Hello? Hello? Tell us? Hello? Unless, unless"
4308960,4314320," you have reached the voice. Oh, seriously? Okay. Unless it's all of us trying to do work in"
4314320,4319200," Linus just won't stop playing vampire survivors. What are you talking about? I don't know what"
4319200,4326080," you're talking about. I would never do that. You just call him in a different way. Yeah."
4329040,4331440," That way if he's like banging or whatever, he'll know it's important."
4331440,4349360," Is he out of breath? Hey, you're live on the WAN show. Hello? Hey, okay, hold on. I gotta,"
4349360,4354080," I gotta turn you up a little bit here. Hey, I just wanted to know, did we send Judner a backpack or"
4354080,4362000," did he buy it? I think he bought it. Okay, but you're not aware of us sending one to him."
4362000,4369440," Uh, not to mine recollection, but it's been a little while. So it is possible, but I think"
4369440,4374000," he bought it. Okay, if I don't remember it and you don't remember it, I'd say that's a pretty"
4374000,4378880," solid chance that we didn't send it to him. Okay, thanks, Nick. Okay, no worries. Bye."
4381040,4384480," All right, he's back to whatever he was doing now. I mean, it might get to take a second to get"
4384480,4389520," back in the mood, but yeah, yeah, yeah, or not. By now, he's probably, you know, settled in."
4389520,4395840," Anyway, the point is, hey, thanks for the review. Uh, appreciate it. Even if it had been more"
4395840,4402240," constructive, I would still have appreciated it. We really do value honest feedback. Um, but"
4403360,4410960," I'm definitely more excited about W's. I'll say that much. Uh, oh, okay. You know what? No,"
4410960,4415600," we'll talk about that later. Sorry. Dave, you want to pick a topic? Sure. Sure, sure, sure, sure, sure,"
4415600,4422480," sure. Uh, SpaceX Starship successfully explodes. Okay, that's, that's not actually that misleading."
4422480,4428160," Yeah. Yeah. Okay. That's, yeah, pretty much do go on SpaceX launched its new Starship rocket"
4428160,4433120," system yesterday. A few minutes later, the rocket experienced what SpaceX Twitter account called"
4433120,4438400," and their live stream and lots of other things a, because I, it's actually a actual terminology,"
4438400,4443360," a rud or a rapid unscheduled disassembly before stage separation, i.e."
4443360,4451440," Kaboom. Much online commentary has framed this as a failure, but it wasn't. It was a test flight"
4451440,4457440," for a new, more powerful rocket system. The flight was unmanned and there was no reported injuries or"
4460160,4465920," or damage to property beyond the rocket and its payload. That is not true at all. Uh, but I'll go"
4465920,4471040," into that in a second. SpaceX has previously warned that the odds of success were low and the primary"
4471040,4477120," purpose of the launch was to collect data and data collection. Did they do? Um, a bunch of things"
4477120,4486800," was very useful. The launch pad is gone. So there was damage to more things than, than just the rocket"
4486800,4493200," and its payload, because the launch pad was like burnt to an absolute. It's literally gone. There's"
4493200,4499680," a hole. Right. So that wasn't intended. Uh, and there's some, there's some ideas there. Um,"
4499680,4505360," there was environmental damage. Yeah, I'm assuming so. The, uh, the whole launch pad is gone and there's"
4505360,4511280," a huge hole. So I, you could call that environmental damage. Um, they have some plans of how to deal"
4511280,4515600," with that in the future. A lot of them actually, and I'm sure they'll address it, but that's,"
4515600,4520800," this is one of the whole goals of this thing, right? I, I, I'm intent, someone in Twitch,"
4520800,4528240," unintended launch pad removal. Yeah. You know, they, they rapidly prepped the site for new development."
4528240,4535280," Uh, uh, curvil space program style. Let's go. Yeah. Yeah. So I, I think is sweet. Um,"
4535280,4539840," someone apparently got hit by debris. Did they actually, uh, that's what someone's saying."
4539840,4544560," The car got hit 500 meters away, which is 500 meters from a launch site. Probably shouldn't perk"
4544560,4550240," your car there. Well, no, for next time. I mean, yeah, but also like, it could have been a lot"
4550240,4556320," more than 500 meters too. Yeah. Um, I'm not going to believe any of those things unless I see"
4556320,4561520," official details. Oh, is this a screenshot of the launch pad? Yeah. Okay. I'm coming over to your"
4561520,4569440," laptop. Yeah. So damage to only the Starship is a not so much, uh, because there used to be a flat"
4569440,4575680," launch pad there. We call that a whopsy doodles. Yep. But again, like they, as far as my understanding"
4575680,4579680," goes, they were aware that there might be some problems there. Yeah. And they already have plans"
4579680,4584240," for fixing it for next time. This is what tests are kind of about, right? Like there's going to be"
4584240,4592320," problems. The fact that it blew up was not, um, was not actually like an issue. It was fine."
4592320,4597200," They went into this 100% expecting that that could be a very likely outcome. Right. If, if my"
4597200,4601360," understanding was correct, they expected it to land in the water and be like not properly"
4601360,4607760," recoverable, even if it didn't blow up. So like, yeah, it's a thing."
4607760,4614400," Yeah. But yeah, that's cool. If you haven't seen it yet, I don't think we're going to show the"
4614400,4617680," footage here, but you should go watch it because it's actually like really cool. Yeah, it's pretty"
4617680,4621760," wild. Yeah. I've read some theories. I don't know how much of this stuff is true, but some of the"
4621760,4626960," issues with the launch pad are why some of the boosters didn't actually fire properly."
4626960,4632800," So the boosters not firing properly might not be as big of an issue as we initially thought,"
4632800,4636800," because I think it might be related to the launch pad. I don't know if that's true or not. I've seen"
4636800,4642160," a lot of information on this that has already been debunked. So yeah, looking to yourself, if you"
4642160,4649600," want the amount of armchair scientists has been very fun to watch. These idiots, they should have"
4649600,4656800," done this thing. Yeah, sure, dude. Yeah, but they say, yeah, like, there's plenty of things as far as I"
4656800,4661280," can tell from actual real sources that like they did think of, but you're going to think of different"
4661280,4666160," things forever. And at a certain point, you just need to test what you got. It's kind of like a"
4666160,4671440," lot of the things that I see in the comments under our videos. Like a really good one is at some point"
4671440,4677120," I was talking about how we've reordered more screwdrivers and someone basically was like, after the"
4677120,4683440," failure of the backpack and screwdriver, how could he possibly be ordering it? Okay, come outside your"
4683440,4689440," your little bubble that you live inside for two seconds. Or like, would you even be willing to"
4689440,4697440," consider that I am a just marginally rational being for a moment and that I wouldn't throw good money"
4697440,4703840," after bad. If I'm ordering more, okay, if we're working on Lux backpack, if we're working on new"
4703840,4711520," colorways of the screwdriver, if that's happening, could you not consider a reason other than me being"
4711520,4718800," phenomenally stupid that I might be ordering more of them, right? Like, I'll write if it, sorry,"
4718800,4724480," I actually worded that wrong. Maybe I am phenomenally stupid, but it was probably successful, right?"
4724480,4730880," Otherwise, I would be phenomenally stupid to be ordering more. So if your brain can't handle any"
4730880,4736960," reality where I am not just spectacularly dumb and these were a failure, maybe the problem is you."
4736960,4744320," And it's the same for looking at stuff like this, like, uh, yeah, a lot of experts do work at"
4744320,4750080," SpaceX and they've done a lot of stuff that's quite frankly just mind-bending game-changing."
4750080,4757760," Yeah, utter failure lttstore.com says hb curb over on twitch orders more failed products that"
4757760,4763120," mysteriously sell out. It's probably a conspiracy. I'm probably hiding those products in a warehouse"
4763120,4767280," somewhere, just shoveling them in there so that I can pretend they're sold out so that I can order"
4767280,4773440," more. Apparently there was, yeah, I have, there's, I don't know if this is legit at all. I'm not even"
4773440,4777920," going to show it, but there's, there's a van and it shows it getting hit by what looks like some"
4777920,4781440," flying house or something. Yeah, no, apparently it was parked there to record the launch and they"
4781440,4785440," knew the risk. Yeah, and that is real. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Chat was talking about that a fair bit"
4785440,4788800," before. Well, okay. I mean, if that's the case, then it sounds good because yeah, when like,"
4788800,4793280," if you go to watch these things, you have to be really far. That's still damage for sure."
4793280,4798320," So it definitely still wasn't just the rocket. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."
4798320,4802320," That's the only point for sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I never thought it"
4802320,4809600," was just the rocket. Um, but yeah, really, really, really cool to see. I'm excited, like, no time"
4809600,4815120," since the launch to actually like look into it because I've just been very busy, but I'm excited"
4815120,4819920," to look into it more. Um, and I've heard lots of really cool things and I want to see more of it."
4819920,4824640," I watched like just the little like, you know, three, four minute clip. Yeah. And that was"
4824640,4829280," awesome. So I'm excited to watch more. Nemsie and float playing chess as these guys clearly"
4829280,4833760," don't understand the concept of a whale or how many you have. It's not actually the whales that"
4833760,4840800," drive the store success. Like we have what I could totally see a whale buying 50,000 screwdrivers."
4840800,4846880," Why not? That's not how that works. Like we have stats and there are people whose lifetime spend"
4846880,4856160," is very high because like as much of their wardrobe is LTT store as mine is, but there's only so"
4856160,4862720," many shirts you can buy. Yeah. Like there's a limit, right? You can't go full like, um, you know,"
4862720,4868640," I'm trying to think like candy crush, you whale on this rise of kingdoms or whatever the mobile"
4868640,4872320," games are called. What's, what's that cringe one that everyone's mad at people for taking"
4872320,4878000," sponsorship money from? Not Clash of Plans, uh, great shadow legends, right? Like we're not"
4878000,4882560," talking about people spending tens of thousands of dollars on LTT store.com. You can only use so"
4882560,4888160," many screwdrivers at once. Uh, no, we actually just really did sell over a hundred thousand screw"
4888160,4892080," drivers. I think we're up to about a hundred, twenty five hundred and thirty thousand now."
4892080,4897120," We're moving. We removed the counter, but I mean, I'm all about transparency guys. So we're still"
4897120,4906160," moving on average about two hundred to two hundred and fifty a day. It's wildly successful. And no,"
4906160,4911280," it's not because we have somehow bamboozled people into buying it. There's just one person."
4911280,4915840," It just takes them that long to add two hundred fifty to the cart. It's just, it's telling you"
4915840,4922080," man. It's just, it's just one way, one whale runs a whole store. Okay. Yeah. Oh, yeah. How do you"
4922080,4927760," think everything releases successful? Yeah. I mean, it's got to be just that one."
4927760,4934000," It's not because they're good products. It's just one big whale. Yeah. Any, any opposition I've"
4934000,4939760," had to anything that Elon Musk has done is actually just a big smoke screen because we're BFFs and he"
4939760,4945200," orders everything off of LTT store.com just as a personal favor. Yeah. Yeah. And then I, I've got"
4945200,4950400," to kind of run interference on this whole thing. That's where my like 40 chess theories about him"
4950400,4955360," trying to offload Twitter while he secretly turns it into the everything app. But people won't see"
4955360,4959920," it coming because I'm out here talking about how he's actually trying to get rid of it. And then"
4959920,4964480," the values going to go up and the shares are going to be worth so much. It's a, it's a brilliant plan."
4964480,4972240," We should probably talk about Twitter. Oh, what? Not much. What part? Well, I lost my check mark."
4972240,4973200," What did they do? Oh,"
4976640,4983120," to be clear, neither was ever had personal ones. I was, I was actually so far ahead of the curve"
4983120,4988400," on this one. It's not often, look, I'm, I'm going to, I'm going to take this W where I can"
4988400,4995920," because it is so rare that I am ahead of the trend. Okay. I was already too cool for a blue"
4995920,5001120," check mark. We had one on the corporate account and that was really important because it reduces"
5001120,5006480," impersonation. Well, that's really the main reason. It reduces impersonation. Yeah. We don't,"
5006480,5012400," want a situation where people are getting scammed. Twitter seemed to care about that before. So they"
5012400,5019280," would verify notable personalities and companies. And we treated that account as our, as our corporate"
5019280,5025920," account. And we, we continue to its atline is tech. But once I handed Linus tech, which was my"
5025920,5031280," personal account before, once I handed it over to Linus Media Group Inc. And then started my personal"
5031280,5037120," Twitter, which is at Linus G. Sebastian. I even once they opened up Twitter verification to anyone"
5037120,5047040," who applied for it, as long as you verified your identity, I was like, no, no, I'm going to be,"
5047040,5055440," I'm going to be verified by my follower count. And by my irreverence here on everything that I am"
5055440,5060240," tweeting at people. And if you don't know that that's actually me, that I guess you just don't know,"
5060240,5066240," guess you guess you're not in the know. So I am just as unverified as I was before,"
5066240,5072240," but slightly less irreverent because I haven't really posted that much. I came out of semi retirement"
5072240,5078880," to mock someone who suggested that I couldn't afford the $8 a month for a blue tick. And I was like,"
5078880,5089200," let me tell you, $8 a month, utterly meaningless in the context of Linus Media Group's operations"
5089200,5096320," here. If we don't have a blue check market, it's because I decide not to. It also isn't $8 for the"
5096320,5103200," company, right? So it depends. It depends what you're trying to do. I forget how the like $1,000"
5103200,5106960," a month one works. I haven't really looked into it that much because frankly, I don't care."
5106960,5111200," A free speech platform where you have to pay to be heard is not a free speech platform. That's"
5111200,5115440," simply not how that works. What is what is he called again? I don't sound square. No, no, no,"
5115440,5123600," no. The like form of he's like free speech, but not free. I don't know. Anything you have to pay"
5123600,5128320," for is not free because it doesn't apply to the people who can't pay for it. So it's. Well, he had"
5128320,5132480," a term for it because like you could still tweet. You just don't get the promotion or whatever."
5132480,5137600," Oh, right. Which is exactly what Twitter was accused of doing in the past, which is a fact."
5137600,5141920," No, I'm not trying to defend it. He just he had like a word for it or a phrase for it or something."
5141920,5146560," I don't know what it was. It was the kind of thing that if you believe it, then free speech paid reach."
5146560,5152640," Yeah, I think that's it. Then you I don't know, I guess freedom of speech. No, freedom of reach."
5152640,5156080," There you go. Sure. Anyways, moving on."
5156080,5162240," Anyways, Twitter sucks. No, I want to talk about our plan. We have a plan for Twitter. Yeah."
5162240,5169600," Okay. So depending on how things go over the next little while with Twitter, it could be that,"
5169600,5174320," you know, we continue to engage on there the way that we always have. It could be that,"
5174320,5179680," you know, it ends up not being not making as much sense. Like if the audience dwindles, then,"
5179680,5184320," you know, we might we might not continue. But whatever ends up happening over on Twitter,"
5184320,5188800," I think what we're going to do is we're going to lean hard into YouTube community."
5188800,5196160," Yeah, like the the reach is better. It engages more directly with our core audience,"
5196160,5202640," which is on YouTube. Yeah. On the on the occasional times that we have posted what we put on Twitter,"
5202640,5208880," which is usually just like kind of sh*t-sting and stuff like that, it's been received extremely"
5208880,5213280," well in YouTube community posts. I will also say for the for the float plane people, if you're not"
5213280,5217760," already on the beta site, I would suggest doing it because it's like way more awesome and stuff."
5217760,5222480," But we another you might have noticed a lot of little features coming out over the last few weeks,"
5222480,5227040," another one of those that we're planning, which is very close to being ready,"
5227040,5232160," is configurable notifications for sub channels. So you might already see if you're subscribed"
5232160,5237200," to Linus Tech Tips that well, that's a collapsed sidebar too. But but you can see how there's like"
5237200,5242000," all the right, sorry, the air like the bottom working on I'm a I'm a working on it. There we go."
5242000,5247120," You can you can manually collapse it, but there's one little update now where click the little arrow."
5248880,5253040," So you can you can expand and collapse that without re navigating where you are."
5253040,5259440," Oh, okay. Oh, cool. Okay. So yeah, so that that changed like literally today. But we're going to"
5259440,5263840," have another sub channel for these like social posts or community posts or whatever they are."
5263840,5268320," We just don't want to add it right now because right now you wouldn't be able to turn the notifications"
5268320,5273040," off for just that. Right. And if you're if you have notifications on for everything that Linus"
5273040,5277760," Tech Tips offers and LMG clips, which is going to be added, it'll be a little overwhelming. And social"
5277760,5281280," posts and everything else is going to be very overwhelming. So we're waiting to add some of those"
5281280,5284800," until this feature comes in, which is like literally right around the corner. And then you'll be able"
5284800,5288800," to manually configure notifications reach sub channel, however you want. And then we'll have all"
5288800,5293440," those types of things on here as well. So you won't be you won't be left out. We've got some"
5293440,5298640," some good extras on float plane right now, by the way. This is an early access video that's coming up"
5298640,5305280," this weekend. What happened? Nope. This is an early access video that's coming up this weekend."
5305920,5310960," Sports branded tech products are a pretty bad deal. I just watched the intro. It's great."
5310960,5314640," It's really good. Okay, we can show the intro. Oh, you don't have to. Yeah. Okay."
5314640,5318800," Nope. No sound."
5318800,5324400," Between the pipes was great."
5324400,5328160," And then just immediate."
5332640,5337440," It's so relatable because the second you pulled those onto screen, I had the same reaction. I was"
5337440,5342960," like, Oh, what are those? You know what? That's actually part of our intro laws. We've been working"
5342960,5349600," on how to write better intros lately with the writing team. And one of the laws is that the first"
5349600,5355600," 20 seconds has to contain something that makes it broadly relatable. Because no matter what it is,"
5355600,5363600," whether it's a 25 year old voodoo brick, say, for example, oh my, that's actually pretty cool."
5363600,5371440," Whether it's something like that, or whether it's a brand new graphics card just released $1600,"
5371440,5378240," we have to find some way to make it relatable. So with the voodoo brick, say hypothetically,"
5378240,5383120," if we were going to make a video about that, a way to make it relatable might be to tie it into"
5383120,5391120," the evolution of multi GPU technology over the years, where it came from, what it became,"
5391120,5397040," where we think it's going, because multi GPU is not gone. And it's coming back stronger than"
5397040,5400720," ever, mark my words. And we make a really strong argument for that in the video."
5400720,5401280," Interesting."
5401280,5409760," Yeah. Anyway, or with the $1600 GPU, I mean, most people will never own that. That's not"
5409760,5416080," opinion. That's a fact. Most people will never own that GPU. But how can we make that more"
5416080,5421440," broadly relatable? Well, we can talk about how the performance and the features that we're seeing"
5421440,5426960," here first, and are excited about here first, are going to make their way down to lower price points"
5426960,5433440," until, you know, whether it's two or three or five years down the line, it will be attainable"
5433440,5438800," to most people. And really us covering this card is us just showing it to you early. You could"
5438800,5444000," think of it that way. So I think that's, you know, the angle that we would take if we were to make"
5444000,5450560," a video about micro LED technology, which I am also really hoping to do soon. But nothing's,"
5450560,5455440," nothing's actually locked in on that. Right. The last thing I had wanted to show you guys over"
5455440,5460560," on float plane is that we've got a really great series of exclusives going on right now. This"
5460560,5466000," one's called their first time. I enjoy those. Those are Nick and Colton react to their first"
5466000,5472320," times on camera. Really cool. We've got extras from the working for LMG. So these are full,"
5472320,5476480," I believe uncut. I haven't watched them because I'm not allowed. But I believe they're uncut"
5476480,5480800," interviews from that video. So you guys can can watch through those if you want if you're over"
5480800,5487280," on float plane platforms. That's another that's another popular punching bag for haters is how"
5487280,5491760," much we suck. Oh, yeah. And how bad float plane is there's like there's a post on Reddit right now"
5491760,5495840," with like 1500 upvotes or something like that about how awful float plane is and how"
5495840,5501760," we're failures and whatever it's like. You can actually do the math. There's some,"
5501760,5507760," I mean, there is some fair criticisms in there. Absolutely. For sure. However, one of the criticisms"
5507760,5510880," could have been dealt with if they had just clicked the link in the video description,"
5510880,5514960," which does take them to the page that has the pricing and has the content on it. So we actually"
5514960,5520560," realized that there is an issue with that. So that is completely true. But if you view it on a"
5520560,5525920," mobile phone, so not in the app, but on a mobile phone, it collapses it and you can't see the pricing."
5525920,5532240," So we're like, oh, so we'll we'll fix it. So shout out. We will fix that. But it is not a failure."
5532240,5538800," And that's not just, you know, Huffing copium. It is actually not a failure because it actually"
5538800,5545360," generates millions of dollars a year in revenue, which is more than what most of the haters have"
5545360,5550400," done. So yeah, like we know the front page sucks. We do other stuff. We will make the front page"
5550400,5554800," better. And at least lately, we've been showing off new features often enough that people actually"
5554800,5559680," believe us that we're working on other shows. Yeah, that's nice. We really were working on the"
5559680,5566000," other stuff before it wasn't really showable. It's hard. It is now. I really like that. I know"
5566000,5572720," we literally just talked about it. But okay, so the little arrow that you guys saw next to the"
5572720,5578160," channel where you could expand and contract the sub channels, that used to be attached to clicking"
5578160,5584080," the channel at all. And and Jaden got it in today so that you can just click the arrow separately."
5584080,5588480," And now it's like a fidget toy for me. I just sit here and expand and contract and expand."
5588480,5592480," All the time. I don't know. We're going to keep. We're going to keep working on quality of life"
5592480,5597200," features. This is a really cool just message. I happen to be looking at float plane chat."
5597200,5602480," TJ Ford, 10 11 says I've been experimenting with using AI tools to assist with building"
5602480,5608080," customer websites faster. Is that something I should disclose to the customer?"
5608080,5617280," Oh, does a carpenter have to say what brand of saw they used? Yeah, I don't think so. Unless"
5617280,5626880," if you are using anything private that you are giving to this AI tool and it is a externally"
5626880,5632880," ran tool, that could be like a data privacy issue. So if you're using like if you're feeding it"
5632880,5638000," customer data or you're feeding it things that are covered under an NDA or a non or any other"
5638000,5644240," do you need to be very careful about that. But if you're just using a better hammer than you have"
5644240,5648480," a guy, whatever, if you're like, Oh, I need to make some button that does something and I want"
5648480,5651760," you to help me do it and it helps you do it. Like, who cares? You don't have to disclose. That's the"
5651760,5656560," way I see it. That would actually be like weird to disclose in my opinion. Like if your contractor"
5656560,5674820," was like, by the way, just I use a mcl"
5674820,5685520," Yeah, but you do care about our sponsors. The show is brought to you today by Vessie. Do you"
5685520,5694080," enjoy wet feet? Well, I don't. I enjoy Vessie. Vessie says their shoes 100% waterproof puddles."

5732480,5738160," than our parking lot and the benches next to our building. That was where that other shot was from."
5740080,5744400," I mean, we're in Vancouver. Look, we don't have to go far to get rainy puddles."

5871600,5874560," Live laugh. Okay."
5874560,5879280," Merch messages. There's also three of them. Okay, Dan, hit me."
5879280,5886320," Okay, let's see. Sorry, you got to give me some time in between these. You put the"
5886320,5892240," yeah, you're the one who put it there. I know I'm new at this. It's a new system. All right,"
5892240,5898640," a couple of merch messages. You're new. Yeah, I am. Luke got him. How do you handle having your"
5898640,5903840," boss also be your landlord? I am beginning to have problems crop up because of this"
5903840,5911520," like being held to different standards than my coworkers. Oh, interesting. Be better. No, I,"
5911520,5921840," wow, toxic. I don't know. I mean, are you sure that's what's happening? Or is this"
5921840,5927680," something that your brain is just running with? I mean, it could be. It might also be"
5927680,5930960," happening. I'm not saying it's not, but like."
5930960,5937520," Because like I could see that power dynamic making the boss slash landlord feel like they"
5937520,5942800," could push this person harder knowing that there's no escape from them. That could absolutely happen."
5942800,5949200," There's also a level of shared frustrations. Yeah. Where like if they're if not taking care of"
5949200,5952800," the lawn when that was explicitly part of the deal for their low rent, for example,"
5954720,5958240," which generates complaints from the neighbors. How could you?"
5958240,5964480," That could that could bleed into, you know, shared frustrations at work and stuff. Yeah, it could."
5964480,5977440," But yeah, I don't know. So that's that's it could be totally legit, but I do think you need to"
5977440,5982320," evaluate the situation, make sure that you're not making it a thing that it isn't at the same time."
5982320,5986480," Because that is a relatively common thing in these types of dynamics where you feel like"
5986480,5991360," you're being persecuted for something when you might not be. And I'd always recommend talking to"
5991360,5997680," people start with an I statement. I know it's like cringe or whatever high school counselor stuff,"
5997680,6003600," but start with I feel and get it out there. Because if you don't get it out there,"
6003600,6007840," you can't expect it to magically resolve itself. Even if they're doing this on purpose."
6008560,6013200," Hey, at least it's good to know and be the closer, right? Be open to the idea that you don't really"
6013200,6019440," have the whole story. So like, let them explain their side of it as well and hope that they'll be"
6019440,6023280," open to hearing your side as well, because that's what it takes to have a functional relationship."
6023280,6028000," I'm assuming you're relatively close to this person considering they are your boss and landlord."
6028000,6032080," So the fact that they agreed to both or you agreed to both or something is probably not just"
6032080,6036320," changed. There was probably an okay relationship at some point, I would guess. Yeah, so you can"
6036320,6042000," probably get a master work at like Foxconn or something. You're like living in there like on site"
6042000,6046800," dormitories or whatever. We're assuming that this is like a Western arrangement."
6046800,6051440," Yes, that's fair. All right, what's next? Okay, next up, Houdi, LTT. My friends have"
6051440,6056400," discovered that each of us makes a dismissive comment or gesture whenever they want to switch"
6056400,6062160," topics. I eat, wow, that's crazy or just a head shake. Can y'all call each other out?"
6064960,6070160," I think both Luke and I are direct enough to just say, all righty then, moving on."
6070160,6076880," Just change the topic of conversation. Yeah, I think our tell is telling the other person that"
6076880,6083680," we want to move on. Yeah, and our whole generation basically treats the emoji,"
6083680,6090240," the single emoji as punctuation for the conversation. I think that's pretty well understood."
6091440,6096320," Yeah, if you don't, I think reacting to it because modern messaging systems"
6096320,6100160," reacts. Yeah, I guess that's the new one. That's less of a thing a bit. Oh, okay."
6100160,6105360," I think if you send a whole message that is just like a thumbs up emoji, it's like, yeah, this is"
6105360,6112000," over. If you send just a react, I might interpret it that way, but I might also be wondering if"
6112000,6116000," you're going to do that and then send a message in response. I'm just trying to find like some"
6116000,6124000," some examples of us just, okay, LOL. That's a good conversation termination."
6124000,6128560," But that might not be like a, I want to stop talking about this now and that might just be a,"
6128560,6131520," I don't really have anything to add. No, because I have perfect examples here."
6131520,6141200," Okay, so we were talking about the Valentine's party with AIs. Yeah. And then I basically go,"
6141200,6145040," yeah, so the party just took place with them interacting with each other. My brain is broken."
6145600,6151040," Then I sent thinking of streaming today, but kind of feeling a social and posted a picture of my,"
6151040,6155440," my bike painting thing. And then you said, you don't have to stream painting it. It could just be"
6155440,6158240," a stream and you could not interact with chat. And I said, well, I don't know what I'm doing."
6158240,6163920," I was hoping chat could help. And you say, LOL, well then. And that's the end of the conversation."
6163920,6166800," Well, see, but that's one of the situations. Hold on. I have another one."
6166800,6172480," Right before that, I messaged you and I say, oh, we were talking about the housing market."
6172480,6177600," You have that stick guy that's playing, come on, do something. And I go, well,"
6177600,6181280," I just make sure you check out a house with someone who knows a fair bit about Reynolds,"
6181280,6185600," if you can, might help recognize any corners they cut, but it'll still be impossible to say"
6185600,6191120," what they covered up or painted over. And you go, well, probably something, something, some stuff."
6191120,6196640," And I go, it doesn't hurt to keep your eye on things hurts a little. And you go, yeah, LOL."
6196640,6201760," And the conversation's over. Yeah, I think LOL is the ultimate conversation"
6201760,6205200," termination because I'm trying to terminate the conversation. I don't really have anything else"
6205200,6209200," to add. Right. But that's terminating the conversation. Yeah, fair enough. Yeah."
6209200,6215520," But it's not like, I think what he's saying is they are like done with this conversation and want"
6215520,6220800," to move on. Well, I don't know. I think maybe it's maybe it's Austin's own perception of the"
6220800,6227440," dismissiveness. Like to me, Luke's not being dismissive. He's just done talking about it."
6227440,6231920," And that's OK. Yeah. Like, I'm OK with that. I guess you got to be secure in"
6231920,6236880," being able to acknowledge that what you're talking about ain't that interesting."
6236880,6240880," Or there's just, yeah, just nothing else to add necessarily. Yeah. You know what? Oh, man."
6240880,6246160," So that kind of makes me think about how you and I used to complain about Wancho topics before."
6246160,6250960," When people would go, wow, this is really interesting. And they'd put it in the Wancho dock."
6250960,6257040," And we'd go, this is not, it's interesting, but it is not a topic of conversation. It's like,"
6257040,6264640," a statement. Yeah. It's not. It's a thing. But there's no real room to discuss it."
6264640,6270240," And so maybe you need to recognize that sometimes you think something is a topic of conversation."
6270240,6278240," Like, OK, I'd say parents are the classic thinking something is a topic of conversation when"
6278240,6283360," actually it's just a boring statement that no one cares about. You know, Timmy took his first"
6283360,6291920," steps today. Yeah. OK. Cool. Hey, look at this funny thing Timmy said on video."
6291920,6301360," Law. That's not my kid. I don't give a **** right? Like it's no, I know I'm serious."
6301360,6308800," Like I value a human. I assign value to a human life. I do. Yeah. That particular one"
6309360,6313680," is not any more or less interesting to me. You have like a ton of interaction with that one in"
6313680,6319680," particular. Sure. Then maybe. Yeah. But I'm talking the stereotypical parent who has just never met"
6319680,6329440," this person's kid. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. No. I'm not a psychopath. I just I just don't have"
6329440,6334080," a connection to all eight. It's definitely eight billion or however many people there are on the"
6334080,6340400," earth. It's definitely a thing. Being a psychopath. No. Oh, no, no, no. I thought it was being a"
6340400,6347360," sociopath. I mean, no, that's OK. So no, no, it's also not being a sociopath. Like I said,"
6347360,6354640," I do assign value to human life. I do have emotions. I just don't I just I don't have the emotional"
6354640,6361760," bandwidth to be that invested in more than a handful of lives. I have not a lot of friends,"
6361760,6367200," but the ones that I have are extremely close and extremely dear. And I just don't have the"
6367200,6372400," brain space. I mean, maybe this is just an ADHD thing at a certain point because I can only pay"
6372400,6376560," attention to something. I think it's also very normal though. And I think a lot of people that"
6376560,6382560," would go against what you're saying in public settings might not actually feel against it inside."
6382560,6388240," Right. So I'm just saying the quiet part out loud. I think a little bit. Yeah. I think that I"
6388240,6394400," think so. Yeah. So I'm going to keep doing my laws. I don't consider it dismissive. I just"
6394400,6398480," consider it's not you're not terminating the conversation. It's not anything to add. Yeah."
6398480,6404400," Oh my God. Every now that I'm aware of it, every time we talk, you end the conversation with all."
6404400,6413760," This is three in a freaking row here. Oh, I ended one with a JFC. Okay. Yeah, which is I'd say an"
6413760,6419120," equally just it's essentially a reaction. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But there's often things will say to"
6419120,6422560," each other, share with each other that like there isn't necessarily a conversation to be had."
6422560,6426480," Yeah. And we're like honestly, like honestly, I'm busy right now and I don't have time to sit and"
6426480,6431120," text with you for 20 minutes. Yeah. I saw this. Yeah. See you later. That's all it really needs."
6431120,6435440," Yeah. I don't know. It'll take us however much time with it you want. I don't really care."
6435440,6441360," Dan, I'm lost. Oh, there's no sign. I don't know what to do. You only did two. I don't know how to"
6441360,6446560," oh, this show. Well, then it's the sign should still be there. He's going to put the sign back here."
6446560,6448880," We can watch him. No, we're going to watch him put the sign back."
6448880,6458240," So mad. There it is. All right. There's your sign. Again. Hi, Luke."
6458240,6466800," Did I broadcast conversations over? Forget it. Okay. Next message. Hi, Luke. I'm currently a"
6466800,6471120," networking class and I know that you guys have touched on this before, but I was wondering"
6471120,6476720," what are some of the larger costs of video streaming and why are those costs so high?"
6476720,6482000," Bandwidth. Bandwidth is rough. Yeah, but why? That's what they want to know."
6482000,6490400," Who do you pay for bandwidth? Because they charge a lot. I don't know. You have to pay for transit"
6490400,6495760," across networks that other entities own is a big part of it. Yeah. And then like having good"
6495760,6505440," routes. So routes is like you might have a server who's like negotiated route to your house is"
6505440,6509440," fantastic. So if you watch a video, it's great, but the person down the street,"
6509440,6514320," you think it wouldn't be that different, but they might be on a different ISP. And the"
6514320,6520160," negotiated routes in your country might be poor for that. So like companies like YouTube"
6520800,6526800," have fantastic distribution everywhere with really, really great routes to basically everyone,"
6526800,6533920," but that's not that simple. Right. So like we do a bunch of our video distribution through"
6533920,6539200," Cloudflare. One of the reasons why we do that is because Cloudflare has very, very good global"
6539200,6543840," coverage all over the place. We have this float VPN thing we've talked about before, because we"
6543840,6548080," always like having fallbacks. That's part of Flowplane's whole thing. So we can fall back to"
6548080,6552560," our own setup whenever we want, but to be able to get the amount of coverage to the amount of routes"
6552560,6556080," that we would have with Cloudflare, the scale that we would have to go to would be kind of crazy."
6556080,6560400," It wouldn't make sense. By the way, is this broken? Kyle R's thing here is stuck here."
6560400,6564240," He's holding it there because that's a question we're doing that. We're doing a broad"
6564240,6569520," catch and then also pauses the queue so that other merge messages aren't getting lost. That's"
6569520,6574640," why you have the giant circle. I think that was entirely Conrad's idea. It's really useful."
6574640,6581680," Cool. Cool. It's pretty sweet. But yeah, so there's all these routes problems, but you would think,"
6581680,6584960," you would think, and this is where it gets expensive and also complicated,"
6584960,6588240," where with Cloudflare, they're one of the biggest internet companies there is."
6588240,6593360," Yeah, ever. We should have perfect coverage like everywhere. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, yeah. Why don't we?"
6593360,6599520," Nope. Oh. Because even Cloudflare doesn't have perfect coverage to everywhere. There's certain"
6600160,6606080," places in Australia, surprise, surprise that have issues. We've notoriously had some issues in"
6606080,6610880," Germany. Certain routing problems in Germany. We just have lots of problems with it. Even when"
6610880,6617520," we're trying to feed through one of the biggest multi-billion dollar data distribution companies"
6617520,6624080," in the world, we still have problems there. We can work on ourselves. We can set up new"
6624080,6629600," partnerships. We can try to expand our partnership map, do a multi-CDN thing so that if quality to"
6629600,6633280," somewhere is low, we switch over to some other CDN. All of a sudden, there's many significant"
6633280,6638400," events. Ransy asks, I assumed you'd use Akamai for streaming. And I believe we can. We can. Yeah. But"
6638400,6645200," we have a lot of costs agreements and other stuff. We have float plane CDN, but then we also have"
6645200,6652800," fallbacks to cheap CDNs and also expensive CDNs. And we can actually dynamically choose which one"
6652800,6657680," to use to deliver the content depending on what's most favorable for the particular user. We don't"
6657680,6662560," always get it 100% right, but the team tries really hard. Akamai is extremely expensive."
6662560,6668160," It's really, really good, very high quality, but very expensive. So we want to avoid that"
6668160,6673360," whenever we can, but we'll do it if we have to. Yeah. Hey, that's one more time. Okay, well,"
6673360,6678400," now we're going to move on to some potentials. So we've got a lot of the rapid fire to go through."
6678400,6683920," Oh, okay. We can do some rapid fires. Sure. Yes, we have about 20 to do. We should have a timer"
6683920,6688400," for rapid fires. That would actually be a good prop. That'd be cool. I'll make a note of that."
6688400,6695680," Okay. My wife and I are not gamers, but we do have a laptop with a mobile 2080 and 32 gigs of RAM,"
6695680,6700480," as well as two Logitech controllers. Of course you do. What are some games we can play together"
6700480,6707120," that aren't too expensive play. It takes two. Classic. Hi, everyone. I've been trying to"
6707120,6712480," get portals also. Overcooked. Overcooked is great. Yeah. Overcooked is super casual."
6712480,6717760," Hey, we should talk about that game we played at the retreat."
6717760,6725760," Mage quit. Mage quit. Mage quit is so much fun. If you and seven friends want just like a chaotic"
6725760,6732320," arena brawler, don't practice. Don't don't like train up because you'll be way too OP."
6732960,6737200," And it actually won't be fun. Yeah, go in all of you cold and it'll be like"
6737200,6742720," the most fun you've had gaming in at least six months, I promise. I haven't I haven't like"
6742720,6747520," bounced around and cheered that much for a game in a very long time. Probably since the"
6747520,6751200," whale land, to be completely honest. Because that's what that's what it's all about. Yeah."
6751200,6757920," Even playing field upsets. Anyone could win it. And like it was so much fun, especially at like"
6757920,6762400," one of my favorite moments was really early on when we like still nobody had any idea what they're"
6762400,6768560," doing. And you see two people who it's like everybody else is knocked out or dead or whatever it is"
6768560,6772400," in that game. There's two of them left. Clearly neither of them knows what they're doing, but"
6772400,6777600," they're like fumbling around trying to figure it out and they're whipping and just you see them"
6777600,6781440," whiff and something blows up on them all. We don't know how one of the abilities works yet. So we"
6781440,6785840," think they can avoid it, but they actually can't. So we're all like to avoid it and they get obliterated."
6785840,6791520," Man, it was it was very fun. There's no like we have never talked to them. There's no agreement or"
6791520,6796960," anything. We just a bunch of us played it. Yeah. And it was very. Yeah, we had an exec retreat."
6796960,6805040," And I was I I think wisely packed eight controllers. It was pretty sweet. The ROG ally, an external"
6805040,6811760," GPU and a long HDMI cable. And I was like, if all else goes to absolute at least we can place"
6811760,6818560," we can play some video games during the night. And it was a good call. I knew because I'm very"
6818560,6825360," wise and a good leader. No, but seriously, I I gambled that the best thing to do would be to find a"
6825360,6830400," game that nobody had played. So I just was digging around trying to find eight player local multiplayer"
6830400,6835360," games, which is shockingly hard to do in the new Steam Big Picture interface valve. Come on."
6835360,6841520," It was it's unbrozable. Go ahead. Go try. Go try to browse local multiplayer. You you actually"
6841520,6846320," more than eight more than four players, like accessing custom tags. And we feel really"
6846320,6851200," difficult. Some of them was like, okay, it's four players locally. You can connect for other"
6851200,6856480," players, but they have to be like, yeah, general client, so what made made quit actually worked"
6856480,6863200," with seven people local eight, eight people. Sorry. Yeah. So yeah, so I was like, yeah, this will be"
6863200,6866880," this will be the activity. And I was like, yes, it was awesome. It was and the steam room was great"
6866880,6871840," too, actually, or sauna rather. I guess it's more of a sauna. Okay, sorry, hit us again. That was"
6871840,6875760," not that rapid fire. We'll do better. That's good. Good answer. Hi, everyone. I've been trying to"
6875760,6880560," properly engineer my water loop, but struggle to find data such as head loss and heat load for"
6880560,6886560," radiators easily. Will this be something the labs could test? Probably not, because it's not"
6886560,6894000," really like a fixed function equation. Your tolerance for the temperatures of your devices"
6894000,6902400," could allow you to run a lower cooling capacity radiator and still be comfortable with it. So,"
6902400,6908560," say for example, you were comfortable with your devices running at 90 degrees on water. Well,"
6908560,6916080," good news for you, you can use a small radiator with slow fans and you're good to go. It just means"
6916080,6923680," that your water, your coolant temperature will be higher, which is going to make it less effective"
6923680,6929920," at pulling heat off of your CPU or your GPU. The good thing about that is the hotter the water gets,"
6929920,6936720," the more effective the heat exchanges with the air. So, you might be a different kind of user who"
6936720,6943040," wants to see 65 degree load temperatures with super low RPM fans as well, in which case I'm"
6943040,6947040," going to tell you, okay, well, you're going to need probably about eight to 10 120 millimeter"
6947040,6954080," rads. So let's go. Yeah, it really, it really just depends. It depends on your on your on your"
6954080,6960640," tolerance. I would say that the general rule of thumb used to be a single 120 millimeter per"
6960640,6966720," heat generating component. So if you had three CPU and two GPUs, you'd want a triple 120 mill,"
6966720,6972720," I would say that's probably out the window these days. And it's more like a 140 millimeter per"
6972720,6978160," heat generating component or about one and a half 120s per heat generating component."
6978160,6983200," And then if you have lower tolerance for noise, then you're going to want to go a little heavier"
6983200,6985760," than that. Yeah. As for the pump, get a d5."
6985760,6993520," That's the answer. Lang d5 or some rebrand of it. Someone did clarify. Apparently,"
6993520,6998400," mage fight goes up to 10. Mage quit. Mage quit goes up to 10 local players. Oh, well, that's great."
6998400,7003360," I only write a controller. So I didn't think to check that. But if our exact team grows and or"
7003360,7007200," everyone is able to make it next time, we're ready to go. Let's play some mage quit. Nobody"
7007200,7012000," better practice because that would be totally in dumb swear. I will not play because yeah, the"
7012960,7018640," it's more fun to have no idea what we're doing. Yeah. I mean, everyone's struggling in the same"
7018640,7024160," way. It was a big part of the entertainment. There's a game I'm really excited to play at LTX."
7024160,7031040," It was actually indie dev by one of my old colleagues at NCI X. Do you remember Tom?"
7031040,7036000," Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So probably looks really cool. Tom made a game. Did he actually like dev"
7036000,7040160," it or did he do all the art? I think so. Well, I mean, I don't know. Cool. I mean, he, I think"
7040160,7044720," he said he did. Maybe he lied. Maybe it's AI. But I'm not going to ask him to show me what kind of"
7044720,7051200," hammer you used. Good reverential. Let's see the next one. Anyway, I played it for about two minutes"
7051200,7057360," just to kind of make sure that it functioned enough to. But and I'm not going to touch it again."
7057360,7063280," And then we'll we'll have some fun with it. Nice. Yeah, I'm excited. What's your best tech-related"
7063280,7069280," dad joke? I can never do this on the spot. Yeah. You can't do a dad joke on the spot. That is not"
7069280,7075360," a dad joke. Yeah, they just question denied. Well, moving on. Hey, Linus, have you ever considered"
7075360,7080000," making a slim version of the LTT backpack for someone that typically carries a lighter load"
7080000,7086800," of accessories and likes a backpack instead of a laptop bag? Yes, Yvonne's been daily driving"
7086800,7090960," our current prototype. And I think we're really close to getting the comfort nailed down,"
7090960,7095200," after which we're going to have to get another prototype that actually has all the pockets and"
7095200,7100320," zippers and everything on it because versus really bad. It's just blank. It's just the shell because"
7100320,7105600," we're trying to nail down the strap positioning. So it doesn't have a handle on the top. And the"
7105600,7110560," number of times I've interacted with it personally or watched someone else interact with it and go"
7110560,7117040," for the handle and it's just not there has been high larias. But we're getting close. It's going"
7117040,7122400," to it's going to actually be not that different in terms of total capacity. If you load it up"
7122400,7127120," compared to the existing one, it'll be less. But it's not as much less as it looks because we"
7127120,7134320," move the water bottle holder to the outside. Yeah, but it's more we're trying to make it fit on the"
7134320,7139520," the marias and the Ivans of the world. Maria is one of our one of our other staffers here."
7139520,7145520," I'm currently pursuing a major in electrical engineering, microelectronics, and graduate in"
7145520,7150560," three to four years. Do you think Intel would hire someone like me? I don't know. I should I"
7150560,7155360," should hope you've looked into that before entering that program. I think the best way to do that"
7155360,7160480," would Google would be Googling Intel jobs. Yeah, and Intel hires all kinds of people. Yes,"
7160480,7165040," like you could you could have a marketing, you know, whatever, and they would probably I'm sure"
7165040,7171280," there's a position there somewhere. I mean, you could be the world's most overqualified janitor"
7171280,7178080," at Intel. I'm, you know, there you go. Hi, uncle Linus. If you could have any games remastered with"
7178080,7183280," the kind of graphics shown in the first clip you did at the start of the show, what game would it be?"
7183280,7188640," Also 10 hour wandshow, please. Okay, first of all, no."
7188640,7198400," We should do at LTX. We should just turn wandshow into like us gaming at whale land."
7198400,7207200," I have some stuff that would allow that to happen. What about like a man, I'm trying to I'm trying"
7207200,7211920," to think I'm trying to come up with a good answer. But the one that jumps into my head is I'd love to"
7211920,7219360," play like an ano game where you can really zoom in to like a photo realistic world with AI generated"
7219360,7224800," people that are going around like for no reason other than just digital sightseeing almost like"
7224800,7230480," some kind of builder game with that level of photo realism would be kind of would be kind of cool"
7230480,7234720," to me. I know that's probably not what you were asking. I like the answer. It's interesting."
7235680,7239120," I just immediately went to like. Yeah, he did."
7239120,7245520," Because of course he did. All right. Yeah, we can carry on. We all know his answer."
7245520,7251520," What are your thoughts on someone bringing their steam deck to whale land?"
7251520,7256640," I would expect them to. It happened to last whale land. And the steam deck ended up being an"
7256640,7264080," unnatural advantage in one of our competitions that they slayed. It turns out that 3D cadet table,"
7264720,7273440," the the the the Windows XP pinball game has been ported to Linux and runs so much better on the"
7273440,7278240," steam deck than it does on Windows now at much higher frame rates and not to mention that this"
7278240,7283360," is much more natural than whatever it is that you're doing with a keyboard. So they absolutely"
7283360,7288160," slayed the next the next runner up by playing on their steam deck and we were like, well,"
7288160,7292400," well, I guess I have to accept it. He got the score wasn't outside of the rules. Nope."
7293680,7298720," You're all workaholics, but what make for creative things do you enjoy doing when you have free"
7298720,7314880," time painting fiber arts doodling? I think that for me, um, well, okay, fine. I was talking about my"
7314880,7321280," paint booth earlier. I am planning to paint my bike. So I haven't actually fired up the sprayer"
7321280,7328400," yet, although I will this weekend, um, somehow got roped into I volunteered to help James paint his"
7328400,7332720," walls because I have experience with that and I knew that I would be able to help him do a much"
7332720,7340240," better job with even just a few hours of setting him up for it. And somehow I got roped into helping"
7340240,7347680," James paint his kitchen cabinets, which is not something that I am super experienced at or in"
7347680,7353760," fact, even have ever done before, but I do have the equipment for it. So we're going to be muddling"
7353760,7358160," our way through it together, which will be fun. But the real reason that I have this spray equipment"
7358160,7363120," is so that I can do up my motorbike in this color scheme. So that's not actually that's like a mock"
7363120,7368720," up. Yeah, Maria did this up for me and, um, I contracted her out of hours to just kind of mock"
7368720,7373920," this up for me because I'm lazy and don't feel like figuring out how to do it. Um, so that's"
7373920,7378160," something I'm planning to do. So I guess that's kind of what you're asking. I like fixing stuff."
7378160,7384640," I don't know if that really counts. Yeah. I'm not like super knowledgeable or good at doing it,"
7384640,7391280," but I enjoy it. I don't know why, but over the years, I remember being"
7391280,7398800," colossally disappointed many times by how not handy you were with what? Well, see, I grew up on"
7398800,7404880," a hobby farm and I know that your dad's like super handy. And so there would be just things"
7404880,7409920," that I would take for granted that you would just know how to do like paint a thing. Nope. And you'd"
7409920,7416240," just be like to quote Yahtzee, it'd be like watching a cat try to fly a kite like you just"
7416240,7423840," incapable and I didn't understand it. My dad stupid. You just you know the story. My dad."
7423840,7431440," Like so my dad was around a ton. Yeah. When I was like quite young. But when I was in like my"
7431440,7436080," teens, when you do a lot of this type of stuff. Yeah. They're really long story, but he had to"
7436080,7441040," he didn't have to, but he stepped up and got a bunch of jobs and stuff and was like,"
7441040,7448160," it wasn't absent father because he was around. Yeah. But the time that he was around would be like,"
7448720,7455680," oh, I have two hours between my jobs. Let's like hang out for a ball. Like, or like,"
7455680,7460320," I probably like too tired. Right. Okay. But like, how about you throw the ball? I'll watch."
7460320,7463040," And then a lot of times there's something needed to be done. He wouldn't have that much time. So"
7463040,7467280," he would just like do it. So I could observe, but I often wasn't doing it myself. Yeah."
7467280,7472480," But I mean, since then he's like, show me more things and stuff. Right. But yeah."
7472480,7479600," Yeah. See, I don't know. Like I just I was not by choice, but I was very often dragged into things."
7479600,7485200," So I just just know all kinds of things. I've done a bunch of like distributed labor tasks,"
7485200,7490800," but not things like paint this thing. Like we, we reroofed my parents house. Right. So like,"
7490800,7494480," I've done roofing. Sure. I think I did a pretty good job of that. Yeah. So like,"
7494480,7498720," quite different actually. I've done roofing interior exterior. And I'm not talking like"
7498720,7505280," professionally. So like some roofing interior, exterior painting. I've, you know, treated infections"
7505280,7513920," on horses feet, cared for livestock, you know, built out buildings, like repaired, gravel,"
7513920,7520960," you know, driveway, you know, buried that fawn that the dog killed, operated an excavator. Like,"
7520960,7528000," I just like, there's just so much, you know, Doug fence posts, both by by digging them, pouring"
7528000,7533680," concrete and embedding them also by post pounding. Like there's just on a farm, even if it's not a"
7533680,7538800," for profit farm, there's just a lot of stuff to do. There's so much to do. It's utterly never"
7538800,7544640," ending. See, like I've gone to because I grew up out there, but we didn't have one. So I've gone to"
7544640,7549360," like friends houses and helped them with stuff that they had to do. But there's a big difference."
7549360,7556080," Yeah. Like my friends didn't work really helpful when we were like, you know, loading the barn with"
7556080,7560880," hay. Right. Like they were, they'd kind of do a couple and then they'd get bored and they'd wander"
7560880,7566560," off and I get it. I didn't get bored. You probably would believe that to be. Yeah. Yeah. You probably"
7566560,7572720," would have been a lot more helpful than my friends were. But like, I mean, I still didn't live there."
7572720,7577920," So it wasn't a constant. People are asking repair, gravel, driveway. What is that? So you don't,"
7577920,7583760," you don't just lay down gravel. So potholes develop. And then the way that you put it down,"
7583760,7589440," you just have to kind of get a feel for how much of it to shovel and wheelbarrow out and how much"
7589440,7594480," to fill it so that when it settles, it'll actually be smooth when you, when you drive up it, like just"
7594480,7598960," gravel drive, gravel, man, our driveway was so friggin long. It was over 100 meters long and the"
7598960,7604160," incline was like this. So like getting out of there in the snow and stuff was brutal. I had to,"
7604160,7609680," I had to, I had to often run because I was usually late up to my bus stop uphill both ways, of course."
7610480,7617120," I hated that driveway curse, curse that driveway. If you guys want to see it, it doesn't really matter."
7617120,7621040," Here's the, here's the place where I grew up."
7621040,7629760," Well, grew up after 11. So I lived in Ladner until, until then. Here we go."
7629760,7637440," There. This is my parents' hobby farmer, at least what it looks like now. So this used to be a"
7637440,7643840," riding ring for horses. There's ponds here. It's kind of hard to make out. This is, this is all"
7643840,7648800," my parents' former property. They don't, they don't have any more."
7648800,7650560," Not now. Don't like show up."
7650560,7657200," And we're not, like, we were not crazy wealthy. My parents were teachers. This land was empty"
7657200,7663680," when they got it. It was a big stretch for them to get it. And it was basically like worthless."
7663680,7668240," Compared to now, it's probably worth a fortune. Like, estates out here are totally a thing."
7668240,7672960," You can see, like other people with their fancy paved driveways and whatnot. Yeah, we didn't"
7672960,7675280," have anything like that. In fact, oh, is this paved now?"
7675280,7676160," I think so."
7676160,7682000," Looks like it might be, it might be paved now. Also, many, many of these buildings, whether it's"
7682000,7686720," the, the pump house is hidden over here, were actually built by my parents themselves."
7686720,7690560," All of this was just like dirt and blackberries. It looks like a lot of landscaping has been"
7690560,7696640," done since we lived here. See, my dad, like, my dad built this, like, that garage that's in our"
7696640,7702320," backyard. Yeah. Like, he built that. But I was like too young at that point to be able to contribute"
7702320,7707280," much. He also did this, like, custom solar panel array for our pool."
7707280,7708160," Chicken coops gone."
7708160,7710240," But I was also not very useful at that time."
7710240,7711440," Barnstellaire."
7711440,7715040," A lot of stuff was either I was too young or I was already now out of the house."
7715040,7720160," And like, the gap where I would be useful at, like, contributing and also learning things was,"
7720160,7724160," he was very busy. It was just unfortunate timing. But he's, he's definitely gone out of his way to"
7724160,7731040," educate since then. Fun fact, if that place is ever on the market and you're into high quality"
7731040,7736960," drinking water, it has a drilled well that by luck, we managed to hit some kind of underground"
7736960,7742960," spring or something. And it has the best drinking water I have ever encountered in my life and"
7742960,7748800," never runs dry. It's like the highlight of that property for me and probably something that"
7748800,7750560," wouldn't even show up on a real estate brochure."
7750560,7758480," I like, honestly, I spent my childhood bathing in water that people would pay like $6 for a"
7758480,7762240," little bottle of and it would still taste like crap because it's been in a plastic bottle."
7762240,7768160," Obviously. Plastic bottles. Yay. Anywho."
7768160,7773680," Oh, more topics. And I'm signed out of Google Docs because why wouldn't I be?"
7773680,7774320," Luke, head to me."
7775440,7780400," Reddit to charge for its API. This is actually very interesting. It's more companies than just Reddit."
7780400,7786080," Reddit has announced it will be charging businesses to use its API. No direct motive was given for"
7786080,7791760," the changes. Cough, cough. But data scraped from Reddit is known to be a major component of several"
7791760,7797280," prominent AI training databases. Likewise, Reddit is planning to go public later this year and could"
7797280,7803200," use future income from AI development as a draw for investors. The announcement stated that the"
7803200,7808400," changes were directed at in quotes, third parties who require additional capabilities,"
7808400,7814320," higher usage limits, and broader usage rights. End quote. And I and will take effect following"
7814320,7819920," a 60 day notice period. While Reddit claims to want to keep its API accessible to developers that"
7819920,7825200," improve the Reddit experience, the vagueness of the announcement caused concern among developers of"
7825200,7831280," third party Reddit applications. CEO Steve Huffman described the company's authentic conversations"
7831280,7837040," as particularly valuable to LLM's saying in quotes, there's a lot of stuff on the site that you'd"
7837040,7844800," only ever say in a vowel in in therapy or a or alcoholics anonymous or never at all. And that is"
7844800,7850720," a surprisingly transparent truth. Yeah, discussion question refreshing actually out of the honest."
7850720,7856240," Reddit is full of incredibly intimate conversations. Is it right to use them for AI development?"
7856240,7861840," Is it right to sell them? Well, when you post it on the site, you kind of. I'm pretty sure that's"
7861840,7866640," even just in the terms of services. Yeah, you give it to the site. If it's if it's posted publicly,"
7866640,7870880," that's that's public. That's the thing that happened. You know, when when I was all outraged"
7870880,7876000," about companies using private data, I was talking about private data earlier. I wasn't talking about"
7876000,7880000," public data. If they were doing this with like PMs on Reddit. Yeah, that's a whole other ball of"
7880000,7884560," wax, which I mean, wouldn't necessarily surprise me. But that would be different though."
7885360,7891600," Stack Overflow too. That's that's the really crazy one, in my opinion. Stack Overflow is"
7891600,7898000," talking about the same thing. Oh, really? Yeah. There's a lockdown is is happening. I mean,"
7898000,7902880," we've even been talking about it. You know, how are we going to publish information on LTTLabs.com"
7902880,7908240," in a way that is not going to just train the machine learning large language models that are"
7908240,7913200," going to replace any need to navigate to our site? We've been trying to figure out how to slow down"
7913200,7920640," AI and capitalism gave us the answer. I think this might literally be it. If these companies"
7920640,7929600," slap down expensive enough API agreements, yeah, like Reddit and Stack Overflow, just those two"
7929600,7937600," things. It's such a huge portion of these training models. Absolutely enormous. And what's really"
7937600,7943840," interesting is some companies are basing functions of their company around chat GPT already."
7943840,7950720," And the tools that came from chat GPT. So if those suddenly get worse, because of stuff like this,"
7950720,7957040," that'd be very interesting, very interesting indeed. But yeah, I think that's really all there"
7957040,7960880," is to say on the topic, to be honest, there are other companies that are doing this. I know"
7960880,7965440," Stack Overflow and Reddit, there are other ones as well. But yeah."
7966800,7971120," As someone asked if I would consider purchasing my childhood home to keep it in the family. No."
7971120,7975680," It's fine. The house is a house to me. I mean, my family is my family and the house is just the"
7975680,7980160," house. But Arjun from the social team said, Hey, just heard you on the WAN show, there will be a"
7980160,7984720," short behind the scenes of the Weg hoodie photoshoot. Oh, sweet. Currently editing it. Cool. There you go."
7984720,7991280," The answer there. Good job. All right. Amazon offers louder dialogue. Okay, dialogue boosting."
7991280,7995600," Yeah, it's just like, so you don't have to buy a sound bar, I guess. Oh, it's an accessibility"
7995600,7999200," feature, but probably has a broader audience considering how many TV viewers report using"
7999200,8004560," subtitles most or all of the time. And this is probably more consequential for the industry."
8004560,8012720," Samsung is considering switching to Bing. Oh, yeah. Yeah. So this is why Google is actually"
8012720,8018960," so upset, man. I sent an email earlier today. And I remember just being it didn't matter."
8018960,8025280," Right. It didn't matter at all. Because it didn't change the meaning of what I was saying"
8026240,8033920," in any way. But it just it just irritated me because it's so utterly unnecessary. Okay,"
8033920,8039360," read this bottom email. I think everything's here. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Here, read this bottom"
8039360,8044800," email. Just just read it out. Oh, thanks for letting me know would love to get an update from"
8044800,8049200," them when that's resolved so I can use it. I found some alternatives, but none that I particularly"
8049200,8062000," trust. Why is trust capitalized? Why? I find the way that I type on my phone if I'm going really"
8062000,8070720," I didn't type. I dictated it. Oh, chat GPT wouldn't have made that mistake. Yeah. Why did it capitalize"
8070720,8076960," trust? Yeah, I didn't I didn't bother to correct it. It didn't matter. It didn't change the"
8076960,8084960," meaning of what I was saying. But it's just no wonder Google is in freakout mode right now."
8084960,8088800," Yeah, because they've sat here. They sat on their, they sat here. Super long time."
8088800,8097280," Complacently not making basic things like like calling by voice or dictate proper capitalization"
8097280,8104320," and punctuation while dictating. And their competition has come up and created GPT four."
8104320,8110480," They found a way to instead of try to keep biting, just leap ahead. One of the problems with this"
8110480,8115520," is the previous topic though. This is literally what I was saying as part of the previous topic."
8115520,8122320," Certain companies are hitching up with chat GPT and being like, okay, this is tons of efficiency"
8122320,8127280," or it's better for whatever reason. We are going to move in this direction. And that could bite"
8127280,8132960," them in the butt. If certain, you know, if certain things happen and maybe the data set can't be"
8132960,8139600," used anymore or maybe open eye needs to start paying way more money to be able to access these"
8139600,8142000," things so they have to increase their fees, whatever else. It's not going to help Google."
8142000,8147680," Oh, no. So it's just, it's interesting. Samsung is in negotiations with Microsoft to switch the"
8147680,8153840," default search engine on its devices from Google to Bing. Just for context, in case you didn't know,"
8153840,8159920," the default search for basically everything ever is Google and Samsung sells a heck of a lot of"
8159920,8165920," phones. When news on the potential deal became public, it led to a sharp fall in Google stock"
8165920,8172880," and reports of panic within Google search division. Google reportedly pays up to $3.5 billion"
8172880,8179920," dollars every year for its position as default search on Samsung devices, as well as $20 billion"
8179920,8186240," for Apple devices. Samsung has switched to Bing before back in 2010 for some Galaxy models."
8186240,8190560," However, this could also simply be a negotiation tactic on their part."
8190560,8198800," I've heard there's Scuttlebutt that Apple is also looking to either switch to Bing or at least"
8198800,8205840," leverage Bing's newfound relevance to renegotiate with Google. These are multi-billion dollars a"
8205840,8211280," year. Oh, you did mention the Apple one. Okay, cool. This is really funny. On the subject of auto"
8211280,8218640," completion, second IT guy in floatplane chat says, \"I never mean to say the word duck.\""
8218640,8229280," Spoken like an iPhone user. All right, Netflix ends. I didn't even know they were still doing this."
8229280,8238880," Netflix has ended their DVD mail service. This September, Netflix will be finally ending its 25"
8238880,8245360," year old DVD mail service, which brought in 145.7 million in revenue last year."
8245360,8252720," That's a lot more than I thought. The DVD division had a dedicated fan base among users"
8252720,8257520," without consistent Internet access, as well as those who preferred its broader selection of"
8257520,8263120," more obscure titles, many of which are not widely available on most or any streaming service."
8263120,8269760," But the DVD division has slowly shrunk over time. It once posted a selection of over 100,000 titles,"
8269760,8274560," while now it's unclear exactly how many titles the Netflix streaming service carries,"
8274560,8278880," but its US library carries around 6,000 titles, similar to what was carried by a single blockbuster"
8278880,8283920," video location at the chain's peak. Our discussion question, what should happen to Netflix's DVD"
8283920,8289120," collection, and what alternatives are there for people looking for unusual titles or low cost"
8289120,8294400," physical media? Well, what should happen to their DVD collection? I really hope they don't just"
8294400,8298240," recycle them. That would suck. Maybe if they just left them with the last person who rented"
8298240,8303200," them? Like, I don't know. Like honestly, I'd rather they not just end up in the footage."
8303200,8306080," Keep the service going for a while, but you just don't have to return it anymore."
8306080,8308960," Yeah, that'd be kind of chill. That'd be super cool."
8308960,8312480," For people looking for, man, what alternatives?"
8312480,8315360," Do I say it?"
8318000,8323280," Like, what do you want from me? If rights holders won't make their media available,"
8323280,8328400," at that point, I mean, that's down to your own personal moral compass, right? Like,"
8328400,8337280," if you want to watch it, like, why is someone standing in your way? Why do you, why tolerate that?"
8337280,8339200," Privateering. I didn't say it."
8342240,8347520," It's been one more popular. If it is, if it is available by legal means, of course, you know, you,"
8347520,8355760," it's how creators are compensated. But if it is not available by legal means,"
8355760,8359600," it's not like you could compensate the creator by buying it. If you can't buy it."
8359600,8364960," What do you want from me, right? It's, it's very interesting to me that, like, honestly,"
8364960,8370080," three years ago, people didn't really talk about piracy that much."
8370080,8371680," Oh, yeah, it was kind of dead. Yeah."
8371680,8374720," Spotify Netflix. It's like, yeah, steam."
8374720,8376880," You had pretty good solutions for everything."
8376880,8379520," It's the golden age of not having to pirate content."
8379520,8382800," And now, like, Nintendo's doing the things that Nintendo does."
8382800,8383680," Oh, yeah, that's classic."
8383680,8387200," And stuff like this keeps happening, and people's cost of living is going up,"
8387200,8391520," and their wages are not matching it. And also, like, this perfect storm is coming back for"
8391520,8396560," people to put the hats back on. It's really, it's, it's interesting to me that the industry is,"
8396560,8397920," like, allowing this to happen."
8398560,8401440," And then they don't see what's happening. Yeah."
8401440,8404000," Instead, it's like, oh, well, we'll, we'll just hike the rates."
8404000,8404480," Yeah."
8404480,8407040," Well, no, actually, that's not a response."
8407040,8407280," Yeah."
8407280,8410000," I mean, Disney seems to be kind of waking up a little bit."
8410000,8415360," Apparently, they are going to be loosening the restrictions that they've put on licensing"
8415360,8420880," their own IP to third-party services because they figured out what a gigantic hit to their"
8420880,8426320," bottom line it was. Like, Disney Plus, while it has generated, like, 100 and however many"
8426320,8431120," million subscribers is not a huge W for them compared to staying."
8431120,8432080," There's too many services."
8432080,8436080," Staying focused on what they do best, which is apparently run theme parks these days,"
8436080,8443200," and creating content and licensing it to a wide variety of providers all over the world."
8443200,8449280," Like, it just, it's like, yeah, duh, we had a good thing. Everything was working."
8449280,8452080," And now, yeah, guys, you had, you had done goofed it up."
8452080,8458080," I'm not going to subscribe to Disney Plus and Prime Video and Netflix and whatever HBO's"
8458080,8462880," thing is called now. What's it called? Just Max now? I can't even remember. I can't keep track."
8462880,8463600," They keep changing."
8463600,8466000," All the different services. I can't even keep track of them."
8466000,8468960," There are certain things that do make sense to me on a separate service."
8468960,8472880," I don't want to pay for sports ball. I don't need it. I don't care. I don't have time to follow"
8472880,8477760," it. I shouldn't say I don't care. I actually do sort of peripherally pay attention to what's"
8477760,8484640," going on. I kind of know who's favorites to win the NBA Super Bowl or the... I'm kidding."
8484640,8493840," Or the Stanley Bowl or whatever. I do that. I do it on purpose. I do kind of know who the"
8493840,8498640," major players are. And most of that is just so that I can have conversations with people. It's like,"
8498640,8504000," oh, LeBron's the all-time leading scorer now. We can talk about that a little bit and how that's"
8504000,8508400," super cool or whatever. But I don't have time to watch the game. So I don't want to pay"
8508400,8513440," for the broadcasting rights that whoever I'm giving money to has to pay in order to have"
8513440,8528560," cameras in the stadiums. But if it's TV shows, I can't. People are upset. People are upset about"
8528560,8533920," my sports ball stuff. Formula football. Yeah, I like it. It's good. Someone doesn't like the thing"
8533920,8539520," that I like. This is hilarious. Sink plane on float plane. Great username, I think."
8539520,8544880," Didn't they change from HBO because it makes people think softcore porn when they hear it?"
8544880,8552000," Not necessarily that, but apparently, yeah, they changed the branding because it makes people"
8552000,8558960," think of very adult content. And they want to do more, it's Warner Media who owns them now."
8558960,8565680," So that's where you're going to get this new Harry Potter television series that frankly"
8565680,8571600," feels very unnecessary. I'm not even going to wade into the controversy around the author."
8571600,8577120," I want no part of any of that. Isn't that media's whole thing right now? It's like"
8577120,8582560," resurrecting dead series and just making it bad. I mean, I guess like that's a that's a pretty"
8582560,8587360," consistent trend. I'm not surprised it's happening. It's just it's happening to everything. How do"
8587360,8592080," we ruin this? But there's talks about remaking Princess Bride if you want it to be more on the"
8592080,8599840," nose. Okay, hold on a second though. Princess Bride came out in like 1984. 88, whatever it can't."
8599840,8605200," It's old. Yeah, it's old. It's at least old. Harry Potter's body isn't even cold yet."
8606640,8612400," Literally. For real though. The actor is like still like young. Yeah, you know,"
8612400,8620080," I just I meant I just I can't. Yeah. Oh, oh yeah. Twilight is apparently also getting a TV series."
8620080,8624080," Yeah, you don't want to talk things that are unnecessary. But no, the thing about the Harry"
8624080,8630160," Potter one that feels particularly unnecessary is that they were good. They were already good."
8630160,8635680," Twilight. I mean, at least you could make the argument that maybe they could make it better this"
8635680,8641600," time. Probably not though. Rough. Yeah."
8641600,8653360," Another topic? Sure. NYPD at semi autonomous robots. I mean,"
8653360,8659200," do we really have to say much other than that? Oh, good. They have thermal cameras, two way audio,"
8659200,8665440," can patrol a pre-programmed path. Followed them. Yeah, not yet. Apparently, that's probably good."
8665520,8673120," Yeah, it's a matter of time. And the Red Cross wants gamers to stop committing war crimes,"
8673120,8681520," which sounds kind of stupid on the surface, but actually kind of makes sense to me. I know this is"
8681520,8689040," this is probably me with a with a hot take here. But yeah, for real, I mean, we don't accept, say,"
8689040,8697760," for example, video game depictions of extreme sexual violence. So why is it that we have this"
8697760,8703440," tolerance for here are some of the things that the Red Cross outlined as in violation of the rules"
8703440,8709440," of war and that are classified as war crimes. First thing. So that is shooting combatants while"
8709440,8716720," they are downed and cannot respond targeting noncombatants. So nonhostile NPCs targeting civilian"
8716720,8722640," buildings. The Red Cross apparently even partnered with Let's Players to stream V."
8722640,8728320," I thought this was actually very cool. With the purpose of the campaign seeming to be to raise"
8728320,8734560," awareness of the rules of war. And it's a pretty great message because I didn't watch any of it"
8734560,8738400," because I don't really watch streams. But I saw some of the titles and I thought it was really smart,"
8738400,8746400," fun, fun little challenge to do. I think gamers are never going to care about these rules"
8746400,8751840," as long as they are detrimental to gameplay. And right now they would be detrimental to gameplay."
8751840,8757680," But here's a question for you is a genuine mechanic in a lot of battle royale games right now."
8757680,8763360," Sure. But then is there not an argument to be made that you should be considered to be out of"
8763360,8770400," the round if you are incapacitated? No, that's like it would take game developers to make this a"
8770400,8775760," thing. I even really like the give medical aid to anyone in need friend or foe. Very interesting."
8775760,8783760," Making a mechanic where you or your team receive some form of benefit for administering medical aid"
8783760,8792400," to a downed foe and it then makes them respawn or something as the mechanic. But then you gain"
8792400,8796400," like extra points or something is super interesting because you would have to be administering it."
8796400,8802480," So it takes you out of the game for a second as well. But like you could make it fun and make it"
8802480,8809680," not a worker anymore. But it's possible in my opinion. Yeah, I think it's totally possible."
8809680,8817760," Yeah, I think watching some of the streams, like if you're into watching streams could be fun though."
8817760,8824560," I personally enjoy inflicting custom rules in games because it makes it very fun."
8824560,8827120," It's fun to watch other people do that as well. So maybe check some of it out."
8827120,8833520," And now it's time to check out when show after dark. Are you guys enjoying the more structured"
8833520,8838160," sort of show format that we have now? Let us know. Let us know in the comments."
8838160,8842720," Can you even tell? Yeah, can you even tell that we changed anything? So Dan's got kind of"
8842720,8848000," guidelines for how long we should do some topics and then when we should explain"
8848000,8854320," merge messages when we should talk about what's new on LTT store this week. And then the idea is"
8854320,8861840," to have the main sort of tech discussion be a little bit less encumbered by talking about LTT"
8861840,8867040," store or merge messages or whatever else. So we kind of get through it in the early part of the"
8867040,8871120," show. So people who only care about that only have to watch. I think we've been live for about two"
8871120,8877120," hours, something like that. And then while still allowing us to address the vast majority of the"
8877120,8881360," merge messages that come in or at least at least a good number of them, I don't know if we're going"
8881360,8889360," to get to all of them this week, you guys went absolutely. Weigh Nana's for the Weigh hoodie. I"
8889360,8893600," yeah, couldn't have estimated that we were going to move this many of a dog sweater."
8893600,8902320," But hey, you know, I'm here for it. It was it was a passion. It was a passion project. A labor of"
8902320,8907680," love from the from the merge team was not something we expected to be a big profit center. And it"
8907680,8914240," still won't be at that price, but like whatever. It's fun. You got to have fun. All right, Dan."
8914240,8917520," Okay, we're going to go right into curated. You guys can go through some of the potentials"
8917520,8921760," and respond by a text if you want or curate them. If you want something good. Luke, are you going"
8921760,8927520," top to bottom or bottom to top? I'm currently on top or a bottom. I'm currently on top. And"
8927520,8934080," you're a power regardless, right? He has strong typing power. Oh my."
8934080,8940800," For first hearing. There's your current message. Kyle asks."
8940800,8946640," Hi, Luke. I'm currently in a networking class and I know that you got this one."
8946640,8951120," But why is it still there then? Get wrecked. That's my fault. This is from Christopher."
8951120,8956720," You talk about wanting to expand LTT store into becoming a more mainstream product producer"
8956720,8962160," or whatever the terminology is. My question is, would you consider sponsoring professional athletes?"
8962160,8976400," Yes. But not in the ways that you probably think. Sorry, I'm just finishing. Okay, it's"
8976400,8985600," really hard to multitask typing the thing. Oh, did you archive it already? Yeah. Oh, okay."
8985600,8988640," Do you want to sponsor athletes? Okay, that's okay. I can read it there."
8988640,8996160," Yeah, I would. But the reason that we would sponsor an athlete would be to"
8996160,9002480," account like to overcome a perceived deficiency in funding for a sport that I'm particularly"
9002480,9008880," passionate about. So, for example, we actually did do a sponsorship deal for this year with a"
9008880,9016000," local badminton club. They're called ClearOne. And we sponsored their team. But what I made"
9016000,9021600," really clear to the club owner was that I don't actually really care about my brand on the jersey."
9021600,9027280," Quite frankly, from a marketing perspective, my reach is a lot greater than theirs. I don't"
9027280,9032960," need the logo on the jersey. It doesn't matter. He wanted to do it, I think, because sometimes it"
9032960,9039920," can look good to have good partners. And so, he really wanted our logo on the jersey. But I kind"
9039920,9045200," of went, yeah, that doesn't matter to me at all. What mattered to me was that his plan for the"
9045200,9052400," funding was to use it for after-school programs to kind of jumpstart after-school programs"
9052400,9059200," outside of Richmond, where badminton is really popular, and into other parts of the lower mainland"
9059200,9063920," so that they could provide coaching time to kids that otherwise would never pick up a racket."
9063920,9072480," So, that I was really interested in. But just sponsoring an athlete, other than as a vanity"
9072480,9076880," project, doesn't really have a ton of value to our brand from a business standpoint. That doesn't"
9076880,9080880," mean that I never make an emotional decision. I just mean that I have to look at it objectively"
9080880,9086800," first before succumbing to my emotions. So, with that in mind, as a vanity project, would we ever"
9086800,9092560," consider sponsoring an athlete? Yeah, sure. The sport that I happen to be passionate about is"
9092560,9101600," badminton, and it is woefully underfunded in Canada. I want to say 2016, was that a summer"
9101600,9108640," Olympics? I think it was the 2016 Summer Olympics. It had literally zero dollars of funding. So,"
9108640,9114160," the athletes that managed to get there had to do it all by the straps of their own boots,"
9114160,9120160," and that's absolutely ridiculous. So, that's the kind of thing that I could get behind. Like,"
9120160,9123760," we wouldn't go after the biggest in the space, but if it was someone who otherwise just wouldn't"
9123760,9129040," get a chance to compete, that's something that we'd consider. Okay, next up, I prepared for a"
9129040,9133040," lot of applications. This one's from... It's not something we're doing right now."
9133040,9138240," Badminton funding is all tied up in opening our own center, which is hopefully coming late this year."
9138240,9143200," Everything funding is sort of currently tied up. It's just, he's saying it's maybe something,"
9143200,9147360," maybe one day we could consider. We've already had a bunch of people ask, by the way."
9147360,9152000," Really? Not right now. I mean, historically. Oh, okay. I didn't even know about that. Yeah,"
9152000,9156800," that's a good thing. Hey, Dan, hit me. With the rise of direct storage and games needing SSDs,"
9156800,9163680," would using Primocache to cache the most used data on hard drive or slower SSD be a good alternative,"
9163680,9169040," or could it interfere with DS making it skip cache? That's actually a really good question,"
9169040,9174880," and I think that it is possible that a solution like Primocache could interfere with the proper"
9174880,9179840," functioning of direct storage. Obviously, I haven't tested it yet because I'm being asked this question"
9179840,9187760," for the first time right now. But if direct storage thinks it's operating off solid state media,"
9187760,9192560," which it doesn't necessarily have to, so the latest direct storage update actually"
9192560,9198960," has a provision for directly streaming assets off of a hard drive. It's up to the developer"
9198960,9203600," whether to use that or not. And I would hope that most developers would try to use direct storage"
9203600,9210640," properly. And we can just all move into the solid state era together. But hey, if you have it as a"
9210640,9215360," fallback, I could see that being really valuable for people who aren't ready or able to move to"
9215360,9222640," solid state yet. But I would think that regardless of that, confusing direct storage and making it"
9222640,9227760," think it's pulling off solid state when actually it's a solid state cached hard drive could be a"
9227760,9234000," problem. And I wouldn't want to do that because the whole point of direct storage is that we are"
9234000,9240560," eliminating extra hops in communication and pulling data directly off of devices, expecting"
9240560,9245200," it at a certain speed. If it's coming in slower, I think it would probably result in gameplay anomalies."
9245200,9255840," Hi, Luke. How does float plane handle technical debt? And is there anything you've learned from"
9255840,9258160," these challenges that you can apply at LMG?"
9258160,9271520," Apply at LMG. Not really. Because it depends on how you define float plane, I guess,"
9271520,9275600," because float plane, the company does a lot more stuff than float plane, the website."
9275600,9282720," Technical debt in regards to float plane, the website is a problem we've had for sure."
9283520,9287680," There was a long time there where for various reasons that I'm not going to go into because"
9287680,9292560," it would take an extremely long time to talk about all of it, we were chasing features a little"
9292560,9298080," bit harder than we probably should have been. And that resulted in quite a considerable amount of"
9298080,9303760," tech debt that we're we currently over we overcame a fair amount of it recently in order to release"
9303760,9310400," this beta site, which hopefully very soon we'll be just actually be the main site. But there's more"
9310400,9314960," work to be done. And we're going to be doing that for a pretty considerable amount of the rest of"
9314960,9322480," the year, solving a lot of those problems. But ideally, I try to do, you know, 10% time on maintenance"
9322480,9327600," to avoid it. We couldn't do that for a long time, which is why we are where we are. Tech debt is like"
9327600,9333600," not doing proper maintenance or falling behind on on versions or revisions of different pieces of"
9333600,9338560," software or services that you use, or not keeping up with different frameworks that you should be"
9338560,9343440," using. Like maybe you're using one that gets basically deprecated, if not actually deprecated,"
9343440,9347280," like maybe the original developers are like, Oh, we're still working on it. Just that you only"
9347280,9358960," ever see commits like once a year or something. Yeah. Okay, I saw Colton at my local mall the"
9358960,9363920," other week. I wasn't sure if I should approach him. It made me think what is the typical etiquette"
9363920,9370640," expectations for those less in the limelight that work at LMG? Good question. Those less in"
9370640,9374560," the limelight. Why don't you answer it? Was it our etiquette? I wasn't sure if he was talking"
9374560,9381920," about himself. Yeah, himself. I don't really know. I've been trying to work through that in my own"
9381920,9390160," head. It's awkward, I guess. I would like to assume that most people would appreciate the"
9390160,9397440," interaction, but probably just don't take forever. Yeah. I think that's the big one is sometimes"
9397440,9401200," people will approach you and they'll say, Hey, I don't want to take any of your time. And then they"
9401200,9404400," will proceed to take a bunch of your time and show you pictures of their cats and pictures of"
9404400,9410000," their computers. And it's like, that's fine, but there's a time and a place for it. And that time"
9410000,9417120," and place is at an officially sanctioned meetup. So I'll see you at LTX. Right now, I'm meeting"
9417120,9422400," with my family and I'm paying attention to them and not you. And I'm not working because that's the"
9422400,9429920," thing is as much as I'm, you know, actually just am so blessed, right, to have this community that"
9429920,9435920," has rallied around us. And it's like the coolest thing ever. This is my job. And like, I'm at work"
9435920,9443920," when I'm doing that. Sometimes I can choose to do it on my own personal time. But in the mall,"
9443920,9449200," I didn't. That wasn't my choice. Right. That was that was your choice. I wasn't in control. So"
9449200,9456160," with that in mind, I would say that in general, your best bet is because we also don't like being"
9456160,9464080," watched surreptitiously. Right. I can tell. And just because I ignore you doesn't mean I can't tell."
9464080,9471920," So we don't like that for sure. So your best bet is, you know, that, hey, love your videos."
9472960,9478640," See you later. I would personally always rather know if you're going to be stuck in the same"
9478640,9485600," vicinity as me for a while, I would personally appreciate if you early or rather than later. Yes."
9485600,9489840," Yeah. If you acknowledge. Yeah. And if you're like, I'm feeling awkward, I don't really know"
9489840,9494400," what to say, even just the like, Hey, love your videos. Hey, love the Whan Show. Hey, love your"
9494400,9499760," thi some nails, just a head nod ends up being or just that like a Hey, I see you. Because then"
9499760,9506000," like, I don't know, I know. And that's cool. Yeah. That's I appreciate knowing personally."
9506000,9510720," And like I think at this point, it's pretty fair for someone like me or Luke to assume that we're"
9510720,9515520," being listened to in public. So we try to speak in coded language, if we need to talk about"
9515520,9520480," anything that's confidential, whether it's regarding product or the internal workings of"
9520480,9525120," I'm a speedy group or float plane or whatever else. But it's still not everyone's going to do"
9525120,9532160," it's still good for us to know, know that, you know, whatever I'm saying could be posted on Reddit"
9532160,9538240," in 30 minutes or less. And even if that's like, obviously not your intention, it's still just"
9538240,9542160," nice to know because if I end up figuring it out way later on, I'm going to feel very awkward"
9542160,9546240," and uncomfortable, like wondering. Now I have to run through everything that I just said,"
9546240,9549520," since I've been in this area or whatever else and it's, it's a little uncomfortable."
9553040,9560240," Next up, High Linus, I work at SAS company that specializes in software for the gym industry."
9560240,9564240," As you've worked towards opening your club, is there any technology that surprised you?"
9564240,9574160," Surprised? I'm very surprised at how behind the times the public address industry seems to be."
9574160,9581680," It is very much dominated by contractors, value added resellers. It's like completely"
9581680,9590400," as backwards. PA, like public address. Oh, okay. Yeah. Really? Yeah. The fact that it isn't just"
9590400,9597760," commodity inexpensive hardware and just some IP based thing that just"
9597760,9608160," this thing on it just goes is mind blowing to me. The fact that they want like subscription services"
9608160,9614080," and cloud this and whatever that like to be clear, there are situations where that would make sense."
9614080,9617840," If you're going to have 100 different zones and you're going to need like a team of three"
9617840,9621520," operators because you're at some stadium or whatever and you could be paging multiple things,"
9621520,9626800," whatever, right? Like there are situations where that makes sense. But the fact that there isn't"
9626800,9633040," just, you know, aside from just running a long cable to your karaoke machine, right? The fact"
9633040,9639760," that there isn't just kind of a basic one, at least that my contractors were able to find was mind"
9639760,9646880," blowing to me. Knaps says in float plane chat, didn't ubiquity try to get into public address?"
9646880,9652800," I don't know, but based on my experiences with their products so far, I would love for them to"
9652800,9660480," do that. They're not cheap, but they're a lot cheaper like that. I got quoted, I can't even find"
9660480,9666400," that basically I got quoted like tens of thousands of dollars for and it was like a dozen, no, maybe"
9666400,9673200," like 16 speakers or something like that and whatever. The point is it was outlandish,"
9673200,9680480," like absolutely ridiculous. These speakers were like 300 plus dollars each, even though they were"
9680480,9687440," just speakers. There was no smartness in the speaker. Blah, blah, blah, first party vendor,"
9687440,9692960," blah, blah. I don't care. I just need anything that vibrates. So I was pretty annoyed."
9692960,9701680," Sure. It was just replying to a new incoming one. All right, next up. My"
9701680,9706880," whiz smart light bulbs recently updated and a new feature they added was motion sensing."
9706880,9713440," They say it uses Wi-Fi signals to disruption, Wi-Fi signal disruption to sense movement."
9713440,9720480," How does this work and why isn't it more prevalent? I have no idea and... It would be incredibly"
9720480,9725360," hard to detect, but your... I have no idea. ...the fleshy body does interact with leaves through the"
9725360,9731840," air. So like, I don't know how the heck you would measure that. Like consistently. I understand it's"
9731840,9736560," a thing that happens, but I don't know how you detect it. Like if it's in a desk lamp, right?"
9736560,9743120," Or like a bedside lamp, how does it tell the difference between a very close cat or a"
9743120,9750400," far, a far human? I don't know. I have no idea. I mean, I believe it could be done. Yeah, I just"
9750400,9760080," don't know how you do it. It's weird. It's just weird. Okay, next up. The destroyed van that was"
9760080,9765440," hit by the concrete at the launch pad is still transmitting. It was our camera van, NASA space"
9765440,9770080," flight. We still can't go to the pad to collect it yet though. Oh, hilarious. Enjoy your tech"
9770080,9776160," set camera. Oh, so it was actually theirs. Yeah. Yeah, so it isn't external, whatever, whatever."
9776160,9781600," Well, yeah, but no one said external. They just said no other damage. Yeah, that wasn't a question."
9781600,9785600," I just thought that was fun to include. No, because I... Someone in in float plane chat,"
9785600,9790240," or Twitch chat or something, I don't remember which one, was like, oh, they claimed it wasn't..."
9790240,9794560," There was no external damage done. It's like, yeah, well, there wasn't. Then it was their own van."
9794560,9799280," Are you talking about the launch pad though, as like a damage? Yeah, yeah, sorry. They were,"
9799280,9803600," they were saying... Oh, okay. I misunderstood you earlier then. Okay. So then... All right."
9803600,9807280," Wait, what? No, I don't think you did. Yeah, I did. I think you're misunderstanding me now."
9807280,9813840," I don't think so. Okay. Because I earlier, what I thought you were saying was that someone else was"
9813840,9817520," saying that there was no damage to anything other than the rocket. That's what the dock said."
9817520,9823440," Oh. Yeah. And that's not true. Correct. Because that van was damaged. Yes."
9823440,9827840," NASA space flight's van. And the platform. Yes. Which is what I said. Then we're good? Yeah."
9828640,9835760," That's what we got there. I like it better when mom and dad fight. This is awful. Stop being so"
9835760,9842560," agreeable. All right. Next up. Highlightness. What are some crucial tips or advice for... Oh, also"
9842560,9846400," NASA space flight is a three-party group. Oh, wow. That's a very confusing name."
9846400,9852240," Okay. But cool. And I follow you on Twitter, I'm pretty sure. Neat. I thought it was official."
9853680,9857760," What are some crucial tips or advice for a new company to make a product?"
9857760,9862480," How do you go from prototype to finding a manufacturer? What are some big mistakes to avoid?"
9862480,9867600," There's so many questions today that are like six questions in one. Yeah. I try and not to."
9867600,9871920," I think what I'm going to be doing in my text responses, I've been ignoring anything past the"
9871920,9875920," first question. Okay. I think we're going to have to make it one question per merge message."
9875920,9879520," It's actually getting like, I just answered one that was like four questions. Yeah."
9880640,9885600," So some crucial tips and advice for a new company to make a product. I think the biggest one is"
9885600,9893680," don't rush. Don't launch it until it's ready because you will regret it. It's recalls are so"
9893680,9898480," much more expensive than another round of sampling. That's the bottom line. That's the"
9898480,9905120," biggest piece of advice that I can give you. And I'm not addressing the other two."
9905680,9912000," Okay. Hit me, Dan. Well, okay. Since you mentioned a keyboard and mouse is better than a controller,"
9912000,9918400," how would you prove it to a stubborn non-techy friend that doesn't understand that it is in"
9918400,9926880," cases like shooters at least? I would say that if whoever it is does not accept the"
9926880,9933680," superior control of a mouse in particular, I don't think that a keyboard is especially superior to"
9933680,9940000," an analog joystick. And all the other things that your fingers could do on some kind of controller."
9940000,9948560," But if they can't grasp the finer control that a mouse affords compared to a stick,"
9948560,9953440," there's probably just not really much that you can tell them or show them that would change"
9953440,9959040," their mind because this is no longer a rational conversation. It's an emotional conversation."
9959040,9965920," And the more you try to contradict them at that point, the deeper they're going to dig in if"
9965920,9973680," they behave like a person often does. And since this sounds like from your tone, it's a conversation"
9973680,9979280," that you've had multiple times before. I would say that if you weren't successful before,"
9979280,9982880," you're probably unlikely to be successful and it might be better to just drop the subject."
9984800,9992080," My experience that leads me to that advice is that I have been in a committed relationship for 18"
9992080,9996560," years. I'm kidding. Actually, Von's very easy to get along with and she's quite rational,"
9996560,10002880," which makes my life much better. But yeah, not much you can do about it."
10002880,10007120," I'm going to interject with one. This was in potentials from Anonymous. Just got back from"
10007120,10014080," HIMMS, a health tech con in the US. It was a lot of privacy and security experts talking about AI"
10014080,10020240," this year. They recommend siloing LLMs or building them custom for health. Any thoughts?"
10020240,10031040," Called it. This guy got him. He called it. Yeah, that's 100% going to be a thing. So there you go."
10031040,10039120," Okay. Next up. Hey, DLL. I'm a US truck driver who has been listening to the"
10039120,10044240," WAN show while I drive for a long time. What are your thoughts on self-driving semi-trucks and"
10044240,10052000," the possible impacts on jobs that were road safety? Oh my. So this is tough, right? Because I hate"
10052000,10058560," to be the bearer of bad news, but it's coming. Oh yeah. And this is another really tough conversation,"
10058560,10064400," right? Because when we talk safety, we have to talk safety from a statistical standpoint, right?"
10064960,10078080," So autonomous semis could be safer even if people die as a result of their widespread adoption,"
10078080,10082560," which is hard to wrap your brain around, right? Because what we'd like to think is that these"
10082560,10090880," autonomous vehicles could reach a level of perfection in their operation, right? But that's not realistic."
10090880,10096640," And even if they're not perfect, as long as they're better than not necessarily you,"
10096640,10102480," you might be a great driver who would never make a mistake. But as long as they're better than"
10102480,10110320," the average, the transition could make sense. And what we also know, thank you, capitalism,"
10110320,10116400," is that even if they aren't quite better than the average, companies looking to save a buck will be"
10117120,10126000," just champing at the bit to adopt them. So they're coming. Regardless of the impact on road safety"
10126000,10134000," to a degree, as for the impacts on jobs, I think both Luke and I are whatever the word is for"
10134000,10141600," people who kind of take an adapt or die stance. AI is coming for creative jobs too at this point."
10141600,10145760," Hey, I thought we had a lot more time. But we're staring it. We're staring down"
10146560,10153280," the gun barrel going, okay, well, it's act now or die. And we choose to act, right? So there's"
10153280,10158720," songs right now where people have a spoofed Drake's voice. And they're like popular and people listen"
10158720,10169600," to them. Yep. It's coming for us all. Yeah, we've got this is this is this is someone there."
10170720,10178480," Someone twitch chat there will always be an operator think trains think planes. No, there won't."
10178480,10181280," Not necessarily."
10181280,10194400," Okay, that's a scary one. Let's move on. Hey, DLL with the with it being possible to hide a"
10194400,10199920," Trojan attack in USB devices such as a drive or keyboard. Do you think there's a concern that cheap"
10199920,10205760," USB products from unknown companies could be malicious? We've got a great video coming on the"
10205760,10212480," OMG cable really spooky device. Are you familiar with that one? I recognize it, but I don't think"
10212480,10219600," so. It's basically a rubber ducky. But in the form of a completely nondescript USB cable,"
10219600,10227360," it doesn't look like it's capable of carrying any sort of payload. I just looked it up. Yeah,"
10227360,10230800," yeah, Tanner's been playing around with it over the course of this week and it's going to be a"
10230800,10236640," wild video. It's it's going to blow people's minds if they have a huge problem. Yeah, no, it's like"
10236640,10243120," really bad. Okay, so, uh, USB condoms are going to become a more of a thing now. Yeah, 100% we need"
10243120,10248160," to distribute those. Yeah, could we put the OMG cable in a USB condom and then distribute those and"
10248160,10254560," then screw people over that way? What are you even talking about? Ah, nothing is safe. Nothing is"
10254560,10261280," safe. Oh, great. I think these, I think they're devices where it just passes through power pins,"
10261280,10266400," right? Yeah. Yeah. So it doesn't allow for data transfer. So if you want to go to like a public"
10266400,10273840," spot or something like that, you can be a little bit more safe. Yeah. Okay, next up. Hey, Linus and"
10273840,10279600," Luke, if you could have one tech tip telepathically message to every person on earth in whatever"
10279600,10286320," language they understand, um, turn it off and turn it back on. Let's go."
10286320,10293520," Right. Uh, I guess if you push in new ones, it pushes them down for me."
10293520,10300320," Saving for backpack last one lasted 14 years. I'm sure the LTT one will as well. Hey, look, if"
10300320,10305600," your current car were to go kaput, what would be on your shortlist for replacement? I don't know."
10306240,10313280," But car will never die. Yeah. It's a Honda. It's a Honda. It's never going to die."
10313280,10323920," Yeah. But if it did, uh, no fault of its own. Probably. Yeah. Probably. That's probably more likely"
10323920,10332720," to be completely honest. Um, probably another one. Same age would also be mint."
10332720,10338720," Honda boy. Honda boy. Same. Yeah. Probably not the natural same generation, but I do like certain"
10338720,10346080," things about it. Um, about it, like not being a, uh, a modern car in some ways. Not having Android"
10346080,10352480," auto sucks. That part does kind of suck, but I do also just have a phone. So it's not the worst"
10352480,10360400," thing in the world. Someone said it's supposed to buy my 2020 TLX. Yeah. Yeah. That's funny. I don't"
10360400,10366080," think I'm actually going to do that. But yeah. Um, someone mentioned that they have a 2020 TLX"
10366080,10370800," in the exact color that I want, which is like the same, but modern version of mine. I'm like,"
10370800,10377440," that's kind of cool, but I don't want to do that. Um, yeah, I don't know. I, I really like"
10377440,10386640," my current car and I fit in it well. And I'm like decently tall, but I'm also just a very weird"
10387760,10392160," proportion. Yeah. He has like legs that are the same length as mine in spite of the fact that he's"
10392160,10398560," like eight inches, nine inches taller than me. Yeah. My, my torso is like, is ridiculously tall."
10398560,10403760," We have to compensate by boosting my chair. Yeah. Uh, but my legs, like my legs are actually not"
10403760,10410640," very long. My torso is just really, really long. So when I sitting in cars is like a particularly"
10410640,10416240," annoying thing for me, uh, because my head will always be in the roof. Um, there are cars that"
10416240,10421440," even with like the best I can do with setting up the seat, I have to pull the sun roof back and"
10421440,10427920," shove my head up in the sun roof so I can sit properly. Um, I'm pretty particular about like"
10427920,10436400," the fit in the car and my Acura is legitimately like pretty much the best I've ever dealt with."
10436400,10442800," So unless they've screwed that up in the many years since mine was made because mine's a 2009,"
10442800,10449840," which means it was, you know, probably made in 2008. Um, it's very, it's very possible they've"
10449840,10454400," screwed it up, but I sorted out it. They don't make actually just T.Ls anymore. They make T.L.Xs,"
10454400,10460160," which is the, the other one and T.L. merged together. So maybe they have screwed it up, but I don't"
10460160,10464080," know. We'll see. Hopefully I don't have to choose anytime soon because my car is never gonna die."
10464080,10472480," So it is what it is. We can all hope. Okay. Next up, what is your top, top tech product?"
10472480,10478000," Non-LTT and new game you can't wait for. That's another two questions. Thanks for the"
10478000,10485200," infotainment. More hot and luke warm takes, please. I'm struggling today. Honestly, my top tech"
10485200,10489520," product right now has got to be the ROG ally. I'm really excited for it. Double the performance"
10489520,10494160," of the steam deck. It's so much quieter. I can't emphasize enough how much quieter it is and how"
10494160,10502240," important that is to me. Um, I finally played stray. Hmm, it's fine. Little overhyped. But I,"
10502240,10508240," I, I, is it at least like a cool new take on a game? I enjoyed how little help it gave you. Cool."
10508240,10515600," And I don't remember the last time I really just, like I just meowed for no reason. Like I was just"
10515600,10521040," role playing a cat. Goose game? Yeah, but that was more just like,"
10521040,10528080," I was not being a goose. Is it just being a bull? It's not being a goose. I guess. Okay, sure."
10528080,10534080," Fine. That's fair. That's fair. Then other than that, like I, I was really different. I will admit"
10534080,10539760," it is different. I was, I was in my character. I played it in a combination of on the ROG ally."
10539760,10543920," And then I also played it in the theater room. I finally got my fiber optic connections running"
10543920,10549760," back to my computer. So I can play in my theater room without violating the spirit of the AMD"
10549760,10556800," challenge, which yes is still on my radar, even though it's been kind of a nothing. Yeah. Is it still"
10556800,10562320," on your radar? I'm gaming. It's been three months or something. I'm PC gaming. Okay."
10562320,10570240," It's on my radar and stray was perfect. In fact, stray was too perfect. On the ally, I'm very confused."
10570240,10575440," All of my notes for this AMD challenge are going to be worthless because there will be so many"
10575440,10580880," driver revisions from when I did my testing and you and Jake finally get around to doing yours"
10580880,10584000," that it's not even going to make any sense. You know what? No, maybe that's part of the story though."
10584560,10593520," The progression? Yeah. Maybe we just weave it in. There's always a way. We'll make it work. That's how we do."
10593520,10602320," I got distracted by incoming again. Where is my brain today? Got him."
10602320,10610560," Let's see. As a software dev manager of a hybrid, I feel my work's company pushed to get people back"
10610560,10615760," into the office is sidelining remote employees. How do you avoid the same issue, especially on the"
10615760,10621440," float plane side? Things. Well, at LMG, we called everyone back to the office. So,"
10621440,10628400," actually, we do allow some work from home. The problem is that so much of what we do"
10628400,10632720," is not work from homeable. You actually cannot operate a camera from home."
10632720,10639360," And in the interest of fairness, because you'd be amazed how petty and political things can get,"
10639360,10644080," even regarding things like which departments have, which kinds of snacks in their snack supply."
10644080,10654400," It's easier for us to have a policy that can be applied to everyone. So, work from home is on a"
10654400,10660640," pre-approval basis. Rather, it's on a per-approval basis rather than just being pre-approved."
10660640,10665360," And that's the way that we've handled it. We've always been in the office company, and so we're"
10665360,10670240," in in the office company again now that it's no longer essential from a public health emergency"
10670240,10678640," standpoint to do remote work. And the quality of the product is better. Simply put, it just is."
10678640,10687200," Full plane has the same policies before COVID that we do now. We just went back to those."
10693360,10696800," Nenhanser says, \"No adult is amazed by work pettiness.\""
10696800,10703280," The amount of drama that can be caused by a coffee machine, let me tell you."
10703280,10711600," I wish one day they'll let me touch it. No. It's theirs. I've never even seen it."
10711600,10716160," If I see another complaint generated by that coffee machine, I will personally throw it in the"
10716160,10721840," garbage. Why? Personally. Why are people complaining about a coffee machine? It doesn't matter."
10722480,10725760," If I see one, if I hear another"
10725760,10729760," complain about that coffee machine, I will throw it away. I'll do it myself."
10729760,10738240," Okay. Well, how about another merch message? Hey, Luke and Dan and maybe Linus as well."
10738240,10743920," In all of your years working at LTT, has Linus ever had an \"I'm Linus Sebastian and this is my"
10743920,10750080," company\" moment? I curated this for you because I was really curious about your response."
10750080,10754640," Yeah, it's happened. Really? Okay. Yes. Yeah, it definitely has more than once."
10754640,10760960," Yeah. I don't think I can recognize it. I will round this corner in a way that you might not"
10760960,10767120," expect though and say it's very uncommon. Okay. I think it would be probably less common than"
10767120,10773440," people watching would expect. But it does happen. I don't know. Sometimes you got to flex the veto"
10773440,10781360," power. Sometimes it's in cool ways where people want you to. It's not always in cool ways."
10781360,10786960," But sometimes it is where everyone will be like, \"Yeah, we probably shouldn't do this for all these"
10786960,10791360," different reasons, but they all want to. But there's a lot of logical reasons why we shouldn't do it.\""
10791360,10796880," And you'll be like, \"Screw it. We're doing it anyways.\" And it's like, \"Yes.\" But like..."
10796880,10802240," Examples. I don't have great examples for this. Maybe whale land would be something."
10802240,10806480," Whale land would definitely be one of those reasons. Yeah, like this is a perfect example for that."
10806480,10812800," A lot of people are going to come at you with the, \"Okay, well, I do business decision things at"
10812800,10818560," your company. I need to explain to you how many different ways this is done.\" And like,"
10818560,10822960," \"We shouldn't do it.\" Technically based off that. And then you can veto and go like,"
10822960,10827440," \"Well, we're doing it anyways because it's cool and I want to have a land.\" It's like, \"Okay, sweet.\""
10827440,10830000," Okay. But what about times I've done it that it's not cool?"
10830000,10836080," Yeah, I know this has happened, but I don't have an example right now because honestly,"
10836080,10840320," again, it doesn't happen that often. So like, I don't think it's happened very recently and I"
10840320,10848480," don't remember. It's happened though. I don't know. It's just not that common."
10848480,10856160," Week. Dan, Dan, you got anything? No, I think you're very level-headed and reasonable."
10856160,10859840," Oh my god, don't be such a kiss, huh? I've only known you for like a year."
10859840,10861360," Go more. Go more. You got to get a raise."
10861360,10866800," Okay, let's see if my wife- You can have a Go XLR."
10866800,10867440," Can come up with me."
10867440,10875120," Oh, my soul just left with my body."
10875120,10884320," Hey, you're live on the WAN show. We had a question. Oh, shoot, it's not there anymore. But"
10884320,10890400," basically it was along the lines of has there ever been a moment in LMG's history when Linus"
10890400,10897520," has had a \"I am Linus Sebastian and this is my company\" moment and I thought you might have a good one."
10897520,10903680," You mean the size of the time when you told me you had to have 51% of the company when we started it?"
10903680,10910000," Okay, yeah, that's probably pretty good. Thanks, hun. See you at home."
10910000,10912560," Thanks for coming in with the save. Appreciate it. You win."
10912560,10914560," I'm going to go for it."
10914560,10922720," God of God. See, there's not that many, but they happen. They definitely happen."
10922720,10926400," It's just not that many. In my defense, it's purely symbolic."
10926400,10930560," Sure. It's true. It's true. Sure."
10930560,10935040," We have no prenup. We are a 50/50 marriage."
10935040,10942320," So half of my 51% of the shares belong to her and half of her 49% of the shares belong to me."
10942880,10948720," We should get into the share conversation and talk about the times that Linus said, \"Screw you,"
10948720,10954160," it's my company.\" Or we can go to the next version. Yeah, we haven't even been able to think of any"
10954160,10962880," smart guy. Well, that's one. I mean, I don't care. I don't make unilateral decisions."
10962880,10966320," We can go to the next. Okay, occasionally I make unilateral decisions."
10966320,10970720," It's rare. I try not to. It is genuinely rare. I think there's also cases where like"
10971680,10975440," if you're leading pretty much anything, you're going to have to sometimes, even if it's just for"
10975440,10979840," like efficiency's case. Because like you can just go around and circle about something forever."
10979840,10985440," And eventually someone has to make it so. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Here's one where there was a lot of"
10985440,10991040," internal conversation about why we don't cover paying for alcoholic company events."
10991040,10996320," So we'll cover food. We'll cover entertainment. We don't cover alcohol. In some cases, actually,"
10996320,11001280," there's an exception. We do cover two drinks at the Christmas party. But aside from the"
11001280,11008400," Christmas party just at events, you are, as long as it is safe, welcome to purchase and consume"
11008400,11014480," your own alcohol, but we don't pay for it. And this was a very circular conversation with"
11014480,11020560," both employees and people in the leadership team where it was like, you know, we're being"
11020560,11025440," prude. It's just because you don't drink. It's this. It's that. It's that. It's that. It's that."
11025440,11030720," It went around and around and around and around. I basically went, look, it's a liability concern."
11030720,11036880," The last thing I need is people behaving in ways that are inappropriate on company,"
11036880,11043440," on company time, on company money. There are there, whether you accept it and acknowledge it or not,"
11043440,11050320," doesn't really matter to me because this has been a problem. Not just, you know,"
11050320,11058320," anecdotally in the news or whatever, but even at companies that people here were at previously."
11058960,11063280," This is an actual real problem and it simply isn't going to happen and the conversation is now over."
11063280,11070320," Was pretty much where I came at it from. And, you know, part of it is the fact that I feel like"
11070320,11074320," I've already given a bulletproof argument and I don't really feel like we need to keep talking"
11074320,11079680," about it. And the other part of it is that, you know, the people that I'm discussing this with"
11079680,11085040," are coming at it with no skin in the game, right? Like if there's a, if there is some kind of event,"
11085040,11091360," even if it's a 1% or a 0.1 or 0.01% chance of some kind of something bad happening,"
11091360,11098400," I'm the one who's liable, not you. So this is my gamble, not yours, which means I make the call,"
11098400,11103360," not you. And that's one of those examples. And that's one of those moments. Yeah,"
11103360,11108880," they're just not coming, but they're going to happen. And then, right, the other part of it was,"
11108880,11114720," you know, I also just don't see why this really matters. I'm sorry, your entertainment budget"
11114720,11123120," isn't big enough. Would you like no entertainment budget? Because the last time I checked, that"
11123120,11128800," ain't in the employee agreement. This is not a requirement. And you know, yeah, I mean, maybe"
11128800,11134720," sometimes I do get a little salty about this stuff. Like the fact that within two months of us"
11134720,11141840," implementing free snacks, the fact that it had managed to generate disgruntledment blew my mind."
11142480,11149520," We went from having no free snacks to it being political and generating complaints and hurting"
11149520,11156800," morale in seemingly an unfathomably short period of time. And you know, my immediate response,"
11156800,11160880," fortunately, I have people around me that help me be more measured. And I also"
11160880,11168000," am a pretty experienced business person, I guess, at this point. But my immediate response to"
11168000,11173040," something like that is, okay, no snacks, then, like no soup for you. Like, why on earth am I"
11173040,11179760," paying money to generate complaints, right? Yeah. We have not done away with snacks. In fact,"
11179760,11187760," we have expanded the snack program. But I, you know, I do, I'm a person, right? And this is, I"
11187760,11191600," mean, this comes down to that same, that conversation that comes up time and again about"
11191600,11196880," whether LMG should unionize, right? Like, from my point of view, well, that's a decision that"
11196880,11202400," needs to be made by the LMG staff. It's there's nothing I could do to prevent it. But me as a"
11202400,11207680," person, as an emotional being, you know, I would feel like I failed. And I don't think there's"
11207680,11212160," anything wrong with that. Because we do actually try, we do actually try to make this a great place"
11212160,11218480," to work. And we try to make it the kind of place to work that you wouldn't need protection from us."
11218480,11223440," And we would want you to not feel like you do. I mean, if you did, then ultimately, that's,"
11224080,11230560," that's your choice, right? But I would like to believe that as long as we continue to put in our"
11230560,11236080," best effort that you won't feel that's necessary. But like I said, there's nothing I could do to"
11236080,11247440," prevent it legally. Okay, last curated merch message. I know this is a big question, but assuming"
11247440,11252160," AI and robotics continue to advance at the rate it has been, would you ever be comfortable with an"
11252160,11259280," AI or an AI robot taking care of your children or the elderly? Children know elderly anything"
11259280,11264880," that gets them off my case. There's a movie about that. Is that is that the quiet part out loud again?"
11264880,11273520," There's a movie about that? Yes, robot and Frank, phenomenal film."
11273520,11281520," Old guy, his son pawns him off with this like robot caretaker. And he teaches it to do crimes."
11282400,11288640," Nice. It sounds hilarious. It's phenomenal. It's really, really good. Cool. And now we're back"
11288640,11295600," into potential. Still trying to chew away at these. Do you want to maybe I can start reading them"
11295600,11301120," or you're welcome to respond via text? I think I can. Are you still going bottom up? Yep. So I'm"
11301120,11306000," going to jump more into the middle. And I think you maybe read from the top. Sure. We try to parallelize"
11306000,11311040," about let's go. Sounds good. Highline us on Wancho a month or so back. You talked about carrying your"
11311040,11318080," with a B day on the LTT store. Are you still working on that? Oh, yeah. How are you liking yours? It's good."
11318080,11324240," I wish I had one on every toilet. I don't. So I can't claim that my butt is particularly clean"
11324240,11337760," right now. But sometimes it's clean. Who do I file complaints to? Hey, DLL. We have HR now."
11337760,11345600," Yeah, we do. Hey, DLL. I can't find HR isn't on a particular side as far as I can tell. HR exists"
11345600,11352320," to keep both sides from yelling at each other. It's a good thing. Yeah. Hey, DLL. I can't find"
11352320,11359120," record of line us talking about ZD TV or tech TV ever before. Did you watch it as a youth like"
11359120,11366400," myself? I didn't have cable. So no, me neither. I also know. I became aware of tech TV when I met"
11366400,11371680," Chris Parello, basically. I only knew him as locker gnome. I didn't even know that he had a career in"
11371680,11380640," media. I probably did before I met him, met him, but I didn't know as I was chasing him in YouTube"
11380640,11386800," subscriber count in my early years. You introduced me to both of those because I had no idea because"
11386800,11393120," I also didn't have cable. I've always wondered, other than GPU block and CPU block, why standard"
11393120,11398480," plumbing fittings from the hardware store are not used as water cooling components in a computer?"
11398480,11404480," Is it a compatibility problem? Yes. For the most part, they use completely different thread"
11404480,11410800," standards than what you would use in a water cooling system in a computer. And for good reason,"
11410800,11418400," they often have much longer threads. They're designed to operate for 50, 100 years uninterrupted."
11418400,11422880," So you'll have threads that are this long and meant to be wrapped with teflon tape and like"
11422880,11427920," threaded in with a wrench. It's not practical to work on a computer like that. You'd have to have"
11427920,11435200," blocks that stuck this far off your motherboard. So nothing would prevent you from using them if"
11435200,11440160," you had compatible blocks, but blocks aren't designed to use them because it sucked. That's"
11440160,11447600," how a lot of things used to work. Thermo chill radiators, for example, used to use BSPP38s or"
11447600,11451360," something like that. I don't know. They were these enormous threaded fittings and they were"

11457360,11464960," ultimate good play. Any plans for other styles of the wag hoodie? I'd love to match my short"
11464960,11473920," circuit one. Also cat beds win. Cat beds actually coming sooner than you think. We are in our"
11474800,11482480," second stage of sampling. Do you know about this? What, sorry? Cat beds. Oh, yes. Yeah. So it's a"
11482480,11487280," it's a PC tower with the side panel off and the side panels a little bit. And then we also have a"
11487280,11494000," CRT monitor that the cat can go inside. Oh my god. Yeah, I know, right? There's definitely been"
11494000,11497440," some communication challenges with the supplier, but we are still working on it."
11500800,11505520," Hi, Linus and Luke, longtime fan of the show. We are expecting our first child in June."
11505520,11510640," Question thinking of your kids? What future tech are you most excited for or most worried about"
11510640,11519600," for them to be using? Cheers. AI. Howdy from the Rocky Mountains. My wife and I are picking up"
11519600,11525520," a the book and sorter for a family announcement. What advice would you give to people who are"
11525520,11533920," going to be first-time parents? Don't say AI again. Have fun. Enjoy it. I know that's such a"
11533920,11544640," stereotypical answer, but like I can barely pick up my eldest anymore. And you know, you kind of"
11544640,11549840," someday I won't be able to do it anymore. And you're going to wish you could do it one more time,"
11549840,11558160," you know? Oof. Catching the fields on Wancho. Yeah, it's okay. It's okay."
11558160,11564160," Why is this going to the gym with me? We'll make it so you can get lived. Yeah, but he's coming to"
11564160,11571920," the gym too. He's going to get huge. York. Hey guys, love the show. Linus, have you played"
11571920,11576800," around with MB anymore? What are your thoughts on how it compares to Plex? I haven't. I've been"
11576800,11582400," lazy in spite of the fact that there are still some things broken in Plex like just playing the next"
11582400,11589600," show, for example, is like maybe a 50/50 shot for me on the Android app. It's really frustrating,"
11589600,11596960," but I'm just I'm lazy. Do you think it's okay for people users in an office to be computer literate?"
11596960,11601760," What baseline of computer ability do you think people should have nowadays? The question is,"
11601760,11609040," is it okay for them to be illiterate? No. I think that computer literacy is basically a"
11609040,11615840," necessity for functioning in the modern world. And if your computer illiterate, it reveals to me"
11615840,11622320," that you are an uncurious person because- Ooh, that's a bad one. Yeah, because"
11622320,11630960," the internet and technology is your gateway to learning, right? And so if you haven't figured"
11630960,11635760," out what an efficient learning tool it is, then you either haven't looked that hard or you just"
11635760,11646400," don't care, which to me means you probably are uncurious, an uncurious person. Linus and Luke,"
11646400,11653680," working in and around your industries, and for all the knowledge you have, no one sees the future."
11653680,11658800," What sort of- what- some tech you are completely surprised by that came into being?"
11658800,11663760," Well, I am on the record on WAN Show saying crypto would never be used for anything."
11663760,11670240," Like real transactions, not never be used for anything. I said it wouldn't be used for any"
11670240,11674640," real transactions when someone made news for buying a house with it or something like that."
11674640,11678400," I was like, well, that's the one off that'll- so that worked out great for me. Yeah."
11680960,11689360," I thought VR was closer and AI was further. Yeah. We still haven't hit that date that I said for"
11689360,11693440," VR, but I don't think it's looking good. I don't know. Apple's- Apple's-"
11693440,11699680," We'll see. They might launch and save my prediction. Yeah, some insiders or who have tested it or like-"
11699680,11703520," Whoa, I blew me away. Really? Or something. I have no way to tell if they're telling the truth,"
11703520,11713040," though. Oh, hopefully. But yeah. Yeah. Excited the WAG hoodie is finally here. Linus, do you think"
11713040,11718560," you'll try the Pixel Fold when it comes out or just stick with the Galaxy Fold? I will 100%"
11718560,11724240," try a hypothetical Pixel Fold when it comes out. There are some definite frustrations with the"
11724240,11732480," Galaxy Fold. I'll be very curious to see if YouTube or if Google on their own device manages to"
11732480,11737360," fix some of the problems I still have with the YouTube app on this one. If they don't,"
11737360,11744480," rest assured I will tear them a new one over it. Luke, I know you don't like and don't shop on"
11744480,11749840," Amazon, but with items being cheap on Amazon and stores, it's easier to just buy on Amazon,"
11749840,11756320," especially when money's tight. What do you think? Yeah, it's tough. I don't for the reasons that"
11756320,11763040," I have, but I don't expect that others necessarily do the same. I also, I'm very cheap in a lot of"
11763040,11770480," ways, and then also I make good money. So it's not generally a problem for me. So I will go out of"
11770480,11775040," my way and often end up spending more to get it from mom and pop shops and brick and mortars whenever"
11775040,11782640," I can, or find alternatives when I can't. But I am not about to sit here and preach at people"
11783600,11789360," telling them to spend extra money on things that they maybe can't afford when they're just doing"
11789360,11796160," what they can to get by. So do what you're going to do. Yeah, that's about it. Any updates on Linus's"
11796160,11801760," smart home still using an enjoying home assistant? I've been using it for years in open source software"
11801760,11811200," for the win. Yep, still using home assistant, still happy with it, other than those switches that"
11811200,11817120," I'm still having trouble with with Z-Wave, JS, or whatever, I'm hopefully going to switch over to"
11817120,11821840," those upcoming in a valley ones project Linus. Oh, hey, how'd their how'd their indie go go go?"
11821840,11826960," In the valley? I haven't looked at it recently."
11826960,11837680," Okay, adding keyword indie go go. I swear, like Google search has gotten a lot worse."
11840080,11848000," Wow, they raised $222,000. They have nine days left. Okay, well, that is funded. So yeah, hopefully"
11848000,11854960," I'll get switches at some point. That'll be cool. Where are we in potential? There we are. Oh,"
11854960,11864960," Linus, any updates on LTT and Espier-Nure? Yes, right now, I think it's like 10 days behind or"
11864960,11872000," something like that because there's like gating that's going on with the like AI service that"
11872000,11876400," we're using to translate. Oh, that's unfortunate. Yeah, well, the workaround is that we just use"
11876400,11881200," multiple accounts and they're apparently okay with it or something. Yeah, no, no, no, Ed's"
11881200,11887760," working through it with the goal for him this quarter is to get it to within two days of release."
11887760,11894640," Cool. For LTT. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, LLD, what is currently a piece of tech that you are really"
11894640,11902080," impressed with right now besides AI? PlayStation 5 is kind of killing it. PSVR 2 is like kind of"
11902080,11910080," awesome. I think the mobile gaming devices just as a pool. Steam deck, the new one, whatever it's"
11910080,11917840," called. Ally. Ally, that one, those things. They're cool. I love the allies to wait."
11919120,11925360," Let me get the bell. No, it's not fun now. Will it be worthy?"
11925360,11935760," Okay, I love these new stickers. I was wondering if you had plans to do a bird option. We have"
11935760,11944960," two con con years. Ally is cool. And that's the truth. It's actually pretty good. You waited"
11944960,11950080," long enough that no one was expecting it and it became good again. That was very tactical of you."
11950080,11954960," He's getting advanced. I'm not gonna lie, when I saw the the cat and dog stickers today, I was"
11954960,11959600," like a bird. One would be pretty cool. But I don't think I'm not anywhere even remotely close to as"
11959600,11965600," many people have birds than people. I think you're the only one. I have no one else here that I'm"
11965600,11971040," aware of as birds. Yeah. And I think the cats and dog stickers are like the company's cats and dogs,"
11971040,11978560," right? So unless you want a sticker pack of two birds, they're both fine. You know what? You know"
11978560,11984240," what? We'll do a pen. Oh, that's cool. Oh, that's pretty cool. That is cool."
11984240,11990720," Wait for him to send his text message. No, no, hit me."
11990720,11997440," Linus, I produce my company's YouTube channel working alongside with my SME who has ADHD and"
11997440,12003360," is our brand ambassador. All right. What kinds of methods have you employed to ensure your"
12003360,12008480," personality shines through the script? The easiest way is to edit all the scripts myself,"
12008480,12015040," which is not particularly efficient. But I haven't found a better way yet."
12015040,12019440," So cool. Yeah."
12023680,12029440," Sweet. Have you ever considered incorporating magnets into garments would love a"
12029440,12036080," magnetically detachable hoodie on LTT store.com? We do have magnets in some of our garments."
12036080,12043120," Our shorts have magnets and magnetic flaps on the like side pockets. I'm trying to think if there's"
12043120,12048560," anywhere else that we use magnets probably I can't remember off the top of my head. But I will tell"
12048560,12054800," you that a magnetically attaching hoodie would not be a great idea. And the reasons for that are"
12054800,12060240," a couple fold. So one is that in order for them to be strong enough, they would have to be quite"
12060240,12066320," large, which adds cost and complexity and construction and also increases weight. And having that"
12066320,12071680," around a hood could be quite challenging. Also, there'd be no way to make it sure that it really"
12071680,12077200," attaches permanently when you're grabbing on it. Garments get manhandled a lot. It's sort of inherent."
12077200,12081280," And the third reason is that they can be damaged by heat. So anything that would go in the dryer,"
12081280,12091120," you could risk the magnets losing some of their magnetic strength over time. And something like a"
12091120,12096400," hoodie becomes non-functional if the magnetic strength falls too much. Something like a pocket"
12096400,12100720," that's already kind of being held down by gravity, but the magnet just keeps it clicked into place"
12100720,12111840," is less likely to suffer like a functionality deficiency due to the loss of magnetic strength."
12111840,12116960," So something that we have to use strategically. I love magnets though."
12116960,12124000," Pretty cool. We've got some curated here. I think you guys did. Hi, Dan. And I guess Linus and Luke,"
12124000,12127920," two questions. Do you think you'll ever do a collab with Bitwit again? And whatever happened to"
12127920,12134720," Brian the electrician? Brian moved and I think we were potentially discussing doing a collab with"
12134720,12139600," Kyle like upcoming. I haven't worked with him in forever just because of travel and stuff, but"
12139600,12145520," yeah, don't worry. We're still friends. Hi Linus and Luke, watched everything since the parking lot"
12145520,12152480," days before when existed. Any plans to implement a feedback from the working for LMG videos?"
12152480,12160400," P.S., Luke's mom on Wancho again, win. Feedback from the working video. Linus can't watch it."
12160400,12168800," So I believe the rest of us can. So there's what I can say is there's already been some effort,"
12168800,12173680," but a lot of the things that were complained about were already known issues, which is good."
12173680,12180480," Yeah, because we did a round of one-on-one interviews with HR and literally everyone"
12180480,12185760," before we did that video. So yeah, I'm not watching the video because I said I wouldn't,"
12185760,12190080," but I wouldn't expect there to be any surprises there. There wouldn't be any surprises. So yeah,"
12190080,12195440," and like there are things that even before the one-on-ones, a lot of them we already knew and"
12195440,12201360," were working on. A lot of them are related to just being an extremely high velocity workplace."
12201360,12206240," And there's things being done to work on that. I don't know. Yeah, all the other managers can"
12206240,12211520," watch it just he can't watch it. You don't. Joseph asks, \"When are we going to get a Linus and Luke"
12211520,12217440," review sexualized LTT fan art video float plane exclusive?\" What? I already typed the response."
12217440,12224880," We are never doing that. The last thing we need is to egg you people on. There's a lot of it though."
12224880,12230480," And what's going on? I thought we were almost out, but no, there's oh, it's even coming. They don't"
12230480,12237680," stop coming. Yeah, I think Linus, if you start at the top of incoming. Thanks for making my Friday"
12237680,12244320," and Saturday so much better. LLND, what's a life lesson you could learn from an aging piece of"
12244320,12253040," technology? Tape drive, record player, cassette disc. What speaks to you? I still love hard drives."
12254240,12266080," Yeah. I love the marriage of digital and mechanical innovation that the hard drive is one of those,"
12266080,12270720," what's the quote? Something, something sufficiently advanced technology is indiscernible for magic."
12270720,12277200," Hard drives are indiscernible from magic to me. And I don't mean that literally. I understand how"
12277200,12282800," they work. Even if you deeply understand how they work, it's still just like what?"
12283520,12290640," There's hurricane force winds inside a hard drive. And yet it still manages to operate at nano scale."
12290640,12297360," Yeah, it's like, I forget how a WD rep described it to us once, but it was like a bird flying"
12297360,12303840," three inches over the ground in a hurricane or something like that, and managing to perform"
12303840,12312720," this task. It's mind blowing to me, hard drives. I love hard drives. I like game cartridges."
12312880,12319360," I also, okay, here's a controversial take. I like hard drives because"
12319360,12326160," I miss the thinking sounds computers make. I don't miss that. Not even a little. I know,"
12326160,12331440," but I do. If you watch an old movie and like they got to do something on the computer and you"
12331440,12339200," hear it like, so sick, so cool. Floppy drive seeking noises, that sort of thing. Yeah, it's great."
12339200,12345840," Yeah, it's sweet. But like electric cars putting speakers in their engine base to make the sound"
12345840,12350560," of ice cars is stupid. And I don't want my computer to like have a speaker that makes it"
12350560,12355040," sound like it's working. That's stupid. I just want it to like actually, if it's actually a thing,"
12355040,12360640," that's cool. That's it. M dot two SSD that has a speaker that plays hard drive noises."
12360640,12367520," I hate it. Come on, AliExpress. Let's go. Okay, a couple more curated here. Hey, Linus for"
12367520,12372960," transparency sake. Why don't you guys talk about bill of materials, bill of services, and how"
12372960,12379440," much you make on a product, your margins, maybe start with today's launch, the WAG hoodie."
12379440,12382720," Other than that, they're none of your business. I don't really know."
12382720,12396480," Yeah, if we were a public company, we would disclose that because our shareholders have a"
12396480,12408160," vested interest. But if we decide to strategically take lower margin on one product and make it up"
12408160,12414480," somewhere else, I just don't really feel like I owe anybody an explanation for that. For us,"
12414480,12422160," it's more about making sure that the quality of the product justifies the end retail price."
12425120,12435200," Compared to other competing products out there. I don't really think it matters."
12435200,12442400," Yeah, people are talking to chat. Even in private companies or even in public companies,"
12442400,12447920," margins are expressed more generally or sometimes a business unit by business unit. But generally,"
12447920,12452160," not all the way down to an individual product, a lot of companies consider that to be"
12453760,12459120," highly confidential trade secret information even, how much margins they're able to make."
12459120,12466560," Because say AMD knew how much margin NVIDIA was making on an RTX 4090, they could take that"
12466560,12473280," information and turn it around into a competitive advantage against NVIDIA by squeezing TSMC or"
12473280,12480080," board partners or whatever else the case may be. So I can see why AMD would want to know,"
12480080,12483360," but I don't see why there would be any benefit to NVIDIA to disclose that."
12483360,12493040," Next up, Linus, how was your neurodivergence hindered you on the path to getting to the"
12493040,12500720," successful place you are today? What strategies do you use to overcome it? Or has it possibly"
12500720,12507440," helped in certain scenarios? I don't really think of... What are we divergent from if we are all"
12507440,12513280," divergent? Yeah, I'm about to get spicy here because I don't necessarily consider ADHD to be"
12513280,12520000," neurodivergent in that sense. I don't really consider it to be a major disadvantage. I think"
12520000,12526400," everybody's a little bit different and we can try and group people into buckets and sort them by"
12526400,12534480," color or by the method that they are best approach a problem or whatever else it is. But at the end"
12534480,12540000," of the day, all we get is the hand-redeld and we've got to make it work. There's definitely been times"
12540000,12545280," that not being able to focus on stuff has been challenging. I mean, I flunked out of school."
12545280,12554160," That's a pretty bad mark. The beginning of the hack? Yeah, I was pretty useless there. There's"
12554160,12559200," definitely times that it's challenging, but the best thing that you can do is surround yourself"
12559200,12565680," with people that make you better. Surround yourself with people who fill those holes. Take my wife."
12565680,12573200," She is super focused but doesn't have that same creative dragon energy that I do. She found a"
12573200,12583680," partner that fills her holes. Which is good. I was not going to dignify that."
12585760,12590880," I'm recognizing some of the words that were said now because I was very focused on what I was typing."
12590880,12603920," Wow. Wow. We have five seconds left until our end of time. Let's not leave there."
12603920,12612960," All right. We still got some incoming. Leaving it there would be so funny though."
12612960,12618240," Could just end the stream. If you say bye, I have to play the outro."
12618240,12620880," It would be a bit of a flaccid point to leave it on. We should keep going."
12620880,12626640," Nice one, Luke. I haven't had one of those for me for a long time."
12626640,12636480," Any more incoming that pique your interest? How about Luke goes through that while I rapid fire"
12636480,12642320," try to respond to them? Sounds good. Okay. So you're reading them out to be clear."
12642320,12650480," Okay. Sweet replacement of my Aorus 3P3x Thunder. Two questions. Any plans for"
12650480,12656640," power play compatible sizes of the pads and any on the accounting team slated for an AMD upgrade?"
12656640,12660400," My wife is actually getting an upgrade. She's technically on the accounting team."
12661440,12667920," As for power play compatible sizes of the pads, yeah, I think the 30 centimeter tall one"
12667920,12673920," fits right over top of a pad. You can see it in any of my recent setup videos. So it just"
12673920,12679680," lays across it and that's how I use it. Hello. First, I'm making it live to the WAN show and"
12679680,12685440," leaving a merch message. Do gift card values accumulate in my account or is it like I can only use one"
12685440,12691040," per purchase? Love you guys. They don't sit in your account. I don't think. I actually don't know how"
12691040,12695600," they work. I've never bought a gift card from my own store. Technically me either. Yeah. I think"
12695600,12699680," it's a code. I don't think it's maximum one per purchase. No, no, you can definitely use more"

12711120,12715760," Shopify discard. So it's probably very googly. We have a new button in the merch message thing."
12715760,12719760," What you can do is you can hit support and then it'll create a ticket for a support team"
12719760,12724080," and then our support team should reach out to you via email that you left your merch message."
12724080,12731040," Okay. Next up. Hey, DLL. That one just disappeared. Do you think there's a work opportunity for"

12825440,12828640," even though it's just a platformer game. Lucky's Tale was the first, like,"
12828640,12833840," this is an actual game and not just a tech demo. Not just like a roller coaster you sit on and"
