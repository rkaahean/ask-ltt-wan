233560,235200," word monster even the biggest one I"
235200,238400," think mortals is equally tall okay it's"
238400,239920," the biggest one sure it's the biggest"

251760,254960," monster is insisting that they need to"
254960,258640," remove the color green from their logo"
258640,261840," oh come on I didn't even know about that"
261840,265160," part this is the kind of thing that I've"
265160,269240," got to look at and go what is the 4d"
269240,271200," chest that they're playing here yeah it"
271200,273840," is the is the idea that there's no such"
273840,276080," thing as bad publicity and anything that"
276080,278800," gets people talking about monster in any"
278800,282720," context is inherently good because like"
282720,284000," let's think about this for a second"
284000,286480," their their beverage tastes like piss"
286480,291040," water right I haven't had a monster in"
291040,292840," so long I don't even know but like I"
292840,294760," mean I tried it recently for short"
294760,297080," circuit with that said I'm not the biggest"
297080,301200," fan of energy drinks in general but it"
301200,304880," was not cool it I'm sorry no amount of"
304880,308320," extreme you know athletes doing whatever"
308320,310400," in their promotional materials is going"
310400,312880," to make drinking that cool it might make"
312880,315280," it might energize you or whatever else"
315280,317600," but it doesn't like who knows maybe it"
317600,319840," has efficacy but yeah you could you could"
319840,321680," taste you could find stuff that that"
321680,323920," tastes better for sure yeah for the same"
323920,326160," price or a lower one there's there's also"
326160,328320," like insane amount of options in that"
328320,330560," realm well yeah that's right so many"
330560,332640," opposite super competitive space yeah so"
332640,334560," I'm looking at it going the point of this"
334560,336800," obviously isn't that anyone will"
336800,339680," actually confuse your brand the point of"
339680,342240," this can't be to try to draw in a new"
342240,345680," customer by how cool and magnanimously"
345680,348880," you are behaving so the only thing I can"
348880,351680," think of is that you've got enough people"
351680,353840," out there addicted to your particular"
353840,356880," formula of piss water that they're kind"
356880,359920," of going oh right monster I haven't had"
359920,362240," one of those in a while by like beating"
362240,365440," up some indie company"
366320,369040," I know they are they are definitely"
369040,370560," getting coverage I knew about this"
370560,372160," before I saw it in the doc so did I"
372160,377280," I don't think we can even pull this"
377280,379200," because I don't think we can trust people's"
379200,383760," like stated opinions right you'd have to"
383760,386000," trust their market actions because those"
386000,388640," are very often not the same thing but"
388640,390320," like I wonder how effective that's going"
390320,392880," to be because there's no way in how"
393840,396000," this would make me want to buy something"
396000,398000," from monster or do the opposite now here's"
398000,401120," the thing this is not even a new"
401120,403680," behavior for them they are notorious"
403680,405920," for these kinds of frivolous nonsense"
405920,411600," lawsuits in 20 this is great in 2016"
411600,414640," monster lost a suit against monster"
414640,418080," fishkeepers which is that even is that"
418080,421360," even still a thing hey we're heading to"
421360,425120," monsterfishkeepers.com let's go this is"
425120,427920," apparently an aquarium enthusiast forum"
427920,432320," support and defend monster fishkeepers"
432320,434720," okay hold on a second this is from"
434720,438240," support and defend it this is an entire"
438240,441120," subforum we won okay this is from"
441120,445280," February of 2016 we've been battling"
445280,447760," with monster energy since 2014 I have"
447760,450320," beaten the monster monster energy now"
450320,452640," has a ruling against its ludicrous and"
452640,454480," overreaching argument that it owns the"
454480,456960," word monster hopefully this will help the"
456960,458560," hundreds of other small businesses being"
458560,462000," bullied by them wow this is amazing"
462000,464320," shout out neo prodigy for all I know you"
464320,466720," kill cats in your spare time but from this"
466720,469760," post alone you seem pretty cool and I'm"
469760,472480," super into it apparently they've gone after"
472480,476800," pokemon for pocket monsters and they've"
476800,479600," gone after monster hunter saying that there"
479600,482080," is confused there could be confusion in"
482080,485040," 2022 they tried to block hundreds of"
485040,488000," trademarks including moody monster a"
488000,490640," therapy toy for mentally ill children"
490640,493200," and the logo of the brookay brookhaven"
493200,496080," bears baseball team because it contains"
496080,498320," claw marks oh my"
498320,504720," hold on i've got to see this logo now i"
504720,510320," mean they just they just sound like"
510320,514000," just idiots you know like i don't i don't"
514000,516160," know i i i this feels impossible to"
516160,518240," actually implement impossible to police"
518240,520800," impossible to manage we probably shouldn't"
520800,522480," actually do it but it would be cool if"
522480,525440," there was like some type of thing that"
525440,527520," would monitor and detect stuff like this"
527520,531040," and be like you are overly abusing your"
531040,532480," rights blah blah blah and then you just"
532480,534960," lose your trademark just screw it like no"
534960,536400," you've done you've done too much you've"
536400,539120," gone too far you're just trying to use"
539120,540720," the people who don't defend your people"
540720,542960," in float plane are talking about kylie"
542960,546000," jennifer versus kylie minogue what in"
546000,549600," 2014 kylie jennifer wanted to register her"
549600,552640," name as a trademark but was prevented by"
552640,558000," singer kylie minogue wait wait she wanted to"
558000,561200," register kylie just kylie you shouldn't be"
561200,563840," all to register names or just standard"
563840,566080," english words well words in any other"
566080,568240," language really but i mean the thing is"
568240,569920," that you can at least oh hold on i've got"
569920,572800," the brookhaven bears logo this doesn't even"
572800,576800," look like the monster slash oh my god"
576800,578560," it doesn't it's not that the monster"
578560,580480," slash is very it's like three railroad"
580480,583200," spikes like this is this is it's very"
583200,586960," specific this is obviously inspired by a"
586960,590240," bear a bear swipe not a monster and does"
590240,593040," not evoke the look of the monster energy"
593040,598560," logo at all now the point is not that they"
598560,600320," think they're necessarily going to win"
600320,602560," this a major reason for these lawsuits"
602560,606000," aside from harassment protecting your trademark"
606000,608800," because is it trademarks that if you don't"
608800,611280," protect them that you can you can lose them"
611280,613600," so aside from protecting your trademark is"
613600,618640," just to um just to bully and intimidate others"
618640,622400," into giving in because of the threat of a"
622400,626320," long and expensive legal battle um"
626320,629840," apparently though glow stick entertainment plans to fight the lawsuit in"
629840,632000," court and is currently pushing for a"
632000,635280," summary dismissal uh the discussion question"
635280,637280," here i mean is pretty much what we've already"
637280,639360," talked about what is the motivation for"
639360,642400," monsters perspective wouldn't the risk of"
642400,645440," consumers seeing this and going wow what a"
645440,650320," bunch of jerk wads um outweigh any possible"
650320,653680," benefit but then you know i gotta ask like"
653680,658880," you drink monster energy like your standards are pretty low i guess so"
658880,663680," not i have a question i actually don't care you drink whatever energy drink you"
663680,665440," want when we're when are you suing the line of"
665440,670720," bicycles right right or or um oh man there's"
670720,673920," this other there's this other lyrics sounds pretty similar"
673920,677040," there could be confused there has been confusion we have"
677040,682240," documented confusion that legitimately has caused confusion we should sue the"
682240,685760," linux found i get called linux on a fairly regular basis"
685760,688960," especially by two people who second language is english"
688960,692240," yeah because it's just i don't know s excellent"
692240,697280," same thing right you want to you want to you want to lose a lot of fans"
697280,701040," let's go let's go sue the linux foundation that'll go really well"
701040,706320," oh this is just stupid i hate it yeah i don't know in some"
706320,709280," kit like i like i wasn't even i wasn't even"
709280,714320," super mad over the the dumb tech pouch thing with peak designs"
714320,718560," like or peak design whatever it is i i wasn't even that mad because it's like"
718560,722640," yeah trademarking just a descriptive name is"
722640,725760," something we could probably fight and it's super dumb"
725760,729360," but i don't care now it's the tech sack and it's selling great like it just"
729360,732880," it's a funnier name anyways it doesn't matter not necessarily a better name but"
732880,737840," it's a funnier name this is far far more frivolous"
737840,742640," yeah this is ridiculous apparently they actually"
742640,748240," filed against ubisoft over the title of the game gods and monsters"
748240,751680," and ubisoft did change the name to immortals"
751680,756400," phoenix rising ending the dispute my understanding though is that in the"
756400,761760," games industry it is extremely common to just like"
761760,766480," have to change the name of your game in the lead up to launch just because it's"
766480,772240," such a well there's so many yams yeah it's such a crowded space"
772240,776480," um and when like this genuinely happens by the way"
776480,780400," we've played them they're kind of funny sometimes but people will take like"
780400,784080," unity demos and spend like i don't know a day"
784080,788640," or less editing it and then just put it on steam and sell it"
788640,792400," when you can do that with any number of names for your games yeah"
792400,796880," like uh the the chance that a name that is similar to the name of the game that"
796880,799760," you're going to release is already out because of"
799760,804000," any reason is extremely high very very high"
804000,809520," so in summary monster sucks yeah choose another"
809520,812800," energy drink if you drink energy drinks yeah"
812800,815920," not promoting any particular one just don't drink that one if you like it why"
815920,818800," is denis here"

861200,865280," i saw so many people confused by this thing it is not actually made a burlap i"

1586960,1589280," fries"

1598960,1599600," hair on it"

1610080,1617280," yeah okay all right the hair's not your hair i believe you it wasn't black"
1617280,1622640," so that's good it was a little bit curly so i don't know that it was a head"
1622640,1625600," hair but it was something"
1625600,1631440," um okay why don't we why don't we let me pick what we're going to talk"
1631440,1635760," about next let's move on let's talk about um"
1635760,1640480," what everyone thought was my fault um for for fairly reasonable reasons"
1640480,1643520," which was uh tech linked just getting deleted"
1643520,1649040," yeah at like four in the morning yeah so i got to sleep through it this time"
1649040,1652960," yeah which was kind of amazing yeah can i just say"
1652960,1657280," shout out and great job everyone who was involved in the mitigation there"
1657280,1661760," yeah yeah we i there was a few points in time where we were like should we wake"
1661760,1664560," up lines and one but there was nothing really"
1664560,1668880," additional that you guys could do because it like it wasn't a security"
1668880,1671680," thing this time okay go back to square one"
1671680,1676000," um at about four in the morning ish i don't know the exact time because i was"
1676000,1679600," not the person that caught it but at about four in the morning ish the"
1679600,1682400," earliest message that i got i believe was at four ten"
1682400,1687840," um the tech linked channel was just straight up"
1687840,1692400," obliterated out of nowhere there was there was no like yeah"
1692400,1696880," there was no like progression of channel flags or anything it was just"
1696880,1701680," gone plus yote it was it was yoted at four in the"
1701680,1706080," morning i don't know yeah um we we get a few messages about it"
1706080,1709600," eventually colton calls me at like six in the morning or something and is like"
1709600,1713920," hey like what the heck's going on uh we look into it doesn't seem to be any"
1713920,1717360," security problems or anything like that the channel's just"
1717360,1720960," gone we're like what the heck eventually we message"
1720960,1724720," uh google and they got it fixed pretty quickly i think we're still maybe"
1724720,1727120," dealing with some issues or it was recently resolved where comments"
1727120,1730400," weren't there for a while yeah there seemed to be some missing comments or"
1730400,1732560," something like that yeah so the channel's still kind of"
1732560,1735760," getting properly for all i know that may be"
1735760,1739440," uh remnant of the original hijack though because i don't know if all the"
1739440,1742960," comments were correctly restored in the first place"
1742960,1747120," uh it's definitely worse now if it was bad before sure because i've seen some"
1747120,1752320," weird behavior on ltt where the comment might be there if i view it publicly"
1752320,1754320," but it's not showing up in the dashboard there is"
1754320,1757440," definitely some problems from back then but"
1757440,1760320," tech linked had like no comments on anything"
1760320,1764800," right it was it was like super super bad um so maybe it got like worse maybe"
1764800,1768320," it compounded i don't know so it's still it's still sort of being restored or"
1768320,1771120," maybe it's done now i haven't checked on it in about 24 hours"
1771120,1775600," um but yeah it just got it just got yeeted and i don't believe"
1775600,1778960," google has made an official statement on what happened"
1778960,1784640," i am fairly confident luke has a theory yeah i don't know but that's just a"
1784640,1788160," theory so wait wait what channel are we on such"
1788160,1792480," um i think they they listen to the cries of a bunch of us including lienus and i"
1792480,1796160," um saying that these streams should be caught with"
1796160,1800000," content id way sooner yeah especially because it's"
1800000,1803760," always the same stupid stream so once you've identified one of these scammer"
1803760,1808000," streams i thought that's the whole point of content id"
1808000,1812160," is that you're supposed to take down harmful or infringing content"
1812160,1817920," yeah and yet this stupid elon crypto streams scam thing clearly running"
1817920,1820800," rampant on the platform yeah doing nothing about it yeah so i think they"
1820800,1825040," did actually start doing something about it kudos by the way yes that is good"
1825040,1827760," however but it detected a bunch of"
1827760,1832240," privateed versions of those streams so videos that like yeah you should"
1832240,1834400," probably get rid of it eventually but like it's private it's not doing anything"
1834400,1837360," no one can access it yeah i actually had left the archive of"
1837360,1840560," that stream up on in our channel for like the memes"
1840560,1843920," and i had meant to post on social about it like uh you know hey"
1843920,1846880," you guys remember our this classic live stream like i don't know i"
1846880,1850240," yeah like it doesn't it doesn't really matter anymore yeah once it's private"
1850240,1854880," yeah but content id can still search private videos yeah and the reason for"
1854880,1859120," that is that many people will upload copyrighted content like movies"
1859120,1863200," privately just so that they can like watch it"
1863200,1866400," yeah outside of their house like oh this is my version of plex uh-huh like"
1866400,1870080," yeah just uploading stuff to you too can't use it that way so it should it"
1870080,1872560," should i'm not complaining about it searching private videos"
1872560,1875680," but it detected not just our channel not just tech linked"
1875680,1878800," but also a bunch of other people's channels because after it happened i had a"
1878800,1881520," bunch of people reach out and be like yeah my channel got new to two for this"
1881520,1885360," exact same thing and luckily it seems like across the board"
1885360,1889120," google is responding very quickly and getting people's accounts back"
1889120,1894320," which is not the most characteristic so i appreciate that it is happening"
1894320,1898640," that's good this is an improvement happy um but yeah no official statement pretty"
1898640,1902000," short content id flagged it and then just started nuking channels"
1902000,1906880," um which you know i understand the world is not one"
1906880,1909680," time zone but it sucked that that happened in four in the morning at four"
1909680,1912160," in the morning for us it also sucked that there was no"
1912160,1917840," warning or flag or heads up or anything whatsoever you just obliterate this"
1917840,1921280," channel out of nowhere it i am constantly amazed"
1921280,1924640," with these big companies how it feels like"
1924640,1928640," like three quarters of the time there's too many people too many moving parts and"
1928640,1932160," they just get cog jammed and they can't move forward or do anything"
1932160,1936000," and then out of nowhere it just seems like something super fly by night just"
1936000,1939600," like zooms in and just there was no oversight or thought there's like oh yeah"
1939600,1943360," we should contact idithm good idea boom and just blow everything up"
1943360,1947760," like especially because it's not like we had three copies of the stream"
1947760,1951440," sitting in our channel it was what are we strikes two maybe"
1951440,1956960," it wasn't three though it wasn't three it's it's it's mind blowing"
1956960,1961120," and like other channels that we had had private versions of that stream as well"
1961120,1965440," but those didn't get taken down which is like"
1965440,1968960," okay yeah so like did they run it and then realize like oh crap"
1968960,1971360," i'm not sure we didn't think about this use case and then stop it and it"
1971360,1974880," didn't get all the way through or i don't know what happened but uh yeah"
1974880,1979760," this was not a new issue this was an artifact of the original issue that"
1979760,1984560," happened a couple weeks ago um just like re-biting us um and it's been fixed"
1984560,1988080," already everything's good we're fine this hilarious youtube chat is actually"
1988080,1993120," moving slow enough that i can see it for a change uh watch them try to retroactively"
1993120,1997920," sue sesame street for cookie monster yeah anyway sorry just let's we can keep"
1997920,2004800," moving oh my goodness um so anyway kudos youtube"
2004800,2008160," for getting this sorted out but also what the heck"
2008160,2013040," dang it youtube you can't just you can't just like delete channels like that"
2013040,2016720," i mean they can i guess but probably shouldn't yeah probably shouldn't"
2016720,2021520," yeah um let's go ahead and jump into our next topic here which is going to be"
2021520,2025600," and like it would probably be less destructive if instead of deleting the"
2025600,2029600," channel if you got rid of that content and then like"
2029600,2032880," locked it so it couldn't upload for a certain amount of time but people could"
2032880,2035840," still view it and externally it didn't look like anything was wrong and then"
2035840,2038800," you resolve it with the creator instead of just be like"
2038800,2043680," boo oh okay we can restore it but all your comments are gone like just"
2043680,2048640," maybe slightly less destructive actions could be cool um i know you can do that"
2048640,2051520," type of stuff because you can stop people from being able to stream"
2051520,2054800," yeah so if you can just stop them from also being able to post"
2054800,2059360," anything so community updates or vods or anything else shorts whatever if you"
2059360,2062880," just stop all posting capabilities until it's resolved like a read-only state"
2062880,2067600," that would be a way better solution yeah it honestly may not be that simple"
2067600,2071040," though it might not be i don't know you know from experience that things can"
2071040,2074480," be more complicated and they seem simple absolutely why can't people edit a"
2074480,2078560," comment under a float plane video well after all these years after"
2078560,2087680," hardware unboxed after hardware unboxed yeah asked for comment editing drink"
2087680,2092240," lttstore.com i need some uncle lis's moonshite"
2092240,2097440," i'm teasing him because we have had some issues with transcoding and it has been"
2097440,2100400," a frustration from the folks over at hardware unboxed that they can't edit"
2100400,2104160," comments but there is some good news uh we haven't"
2104160,2108240," figured out the fix for transcoding but we do have a band-aid that has been"
2108240,2112320," applied and on and we're working on it we'll get a fix and on the comment"
2112320,2116880," editing side of things that is actually working on the"
2116880,2120000," beta site for float plane beta dot float plane dot com"
2120000,2124640," don't put in the www that is apparently a um"
2124640,2132880," amateur move so yeah i tried to navigate with www and it did not work"
2132880,2138880," now to be clear i did not type in www like a baby boomer"
2138880,2142960," i just was on float plane dot com and edit the url clicked the url and then"
2142960,2147600," it is more advanced added beta yes it the www"
2147600,2153280," was already there i just didn't remove it i wish i wish you forgot that you did"
2153280,2158240," that oh no oh no i do not search the worldwide"
2158240,2163840," web sir wwww dot oh it would have been great if you"
2163840,2168160," forgot but yeah nope i knew you were i knew you were"
2168160,2174160," gonna go after me for that yeah why would you tap in ww i did it"
2174160,2178240," i didn't call you a boomer no no not even the web over there mr"
2178240,2183040," linus not even uh speaking of things that are i don't know i don't"
2183040,2189520," have a good segue for this intel yeah intel arc battle mage and"
2189520,2194480," intel arc celestial are still happening tsmc has reported"
2194480,2199200," have has reportedly received a large number of orders to produce chips for"
2199200,2203680," intel's next gen battle mage gpu's this means that all three major gpu"
2203680,2207440," brands are now contracting tsmc silicon thank you lainus"
2207440,2211760," so i was doing it subconsciously i'm one of those people that does this"
2211760,2215280," like i i tend to kind of go like this as i'm reading along to things"
2215280,2221120," it drives luke absolutely crazy because it does this on his screen and just"
2221120,2225520," like so his name just goes all over the place and it will block words"
2225520,2228800," and i'm already i'm i already have a hard time reading"
2228800,2233440," because i'm dyslexic so then not only is my brain just going like"
2233440,2237280," with all the words and letters and stuff but now it's blocking them out"
2237280,2241360," so when so when he couldn't read reportedly received a large he's he said"
2241360,2244160," like a large number of orders or something like that and i was like"
2244160,2249040," oh crap i'm doing that thing again so my options now are to stop doing it"
2249040,2253600," or to double down he did in the immediate reaction was he moved his mouth"
2253600,2256320," somewhere else and then i saw it pause there for a second i was like he's"
2256320,2259600," coming back then he just starts bouncing all over the place and i was like oh"
2259600,2262240," goodness but really this was the right thing to do"
2262240,2266720," this was the kind thing to do because now instead of letting them believe"
2266720,2270240," that you think they got a large number of orders i mean from who"
2270240,2273920," obviously only from intel you know now i can explain"
2273920,2278160," why you tripped over that so i actually did you a kindness"
2278160,2280560," wow thank you you're welcome yeah yeah"
2280560,2281520," yeah"
2281520,2287840," anyways all three major gpu brands are now contracting tsmc silicon"
2287840,2292640," for their gpu's but it also means that intel hasn't give up given up on a"
2292640,2297040," second generation of graphis cards as was me previously reported"
2297040,2300080," huh i said that one wasn't me what one wasn't hasn't give up"
2300080,2302960," did i say that my bed hasn't given up on a second generation of graphis"
2302960,2306400," cards as was previously reported by you know"
2306400,2310800," some other outlets some people yeah by some by some more this is why"
2310800,2316480," and there's no point singling out anybody yeah but this is why we tend to"
2316480,2321920," not really report rumor as not as big of a fan of"
2321920,2326800," thing that's going to happen yeah my my tendency is like well we'll"
2326800,2330560," occasionally say okay yeah this this is leaked or this is this"
2330560,2333920," looks like it could be shaping up to something"
2333920,2338000," but there are there are certain outlets that have a tendency"
2338000,2343040," to report these things as on the spectrum of fact and fiction"
2343040,2348000," a lot closer to fact and uh we're just kind of of the mind like"
2348000,2352880," we'll review it when it gets here because unless it's something that you can buy"
2352880,2356480," there's not really a whole lot that matters that we can say about it right"
2356480,2361600," now but it looks like if these again i mean this is a rumor"
2361600,2365360," but industry rumors of of large orders being placed"
2365360,2370080," don't come from don't come from nowhere whereas rumors of"
2370080,2373280," um you know this entire division is going to be shut down"
2373280,2377600," can come from just you know people's anxiety or whatever else but orders or"
2377600,2380880," orders and if this order went through it looks like"
2380880,2385840," intel is gonna stay the course and battle made in celestial are going to come in"
2385840,2390080," 2024 and 2026 respectively and hopefully"
2390080,2394240," do something about the way that Nvidia is just"
2394240,2399200," dictating the pricing of GPUs it's it's surprising to me because for a while i"
2399200,2404000," felt like they did see consoles as a a threat"
2404000,2409360," and like i felt like that was what they were attacking with 30 series"
2409360,2413440," but now it feels like they're just kind of sitting there going"
2413440,2421120," they'll pay and if they won't pay today then they'll pay in a generation or two"
2421120,2428000," when our like mainstream entry level GPU is on par with these consoles anyway"
2428000,2432080," and it's they're just like they're playing this this waiting game"
2432080,2435840," where eventually they will produce something at a price"
2435840,2440000," and performance level that is attractive enough for you to upgrade"
2440000,2444400," i the intel cards are like when we did our challenge"
2444400,2448080," it was pretty okay for a first attempt yeah"
2448080,2451200," it wasn't perfect but it's a first gen product yeah that's you're always going"
2451200,2455920," to have some problems and it got a lot better it got way better over time"
2455920,2459840," those driver upgrades were big yep and a lot of the issues that i had at"
2459840,2465120," least are solvable 100 so like if they if they keep the path"
2465120,2468640," it could it could be i have absolutely not lost faith in intel"
2468640,2472480," GPUs i think their biggest problem right now is just that they need"
2472480,2476320," resizable bar in order to perform anywhere near half decent yeah it's a"
2476320,2482000," little wacky and the positioning of a 750 and a 770"
2482000,2487360," would make it perfect for like 69 dollar gaming pc upgrades you know"
2487360,2493120," buying an office tower off of ebay and turning it into a cheap game"
2493120,2497440," none of those are going to support rebar yep so it's like it's the perfect"
2497440,2502960," product for for a hypothetical customer that doesn't exist right yeah"
2502960,2508320," yeah and it's frustrating but down the line"
2508320,2511280," yeah maybe it shifts a little bit yeah we've we've"
2511280,2515680," before we even tried them before they were actual cards that people could even"
2515680,2518080," use but we had already been saying that the"
2518080,2522160," ones to be more excited for was balam agent celestial"
2522160,2526480," and then we tried it and we were like yeah kind of what we said before"
2526480,2530560," we've always we've had this joke for like actually the greater part of 10 years"
2530560,2534160," about how we should have we ever done it we should just do a gpu review before"
2534160,2537920," the gpu comes out yeah yeah you know that literally"
2537920,2542240," was a suggestion that luke made i think about nine years ago yeah"
2542240,2547600," i think you pitched it as an april fools maybe where we upload a review of a gpu"
2547600,2552800," just completely straight-faced yeah graphs and everything yeah"
2552800,2557600," just based on like okay we know they're going to jack the price by fifty two"
2557600,2560400," hundred dollars we know they over overstate the"
2560400,2563280," performance by a little bit yeah stuff like that"
2563280,2567680," yeah we like invent a couple of like kind of cool"
2567680,2571600," technologies or something that seem kind of feasible i got to say fact has"
2571600,2575360," become stranger than fiction like i don't think you can't trust videos or"
2575360,2578720," photos we wouldn't know i i mean in terms of like gpu features"
2578720,2583520," oh yeah back then would i have would i have come up with frame gen"
2583520,2587840," or like even ansel probably not yeah right or like uh"
2587840,2592240," oh shoot what's the remix what what's the one where you can take older games and"
2592240,2597360," and oh yeah i don't know what you're talking about i think it's remix i"
2597360,2601120," i wouldn't have i wouldn't have even made i would have even invented that"
2601120,2605920," um so it's all it's all really cool stuff it's just i can think of things"
2605920,2609920," right now i think from a purely performance standpoint"
2609920,2614800," we probably wouldn't be that far off yeah i don't know if i was cynical"
2614800,2621040," enough to think it could go this bad that's the only thing that i think would"
2621040,2625760," keep us from being very very accurate yeah i just like i think a lot of our"
2625760,2629120," predictions on how this intel gpu thing was going to go was like"
2629120,2631760," actually pretty good yeah i don't know the thing about"
2631760,2635280," predictive content is there's going to be a number of people that are going to"
2635280,2638960," just be super mad about it and it's all it has it has all the exact same"
2638960,2642240," problems as rumors which is why we've never done it well no we have done it"
2642240,2644960," i don't know if you remember this i'm not sure if you were really on the"
2644960,2648800," content side anymore at this point but we did a"
2648800,2653680," review of an upcoming really exciting entry level cpu"
2653680,2657680," by taking the mid tier or the high-end one or something like that oh and just"
2657680,2661600," like artificially limiting it in the bios we disabled the cores we set the"
2661600,2666960," turbos and we were like here's our preview preview preview"
2666960,2671120," well i think of it and people were so mad and the best part"
2671120,2674880," is that once the real product came out"
2674880,2678240," and we were like spot on bang on yeah"
2678240,2681200," correct you still shouldn't have done that"
2681200,2684960," okay but we but we were very clear about what we were doing it wasn't just it"
2684960,2689360," wasn't just rumor mill random guessing it was an educated guess and it was"
2689360,2692240," interesting i'm sure you're aware of this but i'm not necessarily sure that they"
2692240,2697360," are and i don't think we did this but i know back in the day that publications"
2697360,2701600," would do official reviews of cpu's that way"
2701600,2706080," i know that like tom's used to take engineering samples and do reviews early"
2706080,2710080," like that but i don't know if anyone doing that i remember reports of sites"
2710080,2713600," chopping off cores and stuff to represent lower end cpu's that they were not"
2713600,2715920," able to get their hands on because they would have had to like buy it or"
2715920,2720960," whatever this totally that's hilarious is a long time ago i don't remember very"
2720960,2724080," very long time ago over ten years type of stuff but i"
2724080,2727600," remember that happening um"
2727600,2730800," that's awesome brutal"
2730800,2736240," anyways in summary intel arc battle mage sounds good and i'm excited i'm"
2736240,2740400," actually very happy about that because i i ended the intel thing like kind of"
2740400,2742640," frustrated with some of the problems that i had but very hopeful for the"
2742640,2745040," future and a bunch of people were saying like oh no"
2745040,2747200," they're not going to do it so i'm happy that they are going to do it yeah"
2747200,2750160," confirmed confirmed intel gpu division is going away"
2750160,2754720," yeah no i don't think so most of what intel has shut down in their"
2754720,2759680," restructuring has been um less promising"
2759680,2765040," technologies should we talk about this yeah i think we probably should"
2765040,2769120," uh here let's get the luke let's get the luke cam going here"
2769120,2772320," you'll have to lift it up a little bit higher it's"
2772320,2778080," we shot a short today right before the wandshow that is kind of um"
2778080,2782400," inspired by that scene in office space where they beat the crap out of the"
2782400,2785200," printer um do you want to explain what you're holding"
2785200,2788800," there luke yeah careful not to sneeze our that was yeah that was all the"
2788800,2793840," fragments of the m.2 ssd"
2793840,2801120," it's it doesn't really exist anymore it got obliterated um the m.2 ssd you say"
2801120,2806480," yeah so from the from the infected computer uh we're going to save the"
2806480,2809600," motherboard there's like there's like some percentage of"
2809600,2814080," concern that it could have gotten a a something in the bios uh so we're going"
2814080,2816960," to deal with the bios and move on save the motherboard"
2816960,2820320," but the ssd was a was a no save so it got curse"
2820320,2827120," machered um and it was fun i i just sent it with a"
2827120,2832400," bat into effectively bricks on the ground uh and that didn't feel very good"
2832400,2834960," and then i reacted very negatively about that"
2834960,2838240," and then dan runs up and is like all right"
2838240,2841280," time for me to go and just does the exact same thing"
2841280,2846720," looks plain it up it's fine and now my hand still hurts"
2846720,2850800," see i played baseball as a kid i knew it was gonna hurt so like i didn't play"
2850800,2854160," baseball but i knew it was gonna hurt yeah but like the thing is you can like"
2854160,2857760," you can hold it real tight and that makes it okay"
2857760,2863200," it yeah like it you know i know yeah um so when i"
2863200,2867280," i've watched you like harming yourself i'm kind of like"
2867280,2871440," you know for somebody so athletic uh i never played baseball yeah no no i"
2871440,2876320," see that i generally never did yeah i know i could tell"
2876320,2881040," i wasn't like that it did hurt though i mean there's there's"
2881040,2884240," there's video evidence of how how upset luke was and"
2884240,2888240," oh it hurt i mean i have like broken like popped blood vessels yeah no i"
2888240,2893040," believe you because you went hard and the thing is like no matter how"
2893040,2896640," jacked your arms are or whatever it's not like"
2896640,2899680," the blood vessels in your hand and you're still dealing with the like shock or"
2899680,2904000," any stronger so okay the reason why i went so hard was because"
2904000,2908240," it we just originally had it like laying flat on a brick so i was like hitting"
2908240,2911040," this with a bat like nothing's really gonna happen to it yeah but i still"
2911040,2916160," wanted something to happen to it and then i missed yeah"
2916160,2923920," and like the best part is is luke looking at the drive"
2923920,2930480," after going like did i even hit it and there's this dark red mark on the"
2930480,2934560," brick like three four inches away i'm like"
2934560,2938880," no i don't i didn't see that because it was so far away from the drive which"
2938880,2942960," was even even better but that yeah eventually we like"
2942960,2946480," stood it on its end and then you hit it a little harder and then"
2946480,2950640," kind of stomped on it and stuff and now it now it has ceased to exist"
2950640,2954080," yeah it'll so that drive will never harm anybody again"
2954080,2959200," no realistically it is possible that we could have reformatted it and reused"
2959200,2966640," it's worth it's a 256 gig what is that a p5 or something like that crucial p5"
2966640,2972320," that that's what we use as our standard workstation drive and it's like"
2972320,2979120," for the amount of work and the amount of cost if whatever malware that's on"
2979120,2984880," there um whatever malware that's on there if it's"
2984880,2988160," somehow managed to get like recall or whatever yeah into the firmware or"
2988160,2992080," something i i don't know it is"
2992080,2996720," implausible right it probably didn't but it is not"
2996720,2999920," impossible it's it's it's actually like because"
2999920,3004320," we had some like tracking on its actions while it was on the computer and stuff"
3004320,3008800," it's like extremely unlikely that it did"
3008800,3013680," but it's non-zero yeah so like the motherboard we're going to"
3013680,3017840," be saved that it didn't get into the bios um and we're going to keep the"
3017840,3020720," board because it's like even if even if it did get in the boss we can save it"
3020720,3025040," yeah we need to talk about some of the changes that you're going to make as cto"
3025040,3029120," uh luke had a little freak out over our standardized workstations"
3029120,3033360," for everyone that's okay so you have to understand that there's a lot of people"
3033360,3037360," that you don't see on camera all the time that do work that is like"
3037360,3043120," genuinely just in a browser like we we make this meme about like really high-end"
3043120,3046400," gaming pcs uses facebook machines it's effectively"
3046400,3050720," that but like worse because they have"
3050720,3054320," eight hundred dollar motherboards i think there's 600"
3054320,3058640," i don't are they i think so i get a range um a"
3058640,3063920," sus z six ninety ws or something like that pro art yeah pro art z six ninety"
3063920,3068720," creator what's what's one of these worth it's also possible that the prices"
3068720,3071760," are jacked up now six hundred and eighty dollars"
3071760,3075760," okay but on amazon dot c_a_ it's four hundred and seventy seven"
3075760,3079920," canadian oh i'm looking at six hundred and eighty"
3079920,3084560," canadian uh i don't know what to tell you here"
3084560,3089840," uh i mean here's here's my screen well look at the wrong one"
3089840,3093840," uh yeah okay only one left in stock yeah whereas"
3093840,3096480," oh you're looking at the a you're looking at the rise in one"
3096480,3100640," they're no we don't have rise words okay i i think we're lga seventeen hundred"
3100640,3104240," right now because uh rise in seven didn't make sense"
3104240,3108240," when we did our last standardization or something something i can't remember"
3108240,3113440," either way they're pretty a business computer including mine"
3113440,3117120," like when this all happened i looked through the window of mine and was like"
3117120,3122160," what like why do i need this why don't i need an eight hundred"
3122160,3126320," dollar i show up to work i open up my multiple browsers because i have a"
3126320,3129760," bunch of different browsers different profiles it's all cool i like how it's"
3129760,3132720," set up and then i have my different chat programs and that's"
3132720,3136880," all i do i was laughing at work the other day because i i came in and needed to"
3136880,3139520," have a meeting right away and my yeah i was doing this really long windows"
3139520,3143200," update and i was like what the and then it finally finished and i got in and i"
3143200,3147760," didn't realize until like five p.m. it had updated to windows 11"
3147760,3153920," i had no idea because all i do is like use my browsers and other stuff like i'm"
3153920,3160880," not i don't need an eight hundred dollar motherboard there's no way i will"
3160880,3164720," tell you this i will tell you that while i didn't"
3164720,3171600," spec these i did sign off on them but i was i was"
3171600,3174720," asked do you want everyone to have 10 gig"
3174720,3178960," because there are a lot of people that do access the server"
3178960,3184080," for stuff and i was like i don't know we sunk cost fallacy we already invested"
3184080,3187200," in 10 gig infrastructure everywhere version of sunk cost"
3187200,3190320," hold on hold on no that's the sunk cost fallacy"
3190320,3194000," we were already in it we're already in it for 10 gig infrastructure everywhere we"
3194000,3198080," might as well have 10 gig capable clients so i was like uh sure"
3198080,3201040," because 10 gig cards aren't actually that expensive anymore yeah okay here so i"
3201040,3204720," want to add this in as well yeah we have 800 dollar motherboards no no but you"
3204720,3210240," keep saying 800 but okay 650 477 whatever the price that i got from the"
3210240,3213520," person who buys them internally yeah was 600 to 800"
3213520,3216880," okay so that's where we've been buying them so i don't care what their"
3216880,3219760," current cost is yeah because what we spent on them"
3219760,3223440," is around that amount now hold on now let me let me jump in here"
3223440,3228480," my understanding when i signed off on them was that a sus was giving us a"
3228480,3232720," sweetheart of a deal on them though okay sure so my understanding was that we"
3232720,3236000," weren't paying that much for them now what i don't know"
3236000,3241760," is if that deal continued in perpetuity or if we have just been buying and if"
3241760,3246000," we like had to use them for all of the systems because again you know what if"
3246000,3249520," you have some argument for the video editors because they need cranked out"
3249520,3252320," machines right like okay i don't maybe there's some"
3252320,3255360," feature on this board maybe they need 10 gig because they're pulling huge"
3255360,3258400," video files off the servers all this type of stuff there's arguments that i"
3258400,3262320," feel like could be made here are you getting for the cfo job no but keeping"
3262320,3266400," budgets under control is like a thing that matters for everyone not just the"
3266400,3271520," cfo anyways um also gonna say yeah but but we have"
3271520,3276960," so few like spare systems yeah that jaden's talking in float"
3276960,3281360," plane chat about how he was working off a steam deck for a"
3281360,3287440," while okay that had to be voluntary no shut up and it only has one"
3287440,3291760," monitor output no he's working off of a nuk no i mean we"
3291760,3296640," have other no we have like random mini p like there's a mini oh yeah maybe we"
3296640,3299760," have a shelf of servers whatever yeah i mean"
3299760,3303440," okay well what are you doing to fix it i'm gonna be doing something"
3303440,3308320," i'm trying to work slowly through this giant insane pile of mess yeah yeah"
3308320,3312080," and why was a windows 11 update allowed to randomly apply to one of our"
3312080,3315760," computers don't you have any policies we're gonna have to look at policies in"
3315760,3318240," place that is actually something i wondered about"
3318240,3322320," sounds like is does does our antivirus solution work just as well in each one"
3322320,3326160," i don't know this is something that it has now been flagged because my"
3326160,3329520," computer just randomly updated and i was like wow that doesn't seem"
3329520,3335520," right we have outgrown our cavalier approach to"
3335520,3341840," infrastructure management yeah the thing is that in the early days"
3341840,3346880," it was mostly just a bunch of tech bros who were pretty much expected to"
3346880,3351760," perform all their own system maintenance so i mean i i'm not and i'm not gonna say"
3351760,3354800," it was a bad thing for us to standardize our workstations"
3354800,3358560," it actually does make life easier should the workstations have been"
3358560,3361600," standardized on the particular components that they"
3361600,3365520," maybe not there were times that i made calls to just"
3365520,3368400," go with the standard component versus one that we could get a deal on"
3368400,3372400," like fantech we use the p 400 a i think it is"
3372400,3377200," for our standard workstations and fantechs was giving us like a a wild deal on"
3377200,3380800," them for a long time and then they were like you know what you guys are"
3380800,3385520," like you need way too many you need you need pallets of cases on a regular"
3385520,3389360," basis how are you hiring so many people um that's fair okay you're just gonna"
3389360,3393680," have to like buy you're just gonna have to buy cases and i was like"
3393680,3398400," Corsair wanted to play ball and send us cases but i made the call to just buy"
3398400,3400720," the fantechs once not because the Corsair case"
3400720,3405680," isn't as good in fact the 4,000d was i think the most popular case in"
3405680,3409920," intel extreme tech upgrades great case the reason i made the call was the whole"
3409920,3413840," point of the standardized workstations is that when someone's"
3413840,3417120," motherboard dies you get like trained on that thing and then get really fast"
3417120,3420320," with it and stuff you're just going you're going in"
3420320,3424000," out with every we just know everything about it it's good to go"
3424000,3428000," don't have to think about it parts are easily swappable from one to the other"
3428000,3431680," that was the whole point so i was like no we'll just buy cases whatever if it"
3431680,3434560," comes to that and it came to that and that's fine"
3434560,3441120," um whether that motherboard was what made the most sense i don't know"
3441120,3445840," um but i was busy and colton was supposed to do it"
3445840,3450880," this this lines up a lot of the problems here's the bus here's colton"
3450880,3455360," yeah anyways a lot of the problems here come down to like"
3455360,3461200," yeah it was like sort of sort of done someone was working on it and then"
3461200,3464880," you know had to make videos or something yeah and now we're here"
3464880,3468400," yeah i mean that that really is it so everyone kind of was in the early days"
3468400,3471440," was expected to manage their own stuff it didn't matter if anything was"
3471440,3475920," standardized because if like ed's editing station died i'd be like"
3475920,3479520," why are you talking to me about it you fix it like yeah go get some new ram or"
3479520,3483200," whatever there's a pile over there but you didn't have an inventory system"
3483200,3486240," there's a tracking for anything back in the very early days"
3486240,3489600," and anyone who wasn't comfortable upgrading their computer a lot of the"
3489600,3494480," time i would just do it yeah so that's not that's not sustainable"
3494480,3498000," anymore uh sushi sent in the floatplane chat asks why does everyone use"
3498000,3501520," desktops still especially with hybrid work environment most orgs give"
3501520,3505360," laptops nowadays that's a good question have you"
3505360,3509120," found laptop reliability to be subpar i found"
3509120,3512800," laptop okay so a lot of this depends on how long you want that device to really"
3512800,3518160," be used for i guess that's fair um and uh some of it also comes into"
3518160,3521760," like if we're allowing people to work from home"
3521760,3525440," uh you know the problem that happened recently with the browser session"
3525440,3527920," hijack yeah if we're allowing people to log into"
3527920,3531600," work accounts on personal computers in order to be able to work at home"
3531600,3535680," that's a huge security concern because of things like browser session hijacks"
3535680,3539360," right what if they're what if their sense is high when they're working because"
3539360,3542400," we have this trained into them but then they open something in their personal"
3542400,3545760," email right and they're or on their personal time"
3545760,3549440," no but that's what i mean sorry it's like it's a saturday and they get an email"
3549440,3551920," and they're like who's this and they open it and then they get a browser session"
3551920,3556000," hijack right and it it maybe has a work account open it or something"
3556000,3559360," right like so having you're kind of saying having that air gap just like"
3559360,3565200," that that physical separation between my work"
3565200,3569200," computer and my everything else float plane has stuff in place for this"
3569200,3572880," right where we have either you need to be working on a separate partition or a"
3572880,3576480," separate drive so you have like a work portion"
3576480,3579840," right um i don't know if people want to do that with all of their home"
3579840,3583120," pcs for us like we send everyone home with ssd's that they have to use for"
3583120,3586880," work like that's maybe not a great solution for everyone"
3586880,3589920," it kind of works for float plane i don't know if it really scales beyond that i"
3589920,3593600," don't think so maybe if people want to work from home if we have like a dedicated"
3593600,3598240," help desk team to manage all that then sure maybe but i don't think that's"
3598240,3601440," happening yeah like it's good there's a bunch of stuff we"
3601440,3606960," we need to figure out but dr o and float plane chat asks also for you vdi types"
3606960,3610560," out there something something horizon software plus support what's the cost"
3610560,3613840," i don't know that's not my question but you know how feasible given the"
3613840,3617520," 10 gig infrastructure would be just going to thin clients"
3617520,3621200," all of my experience with thin clients is extremely negative"
3621200,3625600," yeah that's fair um that's got to have come a long way though with virtualization"
3625600,3628720," being as good as it is so i'm not shooting it down because of exactly"
3628720,3632320," that and it could have not only just come a long way"
3632320,3635200," but it could also be that the implementations that i used were just poorly"
3635200,3637760," done a lot of the versions that i've tried are at like"
3637760,3642720," schools where in in one case i know the it team just"
3642720,3646560," doesn't care at all and in the other case it was"
3646560,3651360," very very low budget because it was like my high school in the boonies"
3651360,3654720," and i know what the tech budget was and it was zero"
3654720,3658560," so so like the fact that it worked at all was pretty sweet"
3658560,3663760," um and that was also a really long time ago at this point so like maybe it's"
3663760,3667840," come really far um but i always hear about problems with it like tons of"
3667840,3670960," problems with it they have thin clients at my hospital"
3670960,3674240," they literally take two minutes to boot yeah like i i hear stuff like this all"
3674240,3677440," the time now is a two-minute boot time really"
3677440,3681680," that big of a problem i mean it's a lot more than those dedicated"
3681680,3685680," machines sitting next to people's desks right now so yeah but is it worth"
3685680,3688960," eight hundred dollar motherboard plus all the other components to say it depends"
3688960,3692080," it might be it might be the cost of those solutions can be extremely high and it"
3692080,3695120," can be ongoing at least that computer i buy it once"
3695120,3699840," yeah and i you know talking about how overkill it is for the tasks that a lot"
3699840,3704160," of these people are doing they can use it for browsing"
3704160,3708000," the internet and checking emails forever"
3708000,3710400," yeah they're gonna work they're gonna work"
3710400,3713120," yeah there's there's just there's things we got to think about"
3713120,3717200," and i don't know it's not like it's going to be i i don't think it's going to be"
3717200,3720240," worth it at all to like replace all these eight hundred dollar motherboards"
3720240,3723840," and attempt to flip them and then deal with the labor cost of uninstalling a"
3723840,3726560," reason like there's no way that's going to work it's also just"
3726560,3732000," inconvenient because there's going to be entire departments that will not"
3732000,3736400," use thin clients no the editing team is not switching to thin clients it would"
3736400,3739280," have to be like two standards really a high spec and a"
3739280,3744000," and a like whatever well i just not even the spec just like if we had"
3744000,3748000," a bunch of people on thin clients yeah like a mixed architecture setup yeah"
3748000,3752320," because there are people here that can be annoying to manage what i absolutely"
3752320,3756880," need a dedicated station oh yeah for sure because you're literally like"
3756880,3760400," the the video editors and stuff are literally like on the edge of performance"
3760400,3763440," they only have to be all the time all the time so yeah they're gonna be"
3763440,3767600," dedicated desktops for sure my workplace has three levels of"
3767600,3773520," specs yeah but okay so okay but what i said was kind of wrong"
3773520,3775680," because he wasn't talking about levels of specs he was talking about"
3775680,3779120," architecture styles yeah having vdi versus having"
3779120,3782240," dedicated desktops at all is what he was talking about yeah not"
3782240,3786320," because even within those you might have different spec levels"
3786320,3790240," so for example anyone in engineering also going to need a dedicated work"
3790240,3793120," station oh then again actually i think that's"
3793120,3797120," an industry that has moved towards virtual desktops"
3797120,3802560," a lot because those professional cards make more sense"
3802560,3806960," on a centralized machine in the way the licensing for the software works"
3806960,3811040," hmm okay i don't know yeah that's it depends it's all stuff to look into but"
3811040,3814000," compared to some of the other things it's not like the highest priority part of"
3814000,3819120," our problem is that what we do is so broad so weird yeah"
3819120,3822800," weird and broad we're not uncommon and a lot of different"
3822800,3827040," uncomments yeah we're not just like a product development"
3827040,3830080," company or like we're not really going to be able to apply"
3830080,3833440," super generic things to a lot of the stuff that we do yeah"
3833440,3838400," but we do need to apply well thought out sensible things that are actually"
3838400,3842560," enforced properly um what are you saying"
3842560,3846640," can you speak plainly i just well like you said before"
3846640,3850480," it's never really been anyone's full-time job yeah so it's just people have"
3850480,3854240," tried to keep the ship moving and the ship has just worked yeah like"
3854240,3857600," high five okay everyone who's been involved in helping out with the"
3857600,3860640," infrastructure over the years whether it's you know"
3860640,3868480," Jamie or Jake or Dan or Anthony or me yes um i don't know you"
3868480,3873280," you mostly actually didn't do that much not a ton i tried and you were like no"
3873280,3876400," i even i remember having a conversation with you about something"
3876400,3879680," explaining that i could do it better and you were like no it's more interesting"
3879680,3888400," for the video if it's like bad and i was like okay whatever"
3888400,3892000," i was right yeah yeah i mean it wasn't you didn't say it that way it was"
3892000,3894480," something along the lines of like you've got it to this point"
3894480,3898480," so the the audience is going to want to see like the the follow through of the"
3898480,3901120," story something like it was more in depth than like it"
3901120,3906640," should be bad but like yeah content content rules a lot of what we do"
3906640,3909680," it really does and some of the drama of the infrastructure has been"
3909680,3912480," valuable moving forward hopefully we can just"
3912480,3915040," make more like this is what we're doing with it stuff"
3915040,3918080," which will also be interesting but we didn't have a good evolution for the"
3918080,3921680," content we didn't have the time or the dedicated"
3921680,3924560," people in order to do that style of content with it"
3924560,3926800," so it was worth doing it the way that we did do it"
3926800,3930960," like everything everything makes sense and it was fun it just can be improved"
3930960,3935920," is is definitely and like i i want to make a couple of things clear"
3935920,3939600," nothing was fake like when we lost the data we lost the data"
3939600,3943920," um yeah but we but we have definitely taken a"
3943920,3948080," i i just like yee-haw you know let's go you only live once"
3948080,3952480," approach to it um it's been a conscious decision"
3952480,3955440," and it's funny because i'll see a lot of criticism"
3955440,3961600," of our approach where people are like this is so stupid it's obviously"
3961600,3966480," they're only doing it because like they're you know they're just"
3966480,3970160," enthusiasts tinkering with this stuff and want to make a video about it"
3970160,3974320," and i'm like well is it stupid or is it the thing you said yeah"
3974320,3978240," stupid like a fox like that's what we that's what we do we just love this"
3978240,3980960," stuff and we're playing with it and yeah we don't know a lot today"
3980960,3986000," but we're gonna know more tomorrow actually jake and i are planning an"
3986000,3989440," update on how everything's running right now because there's been a ton of"
3989440,3991920," changes like you see the server graveyard over"
3991920,3995440," there right uh actually here dan can you show them can you show them the server"
3995440,4000880," graveyard uh there you go oh yeah yeah there's there's um"
4000880,4005440," there's more can you pan up or tilt up rather up up up up up up up"
4005440,4011280," there we go some more servers uh the server graveyard exists because"
4011280,4014400," we've done a lot of consolidation over the last little while yeah what we're"
4014400,4018000," planning to do then is a combination it's going to be two"
4018000,4021840," vlogs i think it's going to be like an update on how everything"
4021840,4025600," works with the three locations that we have now"
4025600,4030240," and uh data data backup and resiliency across those locations"
4030240,4034000," what we're planning for a really cool project that's coming up soon"
4034000,4039840," so we are moving one x server the primary editing NAS slash like main"
4039840,4045200," production NAS to a high availability um solution"
4045200,4050800," so it's going to be using four nodes in a single two-year rack yeah where you"
4050800,4057120," can lose any one node like gone lose and the whole thing just"
4057120,4060960," stays ticking which is which is pretty cool so we're going to talk about that"
4060960,4066080," and then as a follow up we're going to do a video where i switch jobs for a day"
4066080,4071120," the idea is that i work in logistics and we are going to take on the server"
4071120,4073520," graveyard oh we're going to take on some of the"
4073520,4077200," organization challenges we've had over at the new place"
4077200,4080640," i'm going to bring not just me but i'm going to recruit like jake"
4080640,4086240," and as many people will probably bring in dan uh dan by the way okay"
4086240,4089760," sure anyway um so we'll probably bring in dan"
4089760,4092800," and uh we'll have some fun we're just going to go through and like organize"
4092800,4095760," some stuff we haven't done any of that like classic"
4095760,4099040," vloggy style content in a long time so i think it's going to be fun"
4099040,4103280," yeah um on the subject back going back to us talking about how we do so many"
4103280,4107120," different things and it's all sort of broad and random"
4107120,4112240," uh this is a question over on twitch that one wolf asks sorry if this comes out"
4112240,4116720," as naive but i do genuinely wonder what does lmg do as a whole"
4116720,4120320," the company i know you're a tech company but what do you do"
4120320,4123760," oh besides making youtube videos reviewing products"
4123760,4128080," selling your merch but what else just like for example samsung they sell"
4128080,4132080," tech like smartphones etc but what is lmg's product thanks in"
4132080,4136160," advance our product is what you said well hold on"
4136160,4141440," yeah sort of i mean because we have we have a bit of a problem"
4141440,4145600," what what do we call ourselves we're a media company yeah"
4145600,4149920," sort of we're well okay so completely not at all we're new"
4149920,4154800," we look at it in a different sort of well okay we're"
4154800,4158960," it depends even youtube wasn't sure how to categorize us"
4158960,4166000," yeah like i have so go for it i have a representative from youtube"
4166000,4171520," who's a creator representative but it was apparently debated internally"
4171520,4175760," switching me over to more like a corporate representative"
4175760,4179520," so the kind of representative that would work with okay yeah because we're a big"
4179520,4183760," company like a media company yeah um and i was sitting here going"
4183760,4187040," no i'm pretty sure that i'm still"
4187040,4189920," involved enough on the content and being the"
4189920,4195200," personality on camera side of things that i am definitely still a youtuber"
4195200,4199520," i'm not like a like a five-minute crafts or like i agree with that i"
4199520,4202400," understand why they had the debate whatever else but i"
4202400,4207120," but i get it yeah because it makes sense because yeah even youtube wasn't sure"
4207120,4211600," like what the heck we were because i mean because it's not because it's also"
4211600,4215200," a lot of youtubers they would just talk to the youtuber"
4215200,4218640," whereas our poor our poor youtube rep who"
4218640,4224720," i i'm usually very nice too but sometimes i just i just get like"
4224720,4229200," really passionate about stuff sometimes and i love our youtube rep but"
4229200,4234080," i feel like she is a hard time processing my energy"
4234080,4237440," sometimes and so i think it i think it i think it's"
4237440,4240320," tough for i think it's tough for her sometimes"
4240320,4243600," and i feel especially bad for her because she's like"
4243600,4248160," nine contacts here depending on whether it's you know content related or"
4248160,4251280," merch related or editing related like whatever right"
4251280,4254880," so it's really tough and she's not really set up for that"
4254880,4258640," so so the problem that i was talking about which is not actually the same"
4258640,4262000," problems that you're talking about but is heavily related is we don't actually"
4262000,4265360," have an actual name because we are not"
4265360,4270320," lionis media group that is wrong"
4270320,4275600," uh no yeah i mean no you're no you're right"
4275600,4280480," oh yeah like yes you're right but no yeah yeah yeah"
4280480,4284480," i don't know what to call it i don't know either i i forget the umbrella"
4284480,4288400," company is called like bcltd it's a bunch of numbers and stuff"
4288400,4291680," 225 something like i i don't know evan named it"
4291680,4295920," before i told her hey we should probably give kind of distinctive sounding names"
4295920,4298960," to all the companies and she's like what's not distinctive about"
4298960,4305200," and like rattles off nine digits and i'm sitting here going woman"
4305200,4309280," i barely know my own phone number"
4309280,4317760," oh man uh yeah but i don't even know so it's a mix we're trying to do yeah"
4317760,4320800," infrastructure okay but that doesn't work either i don't get into that in a"
4320800,4323920," second but we're trying to do like infrastructure stuff here"
4323920,4327600," and and this isn't even something we're working on but just this is my best"
4327600,4333280," example for it yeah so if you're doing building access"
4333280,4338080," what is the domain for people to gain building access i don't know"
4338080,4342240," oh whatever it ends up being let's just say we name it after the parent"
4342240,4347920," company lmg but that's not right because what if you only work at creator"
4347920,4351280," warehouse you enter a building that is only for creator warehouse"
4351280,4356720," why are you putting that one in that's weird yeah it's like"
4357360,4363120," i don't know it's weird"
4363120,4368320," yeah i think we've just got to go and people are like oh you're like a"
4368320,4372480," tech lifestyle company i'm like yeah the like giant lab with a power supply"
4372480,4376640," tester that's taller than you are is tech lifestyle yeah not really no not"
4376640,4381120," really and then labs we made the we made the decision i think mostly because"
4381120,4383760," yvonne doesn't feel like admitting another company"
4383760,4387920," uh we made the decision to not spin labs off such as to a separate company"
4387920,4390400," that was under the umbrella but not everything else that was like this"
4390400,4394000," media group you start adding slashes so you were like oh it's just a combination"
4394000,4403440," with them okay so it's lmg cw lab fupa and then what if we add badminton"
4403440,4406560," and then what if we add something else yeah so like eventually it's just going to be"
4406560,4411120," like a bunch of random letters with slashes between it like that's"
4411120,4415680," let me talk about the badminton center because so this is more of a personal"
4415680,4420400," side project for me though i mean what isn't i guess at this point in time"
4420400,4424720," uh the so the badminton center we were trying to figure out how to handle the"
4424720,4427760," accounting please don't just put your name at the"
4427760,4431360," front of whatever the hell it is is i don't know no no we'll talk about that later"
4431360,4434320," in the show actually because i was going to solicit your advice"
4434320,4439760," or how to how to name the the badminton center so we'll talk about that later but"
4439760,4444000," um we were trying to figure out because if we're going to have a center we're"
4444000,4447520," going to need a pro shop and if we're going to have a pro shop"
4447520,4451600," and we already know everything we know about online commerce"
4451600,4455440," why don't we just have a webshop and if we're going to have a webshop"
4455440,4457760," well why don't we just ship to all the same"
4457760,4461840," regions we should review badminton equipment as and then we should add"
4461840,4467520," stuff in the lab to check like tensile strength of strings and"
4467520,4472800," durability of different rackets yes not that okay good but we were trying to"
4472800,4476400," figure out how to handle the if so if if creator warehouse"
4476400,4481040," just uses all of its knowledge and expertise to run the webshop sure just"
4481040,4486720," add another shop i sort right how does the accounting work for that"
4486720,4490880," i have no idea"
4490880,4493040," i don't know"
4496240,4501760," it's actually way more complicated than people probably think"
4501760,4504240," because you can't just like do stuff for free"
4504240,4507200," no and if it's a different company like"
4507200,4511840," that's not your job yeah so then you have to like you have to contract it"
4511840,4514880," but then when i say that you can't just do stuff for free"
4514880,4518800," i mean legally yeah you literally can't you can't"
4518800,4522720," yeah creator warehouse can't just do"
4522720,4528960," linus badminton coz accounting for it yeah that's not how that works yeah"
4528960,4532960," so they would have to build them but then hold on a second who owns the"
4532960,4537360," who holds the inventory who actually issues the p.o and if it's creator"
4537360,4541600," warehouse that holds the inventory then are they just an unnecessary"
4541600,4547200," middle entity between actual distributors and the pro shop which is going to"
4547200,4550000," operate physically and it's going to have to collect"
4550000,4554160," canadian currency you run could you run like a whereas creator warehouse"
4554160,4558560," only collects us currency right now in order to make it not a complete cluster"
4558560,4564400," f*ck it's so good so good you could maybe do i know"
4564400,4568320," back in the day geese squad used to operate out of"
4568320,4572800," best buy but was a separate company right so could it be like"
4572800,4577040," creator warehouse is pro shop and they like pay the badminton company rent"
4577040,4582160," i don't know is that easier is that good use of creator warehouses time"
4582160,4588240," so if linus the ceo creator warehouse comes in and is like hey i have like a"
4588240,4593120," little personal project that is never going to make any money"
4593120,4596160," um why don't you dedicate a bunch of time to that"
4596160,4600480," oh your kpi's that actually matter uh yeah you're still going to have to do"
4600480,4604560," those things anyway but i also do them like it doesn't make sense"
4604560,4608160," yeah you can't do that yeah so we're gonna have to figure out"
4608160,4614000," what that's gonna say yeah um very cool let's talk about the name"
4614000,4620400," yeah do you have any ideas uh yes okay sweet i"
4620400,4627360," asked chat gpt i said i'm probably pretty generic did you feed it like some"
4627360,4632480," yeah well what i did was i i fed it a couple i well i asked it"
4632480,4635600," what's a good name for a badminton racket club"
4635600,4639440," and then from there it gave me some ideas and i said i kind of like this one this"
4639440,4641840," one this one and this one can you give me some more suggestions like that"
4641840,4646000," okay good you and then i kind of went i don't like this one or this one"
4646000,4649520," negative props are very helpful these are kind of long can you give me"
4649520,4651520," stuff that's shorter and"
4651520,4659440," did you pace them no i'm not sure if you're gonna i'm not so so we actually kind of"
4659440,4663440," kind of settled on something i kind of like it but"
4663440,4667280," mate okay you know what i want to call it smash club"
4667280,4672320," oh no i love that okay i'm so down is that not taken already"
4672320,4675360," it might be we haven't done a trademark search or anything like that but i kind"
4675360,4680240," of want to call it smash club please let me okay please you don't have to"
4680240,4687040," yeah but please in the like waiting room yeah one of the couches rule number oh"
4687040,4692160," yes one of the couches we need to have a tv"
4692160,4698640," and just smash bros no other game so you went there with it yeah see no i get it"
4698640,4701680," i get it i get it no no i went i went like fight club"
4701680,4705680," oh yeah like rule number one is you do talk about smash club your word of"
4705680,4708400," mouth referrals mean a lot to us you know whatever else"
4708400,4712720," but where i was actually going with it is i think it's a really funny double on"
4712720,4717360," tandra i just think it's a good name to be as straight up i just think it's a"
4717360,4721920," good name so you still haven't gotten to like"
4721920,4725760," smash club that's where i thought luke was going with it"
4725760,4730960," in the lobby with the couch you know oh no no i black couch"
4730960,4735040," yeah what kind of couches this i'm with you guys i got all three of those okay"
4735040,4738640," all right i'm just trying to figure out how we can get the domain"
4738640,4743120," because i'm so down did you get the domain you know so how can you say this"
4743120,4746960," publicly without getting the domain"
4746960,4751120," brother smash brother"
4751120,4761680," can so no i want we should do this can oh i don't know if my it might not be"
4761680,4764480," possible anyway it says to brackets by day"
4764480,4769600," swingers club by night right so oh did i tell you my idea of putting"
4769600,4773200," black lights over some of the courts and doing like"
4773200,4778560," disco badminton or you know like like blacklight paint the tips of the"
4778560,4781920," the shuttles oh i don't think you'd have to they're white"
4781920,4785440," they might glow anyway yeah they'd be sweet oh you could definitely use like"
4785440,4789120," the plastic like the nylon shuttles those yellow ones would almost"
4789120,4794960," certainly flores whoa yeah yeah um so yeah i have a little bit more"
4794960,4800880," detail it is likely going to be uh fourteen courts"
4800880,4804560," so it's going to be pretty pretty awesome um"
4804560,4808720," we had uh we had an opportunity to partner with a local club that is"
4808720,4812560," going to run like training programs or that wants to run training programs we"
4812560,4815600," haven't locked down the deal a hundred percent yet but it looks really"
4815600,4819040," promising right now and so there'll be a partnership with them to get"
4819040,4822000," this thing off the ground i'm i'm actually very excited"
4822000,4825440," it's kind of my retirement dream to run a badminton center which isn't to say"
4825440,4830000," i'm retiring um but it'll be done boys it'll be there"
4830000,4834240," smash club i like smash club i actually really like"
4834240,4836960," that name i really wish you didn't say it on the show"
4836960,4839440," i don't know you never know maybe we'll maybe we'll get a deal"
4839440,4844240," because the truth is that i actually have other ideas that i lean towards more"
4844240,4847520," that i am not saying oh okay yeah that was more just like a"
4847520,4850720," joke one if we can get it i just like smash club because even if you"
4850720,4852960," don't look at it from the joking angles and this is"
4852960,4856000," these are always the best names in my opinion there's like a bunch of ways"
4856000,4859920," that it's funny but also a smash is like actually a"
4859920,4863440," a thing well i i also kind of wanted something that fit in with sort of the"
4863440,4867120," theme of all the local clubs so there's drive"
4867120,4871520," there's ace there's clear and there's smash and then and then yeah we'd be"
4871520,4874160," like smash yeah it's pretty sweet whatever yeah i think it's"
4874160,4878240," even i don't think it's even a bad name if you just look at purely seriously"
4878240,4881920," and then it's also funny what i don't like about it is that it's really not a"
4881920,4887440," great domain for a web store smash club.com like to go like shop it"
4887440,4891200," doesn't even it's not self-explanatory oh you don't want the.com the.com is"
4891200,4894480," really expensive oh is it yeah oh do you know"
4894480,4895200," 40 grand"
4895200,4902400," yeah that's not happening i think someone saw it cheaper somewhere else but it was"
4902400,4907520," like 28 grand like it's yeah yeah yeah there's other options for"
4907520,4913360," domains that like could work though yeah so i don't know"
4913360,4917760," yeah we're we're not doing that i you know another idea i had that i thought"
4917760,4920960," would be really funny and again this one is not real we're not"
4920960,4924480," actually going to do this but i was thinking like"
4924480,4928080," like like like what about this"
4929280,4935200," yeah i never know like i was but what i was what i had in mind was like um"
4935200,4938000," i do do do do do do do do do do do do do do"
4938000,4943520," racquet shuttle dot net or something oh because like it racquet shuttle and"
4943520,4947920," and net like it's like it's part of the equipment i don't know i"
4947920,4951280," i just want to have fun with it i just want it to be fun and"
4951280,4956160," the black lights would be so cool for land events"
4956160,4960640," if we did up if we did up the whole place with like uv lighting"
4960640,4965200," and just like it could be pretty sick at like midnight or something"
4965200,4968960," yeah just everything goes like black light for the rest of the night"
4968960,4973040," what's like a neon inspired land game there's got to be something i don't know"
4973040,4977360," i mean yeah hard to say halo starts at midnight"
4977360,4980640," even though it's it's not really i don't know not really but like"
4980640,4983600," there's some covenant stuff that's kind of like that but like halo starts at"
4983600,4987200," midnight and everyone knows because the like main lights go out black lights"
4987200,4990880," come on everyone jumps on halo se vocal servers like"
4990880,4994720," oh that's something we've got to figure out"
4994720,4998720," we need to have like a giant projector setup that's just like sort of"
4998720,5002160," permanently set up by the stage or something"
5002160,5004960," oh i hadn't really thought of that because the walls are going to have to be"
5004960,5008960," blue or green so that you have enough contrast for"
5008960,5011680," for the shuttle it's like for during the actual use the"
5011680,5016000," facilities actually you should paint them in like a blue and green"
5016000,5021040," like blue and green screen paint um yes and no"
5021040,5024560," it would not work properly yeah you want it to be a little more washed out"
5024560,5026720," than that okay it shouldn't be quite that vibrant"
5026720,5029920," it's a little hard on the nice yeah that's fair but we'll have to figure out"
5029920,5032880," something we'll have to figure out some way to do like a giant projector screen"
5032880,5036320," so we just be like yeah here's you know here's the"
5036320,5040480," directory that you definitely shouldn't go to to"
5040480,5045040," how did that get there not get any you know copies of games or whatever that"
5045040,5048240," doesn't happen at lands that's not a thing uh so you know"
5048240,5051440," put that up and then instructions or whatever else like"
5051440,5055440," halo come halo custom edition for example has this annoying bug where if you"
5055440,5059360," don't install this like weird obscure old windows patch"
5059360,5064000," the kill feed doesn't work yeah yeah and that sucks you want the kill feed and"
5064000,5067760," halo at a land that is not cool yeah you want to"
5067760,5070560," dunk on each other and then if we do any like little mini tournaments or whatever"
5070560,5073680," you want to be able to throw it up on the projector if you can"
5073680,5081040," hold on a second okay ah ah just like i'm full of ideas today"
5081040,5085840," what if we had like a main stage where all we have is keyboard mice and"
5085840,5092080," keyboards mice and monitors and optical display port and usb connections"
5092080,5096320," so that anyone with their rig to jack into your actual personal rig"
5096320,5102320," and they go play on the stage or like or we could or or alternately"
5102320,5107440," we could jack into 16 or however many like five by five or"
5107440,5111760," eight versus eight we could jack into them and we could display every one even"
5111760,5116320," need you could let people i think people hauling their keyboard"
5116320,5118880," mouse wouldn't be a problem people hauling their monitors is going to get a"
5118880,5122240," little ridiculous but if you if you if you let them bring their own keyboard"
5122240,5126560," or mouse yeah so just take your keyboard mouse whatever take seconds"
5126560,5129840," and then we have this setup that's mostly there and then you can crank it out up"
5129840,5132080," on stage if all we needed was the spectating"
5132080,5134880," then you could just probably do something over ndi"
5134880,5138560," and capture that way um and we could have definitely ways we could pull off of"
5138560,5141840," their systems if you wanted the people up on stage yeah but but"
5141840,5146000," if you wanted the teams like facing each other like at a real esports event"
5146000,5150640," even if it's just randoms right i think it'd be way more fun if you just"
5150640,5156960," had like a like a main stage you know match place and people would go up"
5156960,5161760," there so you like just start up yeah you know like it's it's too much fun you"
5161760,5165840," got you want that energy right so when i chatted do a proper land instead"
5165840,5169040," like quake land i've never done quake land personally"
5169040,5172640," what do you mean by proper land instead the whale land that we just did"
5172640,5177520," was exactly to a tee how i like wands to go"
5177520,5184080," yeah lands to go not wands um and i hope that they will stay similar to that"
5184080,5188960," a proper land is whatever you decide it is is whatever it's whatever is fun"
5188960,5192720," it's getting together with your homies and playing video games like the things"
5192720,5195920," that there's no such thing as a proper land the things that we're against is"
5195920,5198800," like non-participation people sitting around on like"
5198800,5203120," social media networks at a land like no man like let's play some"
5203120,5206400," vidya games play some games it's not about what you play all the time when"
5206400,5209280," you're at home yeah it's about showing up and having fun"
5209280,5212160," playing whatever participation is currently going on"
5212160,5215760," yeah we had the the like real mark of success"
5215760,5219280," of whale land to me was every time that we would do something like"
5219280,5223520," super random just the whole place was up doing oh yeah nobody was at the"
5223520,5227520," we did share curling yeah and like nobody was still playing games i want"
5227520,5231920," to say let's curl some chairs they're all like cheering to ridiculous degrees"
5231920,5235200," and stuff like that was great that was exactly what i'm looking for"
5235200,5242960," yeah 100 percent yeah all right is it time to react"
5242960,5248480," to star forage systems review of the ltt screwdriver i've seen it"
5248480,5252800," oh yep i didn't know we were supposed to not watch it"
5252800,5259840," okay well i guess um i guess i am watching it and"
5259840,5263760," okay sure time hey look at this they have a theater mode"
5263760,5265760," hey float plane should have something like that"
5265760,5268640," i mean if you just make the page bigger it just does it automatically we don't"
5268640,5272320," actually give you a choice you're just in theater mode yeah that's true that is"
5272320,5275280," actually a thing that has on the beta side on the beta side"
5275280,5283040," uh okay so is audio gonna work dan i do oh uh one moment please my uh yeah i"
5283040,5286560," know where it is i'll find every get past the odds you guys being able to"
5286560,5291360," hear this is a bit more complicated oh uh really it might work we'll see"
5291360,5296400," okay good luck everybody we good you're good to play it"
5296400,5302560," on the surface i understand i cannot hear it this is already freaking hilarious"
5302560,5305680," stuff oh you gotta do yourself three of these bad boys"
5305680,5310240," today and you've got uh okay i i will put on closed captions for now"
5310240,5315840," easy right except for a few small problems i mean i don't even need to hear what he's"
5315840,5319680," saying because it's obviously just"
5319680,5323760," there we go but the customers are a nightmare"
5323760,5328240," don't want updates on their order huh don't want it to last a long time"
5328240,5332240," tell me the demand of warranty all of which is why i'm extremely"
5332240,5339520," extremely strong can i say i love this guy right here"
5339520,5344560," not even trying to pretend that he's not having the time of his life right now"
5344560,5346800," hold on"
5346800,5353360," i can't think of it"
5353360,5357840," all of which is why i am extremely skeptical about the survival of ltt store"
5357840,5361520," dot com everything about it screams doomed to fail"
5361520,5365840," between everything about it seems doomed to fail"
5365840,5369120," like the owner being a small tech youtuber with less than 20 million"
5369120,5372000," subscribers the executive team including"
5372000,5376240," okay we can't all be unbox therapy okay some guy who keeps tweeting at us"
5376240,5380160," and the absolute cherry on top is that the launch went so poorly"
5380160,5384480," that the aforementioned small youtuber only launched with two color options"
5384480,5388640," of course i'm fully prepared to put my money where my mouth is and find out"
5388640,5393440," if i'm wrong so we begs Linus am i saying that right"

5398240,5401520," screwdrivers a screwdriver that costs hundreds of"
5401520,5406800," thousands of dollars is it a good deal is it built can it run doom"
5406800,5410160," just maybe they've got what it takes though while we unbox the screwdriver"
5410160,5413040," let's talk more about the ltt store dot com's"
5413040,5416960," unboxing experience right out of the gate okay it's only one"
5416960,5420720," calm okay not ltt store dot coms i just want to jump in and"
5420720,5425440," and and and and correct you there we'll say that"
5425440,5429520," actually this is kind of nice simple sorry what's that"
5429520,5433840," ltt store dot com's unboxing experience i don't know i'm just he's not saying"
5433840,5438160," i'm i'm i'm finding reasons to nitpick this is actually kind of hilarious they"
5438160,5440800," have they've taken pretty much a point for"
5440800,5444240," point um they've they've made a point for point"
5444240,5446960," remake of our review of their system yeah"
5446960,5449280," um"
5449280,5456480," the intro it was hilarious seeing you know what we could do"
5456480,5460160," if we downgraded our cameras spent way less time"
5460160,5464000," and just more straight to do like a while ago"
5464000,5466800," or straight meaning is it's inspirational yeah"
5466800,5472400," elegant not quite as good as a serialized wooden box with a"
5472400,5477440," not quite as good as a serialized wooden box with a handwritten note but"

5481120,5485520," sign of shipping damage however there's no evidence that this"
5485520,5488720," particular unit was tested to be functioning correctly"
5488720,5492720," and that its performance is what is expected for this unit with that out of"
5492720,5495360," the way i guess we can take a little bit closer of a look"
5495360,5500480," through driver um no fans so pretty bad here both of the"
5500480,5507440," work okay and uh i don't know i actually take issue with this"

5543920,5546240," there are that are very difficult to get right"
5546240,5552480," okay can i ask something do i sound like that much of a doucher is he just"
5552480,5556800," taking the p*ck a little bit sometimes oh all right i think in that"
5556800,5561040," situation it was in my opinion fair because you had"
5561040,5565840," literally done that okay like you actually worked it on NCX they did"
5565840,5570320," those things you have had to deal with all those problems so it was like"
5570320,5574640," legitimate okay but you know sometimes"

5636480,5640560," yeah but they know that it's it's the whole the whole that"
5640560,5645040," the back and forth around it not being is like the whole reason in my opinion"

5662560,5667440," yeah yeah yeah i'd be disappointed if they were ever thought of that and thought"
5667440,5670480," about the the like marketing and branding utility"

5785920,5789360," oh i see what you did there in an unreleased game we're not allowed to"
5789360,5792560," refer to by name we finally saw the ltt store.com"
5792560,5795840," screwdriver perform up to par with a gaming pc"

5806160,5810240," you i get it not everybody wants to build and design their own screwdriver"

5849520,5854480," okay all right"
5854480,5858480," all around in six months and you like the youtuber and ltt then this screwdriver"
5858480,5862000," seems like it might be as good an option as any other on the market"
5862000,5867200," of course the best option is always to segue to our sponsor all right all right"
5867200,5871040," all right all right all right all right all right all right all right"
5871040,5878000," guys well played well played oh i didn't even oh i didn't even catch this they"
5878000,5883200," accidentally drop the screwdriver yeah i i 35 seconds"
5883200,5887520," all right well i'm just i'm glad the driver's out there"
5887520,5892720," i'm glad people are enjoying it in more in a on a more serious note"
5892720,5896320," samet who is a youtuber that i hadn't really heard of"
5896320,5902640," until i saw this thumbnail um which is no no we're not gonna watch this one"
5902640,5905760," yeah it's it's 20 minutes long but um i'm"
5905760,5910000," probably supposed to watch one 40 second segment oh okay we can do that"
5910000,5915680," Linus screwed me was what i saw pop up in my in my recommended and i'm sitting"
5915680,5918960," here going excuse me i thought it was gonna be really"
5918960,5923360," bad i thought so too i have actually i haven't finished watching it yet because"
5923360,5926400," people keep walking into my office and interrupting me this is why it's really"
5926400,5929760," hard for me to watch videos even when i want to i've watched about half of it"
5929760,5933360," that was my fault yeah it was no you weren't the only one i sat down and tried to"
5933360,5936800," watch this like four times and i've made it 10 minutes in did you"
5936800,5940080," watch the first half yeah okay cool i strategically"
5940080,5944880," watched the second half oh shut up i did i saw your message saying like i"
5944880,5947920," watched half of it i was like he must have started it so i'll just jump"
5947920,5951040," partway through also your link actually had a time"
5951040,5954480," stamp in it so i'm pretty sure you shared from where you were at nice so i"
5954480,5956720," literally watched from the second that you ended"
5956720,5960960," watching so collectively what a team collectively we have"
5960960,5964000," watched one video"
5964000,5970240," yeah oh no all right so anyway uh i guess there's a segment that we're"
5970240,5973440," supposed to watch please watch and react"
5973440,5978720," 122 to 203 yeah so i actually haven't seen this"
5978720,5981440," oh"
5981440,5989120," from all the bits so i'm going to load this up"
5989120,5992880," that was kind of so fine wait can you flick it"
5992880,6001120," oh my god if you have 80 or 80 HD this is bad do not buy this for your partner"
6001120,6005840," because i'm going to be sitting here all day when i'm just thinking just doing this"
6005840,6013680," how fast can i do it all right anyways let's load this up and let's get"
6013680,6017360," something to compare to wait so it was a false alarm oh my god"
6017360,6024720," the channel oh okay cool cool i can put my hand oh my"
6028240,6032880," that's pretty good strawberries they're everywhere man he realizes later on in"
6032880,6035920," the video that you can just if you hold on to the"
6035920,6039040," shaft you can just spin it and the whole ratchet will twirl around and he's like"
6039040,6042880," oh and he does that for a while too"
6042880,6048720," i can tell when like one of my people yeah gets their hands on the driver"
6048720,6053840," there's a lot of that because i do it all the time yeah all the time"
6053840,6058640," i get i get a no if if my like if my partner ever tries to sort it away"
6058640,6062000," somewhere to put it somewhere that it like should go i always go and get it back"
6062000,6064480," and put it back on my desk because i'll sit there"
6064480,6068880," specifically with my hand in like this position right above where my mouse is"
6068880,6072080," and if i'm thinking i'll just grab it and just spin spin spin"
6072080,6075440," we are working on a fidget toy built with the same ratchet but it's going to"
6075440,6078400," take some time you know it's just everything takes time"
6078400,6083200," especially molding takes time overall what i saw so why don't we compare"
6083200,6086480," notes uh was that he it took him a while to kind of"
6086480,6089440," figure out all the ins and outs it looks like he wanted to just go on his own"
6089440,6093200," voyage of discovery it was pretty fun watching him discover"
6093200,6097760," that the bit loader spins so that you can kind of treat it as a little carousel"
6097760,6100720," to see your bits move it around i know that he had some"
6100720,6105680," constructive feedback on the uh the texture of the plastic"
6105680,6109360," he's not the first to bring it up in fact jake was the first to bring it up"
6109360,6115120," internally uh before launch but the reality of it was at that point"
6115120,6120480," changing the texture of the plastic could have been done"
6120480,6123360," but it was a one-way ticket trouble yeah so"
6123360,6126560," once you because it's some kind of like"
6126560,6130240," electrical obliteration of part of the mold"
6130240,6134880," to change the plastic oh it's called EDM if i recall correctly"
6134880,6142800," um and once you do it it's done those molds were a huge bet"
6142800,6146240," and we had something that had really good part lines"
6146240,6150080," really good hand feel didn't get too scuffed up"
6150080,6155840," or did and then kind of resolved itself it was kind of like a"
6155840,6160000," almost like a self-healing texture and i was sitting here going"
6160000,6166560," okay this checks every other box and we could try to go after this little"
6166560,6171360," extra box did he try using it with gloves i'm not sure"
6171360,6174400," because i know not in the part i watched so i am also"
6174400,6178480," slippery hands boy right and the first time i ever used it i was like oh yeah"
6178480,6181360," this is gonna be a problem if i ever have to do something that takes a lot of"
6181360,6184720," torque right um i've never once had a problem"
6184720,6187920," using it on my own so far and i've like taken things apart"
6187920,6190480," not just computers taking things apart and all those other kind of stuff"
6190480,6194880," but if i was like cranking something in on say a car like even if it could have"
6194880,6198320," been a problem but just to test it i grabbed one of my"
6198320,6201920," pairs of gloves that has like a leather palm right no problems whatsoever"
6201920,6204240," right okay so if you're if you're someone who works with gloves then it's"
6204240,6207680," not an on issue yeah he spoke very highly of"
6207680,6211360," pretty much everything else that i saw really like the hand feel really liked"
6211360,6216240," just the ergonomics of it um it seemed like it exceeded his"
6216240,6219760," expectations which made me really happy because"
6219760,6223680," you know obviously we set out to build a great screwdriver"
6223680,6227360," with building computers particularly in mind but we wanted to be great for"
6227360,6232320," other things so to see car folks come and say like yeah it's really good"
6232320,6235280," for this too is pretty exciting so how was the second half a lot of what he"
6235280,6237600," did in the part that i watched was he just like"
6237600,6241520," went around his shop and just tried it on like everything"
6241520,6245040," he unscrewed and screwed i like his style like uh"
6245040,6248640," one of his tool benches he did it to a bunch of random screws around one of"
6248640,6251280," the the engine base of the car that he was working on"
6251280,6254480," he even went up to his bidet because he's in"
6254480,6258640," Japan right they call them i think they just called him toilet spare thing"
6258640,6261920," else i don't remember what it is yeah he explained that they use a different"
6261920,6264560," name for it but anyways he went up to his bidet and he's like yeah"
6264560,6268800," when we're servicing these we have to like cut off the water"
6268800,6271360," and that works through this like flathead thing"
6271360,6274720," so i'm gonna try to use this for that he did it and it worked perfectly fine"
6274720,6278800," one thing that i noticed in his operation of it is that he he liked the"
6278800,6281840," knurling on the shaft he also pointed that out he really liked the knurling on"
6281840,6285680," the shaft but i found that and this is something that i have to like"
6285680,6290080," almost retrain myself too the back force is so light"
6290080,6293920," that a lot of tasks i'm like trained in my head like oh this is a light one i'm"
6293920,6297760," gonna spin the shaft right you don't have to yeah"
6297760,6302960," but i think he uses this stuff all the time clearly so he has muscle memory of"
6302960,6306000," like oh it's it's a light one i need to go up and do it that way"
6306000,6309200," right when he probably could have just turned it normally and because of the"
6309200,6312480," back force it would have been fine he did notice the back force earlier but"
6312480,6315360," you probably right it's probably just muscle memory i watched him do a bunch of"
6315360,6317920," tasks that i know could have been done that way"
6317920,6321280," yeah but he did it by spinning the which is like it doesn't matter he also might"
6321280,6324800," just be efficiency minded i still use the knurling a lot it's fast even when i"
6324800,6327680," don't have to there's a reason why the knurling's on there yeah i just"
6327680,6330800," yeah like that that stood out to me a little bit uh but yeah i used it for a"
6330800,6336320," ton of things so that he liked it um and he invited you to go to japan"
6336320,6340800," and go drifting with him oh i didn't see that part yeah"
6340800,6344960," i mean that sounds really fun yeah i was going to say he didn't invite me but"
6344960,6347920," if you're not going i'll go"
6347920,6354720," it'll just show up it looks so sick i clicked on one of his other videos just"
6354720,6359840," to like see what they do going drifting in japan is like"
6359840,6363920," that's where you want to go to do it yeah like tokyo yeah you know like where"
6363920,6367200," you tokyo drift well in the in the mountains because of initial"
6367200,6371440," d but yeah i i i don't know that's uh that's super cool"
6371440,6377120," that sounds super fun anyway yeah appreciate the review thank you so much"
6377120,6382880," um oh yeah okay yeah Tim's commenting on the back"
6382880,6389040," force as well on the floatplane chat i didn't know that he was a mechanic"
6389040,6394080," it kind of makes sense though yeah hey we haven't talked about merch"
6394080,6399680," messages at all guys the i mean you found them so that's cool but if"
6399680,6402320," you're new to the show and you don't know what merch messages are we don't"
6402320,6406480," really do super chat to twitch bits or anything like that the way to interact"
6406480,6410480," with the show is through merch messages other than just random"
6410480,6415520," comments that we do read from time to time and you send those by going to lttstore.com"
6415520,6419280," and picking up whatever kind of floats your boat whether it's uncle"
6419280,6423120," lioness's hoodie or water bottle or any of the new products that we've launched"
6423120,6425600," this week we'll go through those in a little bit"
6425600,6430880," um or just a gift card if you just want to send a message but nothing's really"
6430880,6434320," catching your eye this week uh dan do you want to pick out a few merch"
6434320,6437520," messages for us to go through and then maybe we'll"
6437520,6441360," oh my goodness we gotta get sponsors done man we've got a lot of stuff happening"
6441360,6446080," we still have a lot of topics to talk about this every time every week"
6446080,6450800," man no i want to talk about i want to talk about the survey that shows the"
6450800,6453920," vr adoption is slow among teens i think we"
6453920,6456880," i think we know for real i actually have a lot to say about that no yeah i think"
6456880,6459600," we've got to do sponsors first though i think hitting those now is a good idea"
6459600,6462960," okay sure let's do sponsors then three merch messages then sponsors i think"
6462960,6465760," that's a normal flow all right let's do it"
6465760,6470000," okay uh dan line us and luke love the show what's your take on amd"
6470000,6476720," all vey o m a 35d and its implementation of av1 and the use of ai in its ability"
6476720,6480080," to help with decision of bitrate of content is that in here i thought"
6480080,6483840," that was supposed to be a whole a whole topic is that in here is that even uh"
6483840,6487920," it's not a whole topic i didn't even see this this week i don't have any thoughts"
6487920,6492800," on this at all but that sounds super cool where it was in the chat"
6492800,6496000," oh it's gonna be crazy it's gonna be huge it's gonna be huge i'm pretty sure"
6496000,6499840," e-pods vox already has a video on it i'm like 99.9% sure of that"
6499840,6503040," whoa this is so cool this is basically like that"
6503040,6507120," specialized hardware that we wanted to get our hands on from google"
6507120,6515200," so we found this oh okay so i i heard years ago that google had built their"
6515200,6518880," own hardware to handle video encoding for youtube because"
6518880,6523040," doing it on cpu or gpu just didn't make sense at the kind of scale that they"
6523040,6526560," were encoding video and we reached out to them saying like hey"
6526560,6530640," we'd love to cover this but we can't just cover that"
6530640,6534480," it exists yeah like you got to show it to us you got to talk about the"
6534480,6540320," technology and they're like um no well this is this is basically it"
6540320,6545280," one watt per stream for av1 videoing code crazy"
6545280,6551520," okay yeah okay earlier line of xilinx cards okay so this is the xilinx acquisition"
6551520,6557920," whoa that is super cool is this something that i could just buy and put in an"
6557920,6562720," editing workstation and we could just encode like that or what like what am i"
6562720,6568240," looking at here is this more for like on the data center side i'm i'm just"
6568240,6572720," just seeing this now i was hoping there was going to be"
6572720,6580160," uh info in the doc for video and code blocks um and it uses machine learning"
6580160,6585040," to determine the optimal bit rate this is super cool i would love"
6585040,6588720," to do some kind of coverage of this in the future i'm not sure if this is going"
6588720,6593200," to be the kind of thing that would end up in a workstation ever or like anywhere"
6593200,6598400," near a consumer but so it's listed under data center"
6598400,6604480," okay on uh yeah on their website just so you know"
6604480,6611280," one watt per 1080p 60 channel being able to get it though like i mean"
6611280,6614320," there's some data center things that you can"
6614320,6621520," get you know 1600 dollar mrsp so what would what would a system for this"
6621520,6626320," look like like is this would this be"
6626320,6633280," how would flowplane use something like this for example"
6633280,6637440," this would be a little hard for us to get into our infrastructure right now"
6637440,6641760," um but would this help to solve like ingest"
6641760,6645600," bottlenecks okay okay here's an example right now the"
6645600,6648720," wanchow archive on flowplane takes a long time"
6648720,6654160," because it's just this colossal video and it's got to be encoded whereas"
6654160,6659040," google does magic encoding on the fly so that archives of four hour long"
6659040,6661920," streams can be available immediately and it's a bit of a pain point for folks"
6661920,6665840," on flowplane but something that has been brought up internally is the idea of"
6665840,6669840," having and i don't i didn't want to do this until we got a local"
6669840,6673680," full-time IT person yeah but now that we have one"
6673680,6678320," or are going to have one um i think it is a project that they might want to work"
6678320,6682960," on but we've wanted to have a node here yeah because if we"
6682960,6687760," could deal with all of the transcoding for that that has to happen from it"
6687760,6691520," because you guys have a lot of stuff which is great right thanks for using"
6691520,6694960," the platform i'm not complaining but a lot of it happens here a lot of the"
6694960,6698400," content on the platform is generated here right so if we can just transcode it"
6698400,6701680," here and then just upload it already transcoded"
6701680,6705280," sweet right so we could maybe use these for that"
6705280,6710480," now we have offered to give flowplane local hardware before okay"
6710480,6715920," but i will confess i will confess that every time we've done it"
6715920,6719840," we have without warning unceremoniously"
6719840,6723920," requisitioned it for something else sometimes when they were in the middle"
6723920,6728400," of using it literally so it's been a bit of a problem"
6728400,6731280," you can't so that's the thing if this happens"
6731280,6734960," it's not going into a building that like or a room or whatever that anyone just"
6734960,6738320," has willy-nilly access to no no i can't go in the server no"
6738320,6743280," i don't trust it no it'll be fine okay it'll be fine one"
6743280,6745600," lance is great to work with best boss i've ever had"
6745600,6749040," anytime he ever says this thing is yours and perpetuity"
6749040,6753760," do not trust that the work we need a video exactly"
6753760,6758160," it's not like the reason is going to be illegitimate"
6758160,6762480," but there's going to be a reason and it is going to be taken away okay the one"
6762480,6766400," it's very likely that it will be replaced with something just as cool or"
6766400,6770000," cooler i'm not saying this is just the worst thing ever"
6770000,6774640," but if it's like a piece of infrastructure and it has to stay there"
6774640,6778960," don't trust it that is a dangerous scenario okay that one that we ripped"
6778960,6783040," away while it was in use was six workstations one cpu"
6783040,6787520," um and it was not in the server room so there's no precedent for something"
6787520,6791680," being taken from you guys when it's actually installed in the rack"
6791680,6795200," it's fine if it's in the rack it's not nothing's going to happen just put a"
6795200,6798480," put a sticker on the front i have a lot of a float plane ink very"
6798480,6801840," not expensive history of lance being extremely problematic around"
6801840,6806480," infrastructure type things that goes back to before the company started"
6806480,6809680," mr flash drive yeah there was this one time i tossed a"
6809680,6815040," usb drive to luke across the room and thanks to his utter failure to catch it"
6815040,6820000," because he never played baseball i played other sports involved catching"
6820000,6823600," it was a bad throw um anyway the point is it"
6823600,6828400," hits like actually a miracle the reset pins on the motherboard or something"
6828400,6832320," what did it hit like well okay some of this is assumptions right"
6832320,6837040," but the result was that the ssd was unplugged the data cable to the ssd"
6837040,6841120," was unplugged so i think it must have hit the like metal clip and actually like"
6841120,6844320," yeah given enough force that it popped out it was"
6844320,6848880," i all i remember is that it was a one in a million shot it was crazy"
6848880,6852960," and it unplugged the forum while something critical was happening or"
6852960,6856000," something i don't fully remember that like corrupted it basically something"
6856000,6859920," that yeah the result was bad yeah it was very bad um"
6859920,6866160," adf aka l sdjf on float plane chat says line is trying to find a problem for"
6866160,6870000," the solution that's my whole career yeah that's like"
6870000,6874160," and again i'm not being critical or anything i'm not saying like yeah that's"
6874160,6877040," yeah yep i'm not saying the reasons aren't legit"
6877040,6880720," i'm not saying it doesn't make the most sense to do that thing"
6880720,6886880," but it's very often not wise to rely on infrastructure type things like"
6886880,6890960," mission critical type things to be running in line is general vison jaden"
6890960,6893360," still mad it was sitting in the middle of the"
6893360,6897760," float plane section of the office it was literally in our like office"
6897760,6902720," quarters yes it was not in like a shared area"
6902720,6909520," anyways there is theory to us doing stuff that does include this thing"
6909520,6913680," okay that'd be cool i just i mean we'd have to figure out like can we even buy"
6913680,6917200," these like what is the implementation of these like"
6917200,6920400," i don't know anything about that but even if we can't use these there's still"
6920400,6923680," theory to like having a node here we've wanted to do that for a very long time"
6923680,6928640," um and the more time goes on the more like"
6928640,6932080," volume of content you guys are making so it just"
6932080,6936160," tends to make like more and more sense because we we have a"
6936160,6943440," there's a bit of a scale problem in the sense of people's perceived levels of"
6943440,6946800," normalcy when it comes to how long things take"
6946800,6950800," because they'll be like oh yeah like google transcoates this video real fast"
6950800,6953920," it's like yeah they sure do i don't know if we're ever gonna get like"
6953920,6956640," that fast we have some solutions coming like"
6956640,6959840," right now we wait for all transcoding levels to be ready before we release a"
6959840,6963840," video um so something that's going to be changed at some point"
6963840,6968800," is we're going to allow videos to launch without 4k already ready"
6968800,6972640," similar to how youtube does so you can watch it at 1080p which our 1080p is"
6972640,6975840," really good um and if you want to watch in 4k like you"
6975840,6979760," might have to wait a little bit and it'll say when you go to like"
6979760,6982400," settings because you're like hey why isn't this in 4k and you want to set it"
6982400,6985440," to 4k it'll say like it's currently transcoating or whatever"
6985440,6988560," well i don't know if it'll say that but it'll have some indication that it's"
6988560,6993680," like still working on it um yeah"
6994160,7000160," hit us Dan all right next up um this one's from Jonathan"
7000160,7004080," do you still use all that janky stuff you have made over the years like the"
7004080,7009200," water-cooled network switch or the red camera thanks for the awesome vids"
7009200,7015360," the water-cooled camera we converted back to air-cooled because it was"
7015360,7020000," very stupid um the water-cooled network switch on the other hand"
7020000,7024080," in spite of also being very stupid is still very much in deployed"
7024080,7027440," in deployment right now uh it actually it runs in the camera den"
7027440,7031040," and i believe is the network switch that the ingest stations go through like"
7031040,7035440," it's it's part of our infrastructure 100 percent"
7035440,7039360," my water-cooled chair is still in action sort of"
7039360,7044320," it's had a bit of an accident Luke observed very acutely that the pump and"
7044320,7047760," res was on the floor when he came into my office either"
7047760,7054640," yesterday or today um i made a mistake we accidentally put the the reservoir"
7054640,7060800," and the pump and the um the the the heat sink for the pelchier"
7060800,7064240," we we put them somewhere where if you lean the chair back"
7064240,7067440," it would interfere with the base of the chair"
7067440,7071760," and i forgot about that and i was like oh i want to leave my chair back and i"
7071760,7074880," unlocked it because i've always had it locked to make sure i don't do that"
7074880,7080560," and i went crunch yeah so need to either reprint or"
7080560,7084080," ideally redesign yeah the mount for that you shouldn't be there you should be"
7084080,7087120," able to lean your chair back"
7087120,7093520," the options were shoot the video or oh no yeah not shoot the video today and i"
7093520,7095840," don't get it going we decided to shoot the video"
7095840,7098000," yeah"
7098000,7102480," but but it has been in use since then it's"
7102480,7107040," amazing i brought it to whale land did you try it yeah it was nice"
7107040,7110480," it was genuinely nice pretty cool i would i would if this was like a"
7110480,7113200," commercial solution it would be something that i would look into"
7113200,7115360," i mean you basically have that for your bed yeah"
7115360,7118080," like if you could just have that why wouldn't i do it elsewhere for a chair"
7118080,7120400," yeah why not yeah 100 yeah yep"
7120400,7128480," next one another one right here we go um"
7128480,7132800," let's archive that this is from john liness any fun anecdotes about the"
7132800,7136160," making of the uncle liness video oh yeah it was"
7136160,7140080," totally fun people couldn't stop playing with the baby goats and all the"
7140080,7145040," animals on the farms um the alpacas were hilarious"
7145040,7149600," uh lots of fun i'd oh oh that didn't make it into the behind the scenes"
7149600,7154560," but i have this i have this great video of riley in the alpaca"
7154560,7158560," penge being riley in an alpaca pen fawesome"
7158560,7164960," um yeah i love it um if you really i mean honestly"
7164960,7169280," most of what was really fun ended up in the behind the scenes video on float"
7169280,7172240," plane that's one of the one of the cooler float plane exclusives that we've"
7172240,7176160," done in a while so those of you who are on float plane can go check that out"
7176160,7182400," i'd say the coolest thing being behind the scenes on a shoot that i didn't"
7182400,7186080," organize i pretty much showed up as talent"
7186080,7190480," sort of i mean i uh helped with direction a little bit"
7190480,7197200," i obviously came up with the concept initially and then i sat and i helped"
7197200,7201360," edit the script so i was involved but i hadn't"
7201360,7204720," been like the live shoot i hadn't been to any of the locations i hadn't seen any"
7204720,7209280," of the props like when i saw my overalls and i was like yeah"
7209280,7213200," um and just some of the okay here's a fun one"
7213200,7217520," i didn't see a single comment have you watched the video"
7217520,7221360," uh yeah the i have watched some of the behind the scenes i have watched the"
7221360,7225520," whole main video okay do you want to know my gripe"
7225520,7229600," oh okay who do you who do you ask to be in the video"
7229600,7235600," i didn't ask anyone me oh did i yes i mean i wasn't in it bro"
7235600,7241840," i look i don't really care it was very that was a that was a tough i was gonna"
7241840,7246320," say i also had an extremely busy time around that area i probably wouldn't"
7246320,7249440," have been able to do it anyways i just wanted to yeah i i'm sorry i i would"
7249440,7253200," have loved to have you there but i just left it to riley to figure out and uh"
7253200,7255920," to jacob to figure out who who's going to be there it was"
7255920,7260800," hilarious the amount of i really enjoyed that they put a lot of effort to make"
7260800,7263440," sure that something was happening in the background"
7263440,7267120," just all the time i thought that was great you have to watch it twice yeah"
7267120,7271440," that was that was really good there was one that i insisted that we make a little"
7271440,7275760," bit more obvious and yet this is what i was going to say a second ago"
7275760,7280160," i didn't see a single comment acknowledging the name tag"
7280160,7286480," in the meat bag did you notice yeah do you get the reference"
7286480,7293920," that i don't know what it was are you bringing it up"
7293920,7299760," um i i i i it was it i'm not a hundred percent sure that i remember"
7299760,7302720," there being a name tag i remember identifying like that"
7302720,7305920," it has been communicated that this is human"
7305920,7310960," you know no so the name tag in the in the meat bag is"
7310960,7316320," pearl okay that's uh"
7316480,7319920," logan paul's abandoned yeah yeah i was gonna say it's a pig but i was trying"
7319920,7323280," to remember why i knew that so the idea was just that like you"
7323280,7327920," still there's all kinds of things in the meat"
7327920,7333040," so i i insisted that we get a close out okay so i definitely didn't get that"
7333040,7337440," right now okay i didn't see i didn't see anyone catch it and i was like oh i"
7337440,7340640," thought that was really funny that's pretty sort of that's pretty good"
7340640,7343920," it's a little bit old of a reference as far as internet goes"
7343920,7350800," it is yeah it is funny it is funny but i i still i i still i was"
7350800,7355520," i was into it um i want to say that the coolest thing being behind the scenes"
7355520,7360160," though just to appreciate as we as we made our way from one"
7360160,7364560," location to the next was how amazing the locations were"
7364560,7370960," that drug den we didn't change much"
7373360,7379520," we brought in the little green bottles but like there were like weird skulls and"
7379520,7386880," like weird retro containers and there was there was a couch"
7386880,7391680," that a lot of weeds been smoked on i'll tell you that much you know like it was"
7391680,7397120," how did they scout that place we got really lucky okay we didn't start"
7397120,7401680," location scouting in earnest until probably about 10 days before the shoot"
7401680,7405920," we got extraordinary extraordinarily lucky"
7405920,7412880," shout out rondrizo i want to say farms and then whatever uh whatever the other"
7412880,7419760," farm was that we that we shot at uh oh man now i now i feel really bad uh"

7871520,7874400," so um so i had a question in here about that"
7874400,7878880," the craziest thing in my opinion i think this happened this week"
7878880,7883040," um there's i mean there's been updates to the repo as of five hours ago so it's"
7883040,7886480," very live just like everything in the spaces"
7886480,7889680," but microsoft announced uh something called"
7889680,7895280," Jarvis and this is just one of the actually many"
7895280,7899680," options of this type of thing that i've seen"
7899680,7902880," announced or talked about recently and this is where things are getting really"
7902880,7906560," crazy i talked i think a couple weeks ago i think this is going to be an"
7906560,7909760," absolutely massive jump when these things hit more uh"
7909760,7915520," wide adoption because plugins with chat gpt okay i'm gonna i'm gonna rewind"
7915520,7918240," slightly make sure everybody's with me before i keep going"
7918240,7923520," so chat gpt extremely powerful limited in ability"
7923520,7927600," right it can write creative things really really well it can't"
7927600,7932400," do things for you so much in the coding space it can do things for you to a"
7932400,7934560," certain degree there's some limitations there it will"
7934560,7938080," literally spit out code that has errors stuff like that"
7938080,7941840," but you can work with it to fix those errors or you can just work uh use it as"
7941840,7945040," a very good like starting off point for small projects stuff like that"
7945040,7948320," it has ability to do things in the coding space"
7948320,7951840," but it can't really do things in other spaces and it has issues with math and"
7951840,7956800," all this other type of stuff well a lot of those problems were fixed"
7956800,7960560," very quickly but in a private sense because not that many people including"
7960560,7964320," myself i'm very sad about this not that many people have access"
7964320,7967680," to plugins plugins was announced i think a couple weeks ago"
7967680,7972240," um and the first plugin that immediately i was like oh my god if they make this"
7972240,7976240," this is going to be absolutely insane and it was literally like the first one"
7976240,7982240," they did um was wolfram alpha wolfram alpha is super cool has been super"
7982240,7987280," cool for a long time and is very not new um i think people that aren't in the"
7987280,7992800," space haven't necessarily heard of it um but wolfram alpha is an answer engine"
7992800,7996880," developed by wolfram research it answers factual queries based"
7996880,8000880," by computing uh sorry it answers factual queries by computing answers from"
8000880,8007680," externally sourced data wolfram alpha was released on May 18th 2009"
8008240,8012080," yeah and the the the type of things that it does is like"
8012080,8016480," quite advanced math and calculus so you take"
8016480,8021600," chat gpt which can't really do these things"
8021600,8027040," and you give it a plugin where chat gpt can ask wolfram alpha for the answer"
8027040,8031680," and suddenly wow it's extremely powerful right"
8031680,8037760," now the next stage of this is not just plugins but Jarvis and i think they call"
8037760,8042640," it hugging face which is like that's a concerning name uh but Jarvis and"
8042640,8044480," hugging face and all this other type of stuff"
8044480,8050080," that allows you to link all these systems together so you could ask chat gpt"
8050080,8055840," you'd be like hey i need to do this thing and chat gpt or any other llm"
8055840,8060080," can reach out find the different services that it thinks it could use to"
8060080,8063600," accomplish that task assign various tasks to the"
8063600,8067520," different services get those services to actually execute those tasks"
8067520,8071840," get responses from those services potentially iterate multiple times if it"
8071840,8078400," needs to and then spit out the result to you so it can do more things now it"
8078400,8081760," can actually get things done that's a big"
8081760,8086240," big step um there's also a bunch of other things that"
8086240,8088720," happened uh someone's suing i think it's open"
8088720,8093520," ai for defamation because um yeah like made up something about them"
8093520,8096960," it called them a criminal or something like that they're actually a whistleblower"
8096960,8100640," yeah pretty cool that's going to be a huge issue"
8100640,8103760," i mean it's wrong all the time oh yeah so if you start asking it about people"
8103760,8107040," it's going to also be wrong people yep and that's going to cause some"
8107040,8110720," problems um yeah there's there's there's lots of"
8110720,8114720," stuff going on in my opinion if you just kind of like dabbling in this stuff and"
8114720,8118000," only looking into it a little bit i would look into like"
8118000,8122400," Microsoft's Jarvis um hugging face stuff like that in my opinion that's where"
8122400,8125360," the most interesting stuff is happening um"
8125360,8129280," this second and i think that's where i'll kind of leave it"
8129280,8133120," isn't hugging face more like an online repo of all these"
8133120,8140080," aitunes yeah but you use Jarvis to get an LLM to tap into hugging face to find"
8140080,8142960," the correct one oh good god no yeah no no no no no"
8142960,8145440," yeah no no no no that's maybe that is conversation"
8145440,8150480," that's over all all right continue line of place"
8150480,8158320," survey says VR adoption slow among teens who would have thought it our original"
8158320,8162880," source here is digital information world"
8162880,8167040," only four percent of american teens say they use"
8167040,8172080," VR good heavens i thought it was worse only four"
8172080,8177120," percent of the teen okay around 29 said they own a VR headset"
8177120,8181040," in spite of this only four percent of the teenagers that own these headsets"
8181040,8183760," use them daily so that's that's not four percent of"
8183760,8186560," overall people that's four percent of people that own the headsets with"
8186560,8191040," 14 percent saying they use them on a weekly basis what this means is less"
8191040,8195600," than one percent of american teenagers who responded to this survey"
8195600,8200080," use VR headsets every day can i just jump in and say"
8200080,8203280," that's a lot better than i thought it would be honestly it's higher than i"
8203280,8207840," expected that's 29 percent where are you"
8207840,8215600," polling these teenagers that 29 percent of them own a VR headset"
8215600,8219040," this is like literally just it was a very"
8219040,8224000," apparently a sample size of 5600 american teens yeah but"
8224000,8229040," the size doesn't matter as much if it's all from like here first one"
8229040,8235040," if it's i agree no i don't consider this to be a controversial take sir"
8235040,8242080," i think that size is not the most important it's how you use the number of"
8242080,8245040," people in the survey where you got them from how you"
8245040,8249440," you know uh yeah yeah so like if if they pulled all of these"
8249440,8253200," 5600 people from like extremely affluent neighborhoods"
8253200,8258240," yeah that's going to skew the results uh i could see that skewing the results"
8258240,8261200," two ways i could see that skewing the ownership percentage"
8261200,8266160," obviously but i could also see that skewing the daily and weekly use"
8266160,8268640," yeah because if you have a whole bunch of other"
8268640,8272800," like toys to play with yeah maybe you don't play with your VR headset that much"
8272800,8275760," and if you if all you have is a VR headset maybe you use it more"
8275760,8278720," probably use it a lot you probably use it to watch movies you probably use it to"
8278720,8282960," play games when i could afford less games i played"
8282960,8286480," fewer total of games more total of time yep"
8286480,8291440," i mean there's no way that today i would log the kind of hours in pilot wings"
8291440,8295600," yeah that i did when i was nine yeah there's just no way when you're going"
8295600,8298240," like ah i want to play video game and you have two"
8298240,8302560," yeah like i i owned four cartridges super Mario world"
8302560,8307040," super Mario all-stars pilot wings and uh final fantasy six that's a good set"
8307040,8310240," up i mean yeah it's good set up it's not like they were bad games"
8310240,8313680," yeah what's really funny is i used to i used to like rent games"
8313680,8317920," yeah and never enjoy them because i guess i already owned"
8317920,8322240," all the best game came to your games on the platform completely by accident"
8322240,8325200," i just thought the box art for final fantasy was super cool and like"
8325200,8329680," whoa that's uh yeah like it's pure pure chance"
8329680,8332320," yeah yeah sampling bias on what's like yeah there you go"
8332320,8337440," yeah it's like it's a decent number but i don't know i don't i don't i don't"
8337440,8341440," if you could somehow it's not reasonable but if you could somehow pull all"
8341440,8346000," teenagers in america i seriously doubt that number stays around 29 oh"
8346000,8350480," not even close no shot not even close uh the rest of our notes say teenagers"
8350480,8354640," are typically seen as a bell weather of the direction of future technology"
8354640,8358000," i mean yes and no have we talked a bit about how like"
8358000,8361280," gen z is apparently hitting the workplace and yeah i think we did talk about that"
8361280,8364640," recently just like has no idea how to you know set up a printer and stuff and"
8364640,8367600," it's like yeah yeah okay there's definitely things we need that"
8367600,8371920," teenagers don't think is cool and stuff that's like not going away"
8371920,8376880," that might be more true uh for like technology trends in"
8376880,8380400," insurance consumer technology not okay works works that's fair"
8380400,8384720," the studies creators state that the lukewarm usage demonstrates that vr"
8384720,8388480," remains early days and that these devices are less important than smartphones i"
8388480,8392320," mean oh yeah did we need a survey of 5600 people to tell us that these"
8392320,8396400," devices are less important than smartphones maybe not but"
8396400,8400000," i mean hey yeah it doesn't hurt to back up your"
8400000,8406240," your feeling with data so that's good yep um yep"
8406240,8409680," for context 84 percent of american teens have their own phone"
8409680,8414080," that number i do actually believe and 81 percent of a game console"
8414080,8417200," that's pretty surprising really so i was pretty unusual then i didn't have a"
8417200,8421600," game console until i oh this is really interesting"
8421600,8425440," i did not own a game console in my teens i had a super"
8425440,8431200," nintendo when i was a pre-teen i moved to my parents or to my mom's"
8431200,8435920," i did not own a game console until i bought a Wii"
8435920,8440000," i had already graduated high school i was 20 my brother and i wow i never"
8440000,8443760," thought about that my brother and i have have fond memories"
8443760,8449120," of working together to collaboratively this was like"
8449120,8452400," i don't know if this was this must have been orchestrated by my parents"
8452400,8456320," somehow to get us to like learn like teamwork and like co-funding things and"
8456320,8462720," stuff because my brother and i busted but like actually really hard"
8462720,8466320," to be able to afford i think it was more than one console"
8466320,8470640," we both have extremely vivid memories of like once we had finally pooled our"
8470640,8474720," money together enough to be able to buy donkey kong 64"
8474720,8479600," that like is in the yellow cartridge but also came with the n64 booster pack"
8479600,8483680," thing which was just like more ram or something i don't know what it was"
8483680,8487520," that took us a while to save for it was actually like quite some time"
8487520,8490320," but we got it and it was awesome i literally remember"
8490320,8493680," the walmart that we went to to buy it i remember what door we were entering"
8493680,8496480," from i remember what side of that door we entered from this is like an"
8496480,8501120," important memory in my brain and we recently discovered that he also"
8501120,8504880," remembers exactly those details this was like"
8504880,8509840," we had some consoles bonding we earned those damn consoles"
8509840,8514080," that's awesome it was cool i don't know i'm down with it"
8514080,8518880," um except for the the original xbox with halo"
8518880,8522000," that was a christmas present yeah i remember you telling me the story"
8522000,8526560," and like hard-troll this on it was like all set up under this thing that was"
8526560,8530240," like unrelated and it was like he convinced us that it was a gift for"
8530240,8534320," mom and that we were supposed to stop everyone else"
8534320,8538000," from getting it to be one of the presents that was opened early"
8538000,8542720," we have very long christmases it came from a long time i'm not going to explain"
8542720,8545360," why but like we spend a lot of time with each present that gets"
8545360,8548080," opened you open your present you examine it for a little bit you pass around"
8548080,8550480," people check it out you play with it for a second whatever and then we go into"
8550480,8554080," the next one so it was like hours of my brother and i"
8554080,8556640," fighting everyone else in the family off from"
8556640,8560480," getting us to open this thing because we thought it was a crystal ball"
8560480,8565520," why that would be a thing for my mom so neither of us question like why the"
8565520,8568880," heck did you buy mom a crystal ball but we're both like okay"
8568880,8573920," there's no way anyone's gonna like open this my dad told no one else"
8573920,8576880," so everyone's confused because they know what it is"
8576880,8580640," so they're like trying to get us to open this present for ourselves and we're"
8580640,8583120," like he's just sitting there laughing his butt off"
8583120,8587360," yeah at this dynamic that he's created"
8587360,8590320," so funny that was that was a that was a"
8590320,8593200," kingly present that's awesome played a lot of halo"
8593200,8598000," um what's not a kingly present is general motors"
8598000,8603600," deciding to instead of just keep doing what's working really really well"
8603600,8608800," which is apple car play and android auto they are going to remove access to"
8608800,8613520," both of them in 2024 or in their 2024 vehicle lineup"
8613520,8617360," in favor i honestly i thought this might had to be April fools like you guys"
8617360,8619520," can't possibly be stupid enough for this"
8619520,8624560," um so rather than using phone projection systems that just"
8624560,8631040," now wirelessly just use your phone they are instead going to provide"
8631040,8637360," seamless access to a new native google powered infotainment system"
8638240,8645040," terrible i've been highly critical of tesla's use of their own proprietary"
8645040,8650160," system with no ability to run android auto um from my understanding there is"
8650160,8656560," no reason that they couldn't as a app or icon or window or whatever you"
8656560,8660320," want to call it within their system they just"
8660320,8663200," want to google they're like pay them for it well what they really want is they"
8663200,8666400," want to collect all the telemetry data themselves"
8666400,8670480," um so rather than it living on your phone they want it to live"
8670480,8673760," on the infotainment system and there's probably some"
8673760,8676800," terms of service advantage to doing it this way would be"
8676800,8680800," my best guess there could be some performance advantage as well in terms"
8680800,8685520," of interface or whatever else and inter compatibility between especially"
8685520,8688480," older phones running older potentially"
8688480,8693040," unsecured versions of android could could be a problem there are"
8693040,8697760," some problems that this will solve but there are new problems that this will"
8697760,8701280," create like when they decide to stop updating it"
8701280,8710240," you are by a new car that's stupid yeah that's really dumb"
8710240,8714080," yeah i uh my car had this happen they stopped updating maps yeah and so now"
8714080,8717040," you just have an old map or no map yeah great"
8717040,8721920," perfect whereas my vault i never had to worry about any software"
8721920,8726480," anything because every time i got a new phone or a new operating system upgrade"
8726480,8730320," or whatever else i got new android auto and everything was fine and i never"
8730320,8733200," had to care about anything other than the occasional"
8733200,8737520," you know bluetooth pairing hack or hack excuse me uh hitch"
8737520,8742480," which actually still bewilders me both the vault and the tycan"
8742480,8746080," and i i guess i guess all these systems work like this"
8746080,8750640," even when you plug them in they still handle all the audio transfer over"
8750640,8753200," bluetooth"
8753200,8757920," why there's a huge gap in what happens on my phone"
8757920,8760640," and the sound coming out of the bluetooth in my car"
8760640,8763840," i don't mind it because i'm basically just listening to music all the time"
8763840,8767760," but like if if i go to next song it's like"
8767760,8772080," actually one or two seconds my phone will have gone to next song"
8772080,8776000," immediately but my what the sound coming through the bluetooth just like"
8776000,8780800," doesn't catch up for an extremely long period of time it's very weird"
8780800,8785680," i'm really i'm really frustrated by this because gm has done some really dumb"
8785680,8790000," stuff they've also done some pretty okay stuff i"
8790000,8794800," loved the vault i still love the vault i still think it's just an outstanding"
8794800,8798000," card so ahead of its time and i think that's its biggest problem"
8798000,8800160," um"
8800160,8803040," oh it's a speck within the bluetooth protocol well it's annoying"
8803040,8810800," yeah well it sucks yeah don't like it it sucks and i hate it"
8810800,8816960," we should talk about all the stuff that people have found because they're really"
8816960,8820800," smart but that we haven't actually talked about for ltt store this week"
8820800,8826480," oh yes yeah the the show has gotten really full"
8826480,8831040," i don't really know how to deal with that there's a couple of there's a couple of"
8831040,8834800," big ltt store things um okay here we go"
8834800,8837760," wait no that's not it crap where is this"
8837760,8842080," uh what i can't find it"
8842080,8846720," okay here we go here we go here we go we launched a couple new products this week"
8846720,8852080," one of these i am so excited about um is it set up for luke to model or is it"
8852080,8854880," set up for me to model today what size are these things"
8854880,8857760," apparently it's me it's you i'm pretty sure um"
8857760,8865120," this thing has been a long time coming it was actually started well before the"
8865120,8871680," 3d down jacket but just was stuck in in pre-production"
8871680,8876880," and then production hell for like over a year because it was just"
8876880,8881600," impossible to get the materials right the waterproofing right"
8881600,8888480," the seams right so this kind of this kind of construction uses like a"
8888480,8893120," it uses stitching in some places but it also uses like this um"
8893120,8897200," this adhesive and taping in other spots in order to make sure that it says"
8897200,8902800," waterproof is possible finding a factory finding the materials"
8902800,8907440," that make it so that it's going to stay"
8908400,8911440," and we'll stay so that it's going to stay together"
8911440,8914720," and also not just like show through to the front"
8914720,8919920," was extraordinarily difficult um this is this is competitive with wind"
8919920,8926000," breakers that cost far far more uh it's extremely water resistant i know i"
8926000,8930480," never use the word waterproof but if you look at the um if you look at the"
8930480,8933360," construction it's rated for yeah here we go"
8933360,8938720," uh 10 000 millimeters of water fall or like you know"
8938720,8941280," whatever whatever that means i think that's like a pressure rating or"
8941280,8944000," something i don't know we use this third party company"
8944000,8951520," for for all of our like materials and um like design testing"
8951520,8957920," because that's what they specialize in uses a ykk aquac aqua seal zipper on all"
8957920,8962800," three exterior pockets it's i think really cool looking"
8962800,8966320," i saw jake bellavants wearing it or bellavants excuse me"
8966320,8968480," uh in the office i was like where did you get that"
8968480,8971280," are we launching that thing now because you look"
8971280,8977280," freaking awesome um one quick thing dan were you wearing"
8977280,8983040," uh a medium in your photos uh yes i believe so you wore the large"
8983040,8986800," and i wore the one i think lynus is wearing now so if people are trying to"
8986800,8991440," check dan or myself for photos on the store our"
8991440,8994400," information is wrong i'm wearing a large not an extra large"
8994400,8997520," oh did that get missed and dan is wearing a medium not a large"
8997520,9000880," yeah that's right so if you are our size"
9000880,9006000," how sizes when okay because uh yeah they didn't quite"
9006000,9009440," fit us that perfectly just just in case because i know"
9009440,9013120," it's very likely people are shopping for stuff like now so check check the size"
9013120,9016720," guide um and make sure that you're you're good to go"
9016720,9021440," oh bit of a thing there also you don't list the arm length"
9021440,9025920," um so i'm six foot two or something like that and i have weird gangly long"
9025920,9028800," arms um and for me the medium fit better in the"
9028800,9032560," shoulders and the arms as well you can just"
9032560,9036560," scroll the big pictures now by the way anywho it has this little adjustment in"
9036560,9038800," the hood that makes it so that you can make it"
9038800,9042320," sit back a little bit further if that's what you prefer or if you want to"
9042320,9046160," really stay out of the rain then you can set it to the full distance and you can"
9046160,9051360," like make sure that the rain drips not on your face um"
9051360,9056320," yeah i am missing a lot of details on this one"
9056320,9063440," because it was hell to get it to market and have it be as good as it is"
9063440,9067600," but i basically never need another windbreaker slash tell me to read out the"
9067600,9071440," like product information water water layer again now really"
9071440,9076800," exciting really excited oh yeah we added um uh venting in the armpits that's"
9076800,9081920," always nice uh oh did we end up with the reflective"
9081920,9085760," yes there are reflective elements on the front and the back i forget what they"
9085760,9090320," are oh yeah here on the shoulders and then where's the one on the back"
9090320,9097280," oh yeah there there is yeah yeah yeah those are reflective for safety"
9097280,9099040," let's see if there's anything else that i missed"
9099040,9102880," yeah but venting on the oh yeah there's venting on the back as well"
9102880,9108880," so this getting this um to stay down and not just be like flappy and weird"
9108880,9113200," but also oh here here that's not even immediately a pair yeah i didn't"
9113200,9117280," notice that personally yeah just everything"
9117280,9122000," it kind of helps that you have black under the white because then if it"
9122000,9125920," gaps off the shadow doesn't look different so that's why i couldn't tell"
9125920,9130640," it was like actually separated i think we would do a way better job of"
9130640,9133440," communicating what's special about our products if we took"
9133440,9137760," every prototype and kind of talked through them"
9137760,9141360," kind of like what a sous show dust when they launched the ally or when they"
9141360,9144800," previewed the ally where they were like yeah so here's everything that we look"
9144800,9148000," at this is where we started here's why we didn't do it and this is where we"
9148000,9151040," ended up because it pretty cool definitely gives a better"
9151040,9154560," appreciation for the for the finished product"
9154560,9160640," um very very ykk zippers because that's just how we do"
9160640,9165840," yep fit similar to the yeah the fit is pretty similar to the 3d"
9165840,9170400," down jacket maybe a little bit looser in the body because this is just a"
9170400,9175040," windbreaker slash rain layer and the expectation is that you're wearing"
9175040,9178000," something under it whereas with the 3d down jacket you can wear something"
9178000,9183200," under it but it's not necessarily a given yeah like for me i originally"
9183200,9188000," had the excel but if i wasn't wearing a sweater"
9188000,9191920," it's a really big jacket on me yeah and if i'm not wearing a sweater"
9191920,9195600," the large fits me better the other big launch this week"
9195600,9200080," is a design that was done probably like six months eight months ago"
9200080,9203680," but we haven't been able to launch because of printing constraints"
9203680,9208800," so it matches our our hard drive kind of neon design"
9208800,9212960," but it's a motherboard this time i think loi did a bang up job of the design and"
9212960,9216880," our t-shirt printer also did a bang up job of nailing the color on this one"
9216880,9221680," it looks very striking um and it looks especially good just kind of peeking"
9221680,9225520," up under a under a mostly zipped hoodie absolutely love that one that's"
9225520,9230240," available now as well um dad hats are now a bonus bin item"
9230240,9235280," so if you order any of these things whether it's the um the windbreaker or"
9235280,9241040," the new shirt oh what would be the whole hat as opposed to part of a hat"
9241040,9244080," you guys are just determined to give away as much"
9244080,9248560," as much as you can yeah the funny the fuss tray is like"
9248560,9251040," sir the"
9251040,9257280," yes go on there's just so much value in there i don't know the bonus bin the"
9257280,9260880," bonus bin um yeah well the i i'm going to be"
9260880,9266480," completely blunt with you dad hats have not been selling particularly well"
9266480,9270000," um and these are these are a big"
9270000,9274800," these are a big hit for us because compared to the first hats that we"
9274800,9279920," launched just the the basic hats the cost on these is about triple"
9279920,9286400," they're really expensive um it's a combination of the materials"
9286400,9291520," the washing process that they undergo yeah and the stitching"
9291520,9296000," they're like super super expensive compared to just a basic hat"
9296000,9298800," but they just haven't been moving that well i don't know if we've"
9298800,9302080," really promoted them well to be honest with you"
9302080,9305600," i think it's just a style of hat"
9305600,9311280," straight up i had very little to do with this particular one i didn't really"
9311280,9316640," it's not a category of product that was well understood by me or um i i"
9316640,9319440," liked the designs i thought they were super cool i think Sarah did a great"
9319440,9324000," job of that um but i just i was like i'm dad hats i mean yeah like i"
9324000,9327040," guess so yeah we can try that uh they haven't been a huge"
9327040,9330080," success for us over the last year or whatever"
9330080,9334720," and so we're we're going for it there are bonus bin item let's go you want"
9334720,9339440," pins you want stickers you want dad hats throw it in your order"
9339440,9343520," crazy and send a merge message i think that's it i think that's it for"
9343520,9347440," nope there's that's that's a lie we need to get some feedback from you guys"
9347440,9352240," again dan do you want to man the loot cam on it"
9352400,9358800," so we've seen quite a few requests for a laptop bag"
9358800,9365200," we are working on a laptop bag that's actually that's actually pretty sharp"
9365200,9370640," yep there's a logo here it might end up being a little bit smaller"
9370640,9374800," just because i think that's exactly the same size okay you have this bad habit"
9374800,9377680," can you lift this i want to see it myself over the lower third i want to see it"
9377680,9382720," myself for the love of god luke lift it over the lower third"
9382720,9385600," see the actual sleeve for the laptop yeah which is this one"
9385600,9391760," and then there's there's additional slots for various things you know"
9391760,9398640," okay one second yk k zippers of course uh they're the water water resistant ones"
9398640,9402640," from the backpack now we're really we're really proud"
9402640,9407360," of one particular innovation here in our laptop sleeve and that is the"
9407360,9411440," the big orange stretchy pouch that's on the left there you want to just kind of"
9411440,9415280," stick your hand in there it's like quite quite stretchy you know"
9415280,9420640," yeah yeah because this has always been sort of baffling to me"
9420640,9423920," why do laptops leaves not have somewhere to put your"
9423920,9429680," cotting charger how is that a thing oh yeah yeah and with this you might not"
9429680,9434160," even have to unplug it why is that a thing it's so frustrating"
9434160,9438560," also oh shoot i don't have my backpack on me but the other stretchy pocket which"
9438560,9441280," is over on the right guess what that's for"
9441280,9445360," mouse oh yeah yeah oh yeah um that's i like that this one is"
9445360,9449120," mesh and see through so if you need to put like usb drive or some other little"
9449120,9452720," things uh then on the other side uh that's designed for you to kind of"
9452720,9455840," coil up your cables and then stick them through the"
9455840,9459760," the elastics it's wider ones on the left skinnier ones on the right"
9459760,9464480," and then the mesh down there is oh yeah more for like uh yeah SD cards or"
9464480,9467920," again that you can see through yeah you can find your stuff yeah looking at it"
9467920,9471600," now i think it might be let us know there's a forum thread that i'm going to"
9471600,9475360," link in the comments here for you guys there's a forum thread where we'd like"
9475360,9479520," to get your feedback but i'm kind of feeling maybe another zipper pocket on"
9479520,9484160," one of those and maybe uh the separated pockets like it has"
9484160,9489200," now on the other one uh the strap is very noteworthy it"
9489200,9494880," uses the same padding as our backpack and we have changed the geometry"
9494880,9498640," slightly because of the way that it sits on your shoulder slightly differently"
9498640,9503600," this is the best laptop bag strap that i have ever used it's actually"
9503600,9508400," comfortable which is another why is this innovative sort of"
9508400,9513840," um question it's super rugged and durable it uses all"
9513840,9518080," uh metal fasteners where it attaches to the bag it can tuck away in there or you"
9518080,9521360," can put some documents or whatever else in there that's a that's does that one"
9521360,9524560," zip uh i don't think so no that one doesn't zip i think the"
9524560,9528720," other side does yeah yeah the other side has a zip"
9528720,9532240," there we go a little something like that always orange there's some uh"
9532240,9535200," some pockets there's one little pockets in case you want to stuff something"
9535200,9540320," in there yeah we're planning two sizes that's the"
9540320,9544480," 1314 and then we're planning a 1516 there is a"
9544480,9548720," handle but the handle is whoops the handle is like a like"
9548720,9554160," secondary you use it once in a while we wanted the handle it we wanted to be"
9554160,9558400," less about holding the thing by the handle and more about it being a sling"
9558400,9561520," i like that that subtle because i would definitely use it but it's mostly"
9561520,9563840," gonna be thrown over my shoulder for sure and in"
9563840,9568000," our traditional style there's two rivets holding the handle in place so it will"
9568000,9572000," never come out and then that is the laptop sleeve i think you were a little"
9572000,9576320," confused yeah i was yeah so is this like more of like a"
9576320,9580160," uh anything else like tablet sleeve whatever whatever else"
9580160,9583920," yeah just anything else this is this is like softer material yeah"
9583920,9586960," so that's like our like a soft touch like almost like um"
9586960,9590640," feels like a suede or something like that so nice on your laptop yeah not that not"
9590640,9593520," that this side's gonna scratch it or anything but it's just"
9593520,9597680," nice and smooth on this side yeah i'm really excited about this one it's"
9597680,9603120," gonna be absolutely killer it looks sharp"
9603120,9606720," so there's also these so you can just like carabiner things onto the side of it"
9606720,9610240," i don't know how easy that is to see but yeah we we weren't really sure what"
9610240,9614240," people would use those for truthfully the main inspiration for me thanks Dan"
9614240,9618880," was just like little like jewels and figurines and stuff like if people just"
9618880,9624240," want to hang stuff off their bag we also we've also seen people talk about"
9624240,9628560," you know hanging there they're like AirPods case even though i'm not sure"
9628560,9634640," that that's the greatest idea but hey it's some people have like it's there"
9634640,9640640," i've seen these like gel silicon wrap things that hold AirPods cases sure"
9640640,9644720," so i think that might make it more okay yeah something like that sure"
9644720,9647760," but yeah we it's basically so you can you can"
9647760,9652240," strap anything to it that you want in terms of price i can tell you right now"
9652240,9655600," that the more zippers and the more pockets and the more"
9655600,9660160," detailed construction you add to something like a bag"
9660160,9664880," the more it costs but our goal is has never been to set out to make like a"
9664880,9668000," mediocre bag i think there's a lot of mediocre bags on the market if you want"
9668000,9671680," one of those you can just go buy one you don't have to wait"
9671680,9678080," but i think this thing looks absolutely killer do you know the really excited"
9678080,9680560," do you know the price point on it no i don't okay yeah"
9680560,9683280," i mean it's still in development so every time we remove a zipper we can"
9683280,9688000," change something or add a pocket or make it a little wider a little narrower"
9688000,9692000," whatever bomb changes yeah very impressive seeing it fully loaded"
9692000,9695680," Matthew has been on point developing this and he"
9695680,9700240," like packed it full of stuff and i was like okay it's pretty heavy but i'm like"
9700240,9705440," oh but it's not bad it's not bad and then like we start like pulling all the"
9705440,9708400," stuff out of it really impressive i'm really excited"
9708400,9711680," it's made of the same materials as the backpacks so it uses water resistant"
9711680,9715760," zippers from ykk and the reprieve material is not"
9715760,9721280," waterproof by any measure but unless you are out in a torrential"
9721280,9724720," downpour for an extended period of time it's also not going to leak at the seams"
9724720,9730080," of the zippers and so it is probably fine but people have asked me like hey is it"
9730080,9735040," okay for riding my by cycling in the rain the answer is no"
9735040,9738560," no it's it's not intended for that"
9738560,9742560," yeah oh oh s dirk asks any chance of stalking replacement shoulder straps is"
9742560,9745680," a separate skew yes i had actually meant to bring that up"
9745680,9748240," when i was saying the shoulder strap is crazy comfortable"
9748240,9753280," because we like it so much that we are finding out what costing is for that"
9753280,9757920," individually it's not going to be cheap i think it's going to be like 20 bucks"
9757920,9763200," but it's like really good um and so again like if you want to cheap"
9763200,9766480," shoulder strap there's lots of options but we're we're really excited about"
9766480,9769280," ours tool oh uh twitch says link please you"
9769280,9772000," forgot i didn't forget it was earlier but hey there it is again"
9772000,9775360," so guys give your feedback let us know anything you'd like to see"
9775360,9779040," differently um i know i could already predict that there's going to be a ton of"
9779040,9782400," you asking for a 17 inch version i'm not sure if that's going to be in the"
9782400,9787600," cards i i don't know a messenger bag for a 17 inch"
9787600,9792000," big it makes it very heavy it's also really floppy big messenger bag"
9792000,9796960," yeah i don't know if i would go that far i don't know if we want to make a product"
9796960,9800480," that's going to be such allows the experience backpack for that to be"
9800480,9803200," completely well the backpack's not technically 17"
9803200,9807120," inch compatible even though it does fit a lot of big i was going to say yeah 17"
9807120,9812080," inch laptops yeah it'll fit the framework 16 for sure"
9812080,9816000," yeah the the 15 16 will be designed for laptops in that size"
9816000,9818480," random thing just before i forget someone grabbed"
9818480,9822480," smashclub.org and they're happy to transfer if you want it"
9822480,9827760," okay i was like i said i was mostly memeing on the whole smash club"
9827760,9831200," thing but uh do up do appreciate i just don't want to like"
9831200,9835200," forget that and then if you did actually want to call it that blah blah"
9835200,9838160," yeah all right now that we have shouted out all of the"
9838160,9841280," awesome new stuff from this week i think it seems like a good time to maybe do"

9844720,9849440," then merch message you want to do when show after after hour after dark yeah"

9862400,9866080," heard are totally a thing i think they literally are"
9866080,9870560," um yeah anyways here we go hey slick"
9870560,9874160," why did line us stop calling you slick why did he ever start"
9874160,9876960," have we talked about this before i don't because it was stupid and because he's"
9876960,9881040," stupid i think is what he's about to say"
9881040,9885520," oh i thought you were saying that about luke no no no no no um"
9885520,9890800," i mean he put different context um what was i gonna say yeah originally"
9890800,9894720," i wasn't supposed to be on camera at all um and originally all the people that"
9894720,9897760," weren't going to be on camera we're going to have like"
9897760,9902480," cool like screen names this was it was a different time okay"
9902480,9906480," that actually seemed like normal and appropriate in like 2010 or whatever"
9906480,9912400," it was and it had a precedent yes the cameraman uh from ncix tech tips"
9912400,9920240," wanted anonymity so the nickname was born out of my desire to interact with him"
9920240,9926720," behind the camera and wanting to respect his yeah his desire for privacy which in"
9926720,9930800," retrospect was probably a good idea for him"
9930800,9936160," and so all of a sudden i was like okay people grew so attached to the cameraman"
9936160,9939920," character you know trolling me about being a mac guy or whatever else"
9939920,9943760," um that i looked at and went oh wow this is a really good shtick"
9943760,9948640," how do we take this um nicknames and characters for the the people behind the"
9948640,9950720," scenes that interact with line us and how do we"
9950720,9955200," extend that and kind of grow the the cast of of of these colorful"
9955200,9958080," personalities but that are also shrouded in mystery"
9958080,9963520," that was the thinking and then slick came from oil slick because my computer at"
9963520,9968160," the time was submerged in oil uh and then edsel was diesel wasn't that just"
9968160,9971680," because like you couldn't pronounce his name no i literally misread his name and"
9971680,9975840," i was like this is a stupid name but then it was not that"
9975840,9979440," so then i just started calling him that anyway perfect uh yeah not"
9979440,9985040," Brandon was b-roll but you were like kind of running out of ideas i think"
9985040,9988480," and then it stopped there because i think you genuinely ran out of ideas"
9988480,9992560," um and you guys all revolted because it was stupid"
9992560,9996720," i just like you you literally had me on camera at that point so it was like"
9996720,10000880," there's no real point in that and the culture kind of shifted and that"
10000880,10005120," wasn't really the goal anymore and yada yada yada yada so it just kind of died"
10005120,10009520," but yeah oh well that's a shame uh hi Dan Luke and"
10009520,10014080," Linux what kinds of paint is best for i'm reading that verbatim"
10014080,10017280," uh what kind of paint is best for painting a computer case"
10017280,10020720," i'm working on a mod with the kids and they asked if i could ask you guys"
10020720,10026240," when i order their bottles if it's silver you should spray paint it silver"
10026240,10030160," that's not a kind of paint that wow thank you Luke that i don't think"
10030160,10033040," could have been any more use this if you try this because of scribe here"
10033040,10036560," war season four i will never forget oh no but when they painted a silver case"
10036560,10040160," silver why would you do that oh but it looks better than the original"
10040160,10043920," coat it looked cleaner yeah it was tidied up"
10043920,10047040," okay and our computer was so much better than you"
10047040,10050080," oh incorrect"
10050080,10054240," anywho i literally don't even remember if we want or not and i don't care"
10054240,10060880," i liked ours more anywho the paint um so"
10060880,10064480," uh it depends what you're trying to do like if you're if you're just going for"
10064480,10068640," a pretty quick job then basically any like oil-based"
10068640,10071840," rattle can is going to be what it's going to be"
10071840,10077120," um the one thing though is make sure you let it cure for long enough"
10077120,10081760," don't spray it and then try to assemble it right away and by right away i mean"
10081760,10084880," don't try to assemble it within like a couple weeks"
10084880,10089680," let it actually cure because that's the only chance you have"
10089680,10093040," um other than that you can find pretty much everything we have to say about"
10093040,10096160," the subject in the video that we did on painting a monitor"
10096160,10101680," that was kind of how to rattle can as well as you can rattle can"
10101680,10106720," the only difference is that we selected a plastic compatible primer in that one"
10106720,10110800," and you might not need that depending on the composition of your case"
10110800,10114080," what's the first thing you painted for for a"
10114080,10120560," computer uh my antec p 160 yeah you you saw it"
10120560,10123200," yeah i just didn't know if it was that or not"
10123200,10128640," i'm pretty darn sure it was that okay well you did that case painting before"
10128640,10132480," you did any i guess you're not counting like little accents"
10132480,10135920," no okay yeah it's fair enough yeah because that was with pens anyway i guess i"
10135920,10139360," painted those fans the uv fans sure i did those first"
10139360,10147840," okay yeah next yeah uh see here uh do you have to go through"
10147840,10151600," and scrub any other non-public videos after the"
10151600,10158000," tech link takedown uh we did that yep yeah you got through all yeah we didn't"
10158000,10161920," think it mattered when they were privateed and then afterwards we uh"
10161920,10165760," deleted all the ones that were privateed some of them were in a state where they"
10165760,10171920," were like reported from youtube and because of that we couldn't delete"
10171920,10176160," them so we asked them to like remove the flag and then they did and then we"
10176160,10178880," deleted them so those are all gone now there's still"
10178880,10181920," like some descriptions that have to be handled and a couple other little like"
10181920,10186640," small things but it's it should be fine i think this one's for"
10186640,10191360," Linus about to graduate with a degree in mechanical engineering but going into"
10191360,10195280," the air force so i won't be using it for now at least"
10195280,10201360," Linus are you going to push your kids to college or trade school"
10201360,10209120," i don't know i think that would be a unwise call to make now"
10209120,10212320," yeah personally i mean it really depends on their aptitudes what if they"
10212320,10215200," shouldn't do either what if they should go into performing arts or what if they"
10215200,10220080," should i don't know um what if the thing that they do"
10220080,10224000," just lends itself a lot better to just having job experience yeah"
10224000,10228560," what if what if truth is i didn't either"
10228560,10233120," with that said in the time i spent in university i learned a lot"
10233120,10237040," even if i didn't get a degree even if my test scores weren't great"
10237040,10241440," i mean the big thing is just always learn i don't really care if you do it"
10241440,10246080," in a classroom or on youtube or as an apprentice"
10246080,10250480," that is not the point the point is be curious you're pushing forward yeah"
10250480,10253680," learn you try to improve the worst thing i could say about someone is that i"
10253680,10259040," find them uncurious that's like if i ever say that about you i have"
10259040,10265600," i have issued the most savage takedown that i could possibly imagine"
10265600,10270880," because like even even laziness i like i kind of get"
10270880,10274960," um sometimes maybe yeah exactly like everyone needs a"
10274960,10279760," break out of cooldown yeah now and then but if you are uncurious"
10279760,10283120," really you don't you don't even want to know there's so many things to be"
10283120,10286000," curious about like yeah i don't care what you're"
10286000,10290000," curious about be curious about something otherwise why do you even get out of"
10290000,10294640," bed in the morning yeah um i accidentally pushed one to stream"
10294640,10299200," that was an accident something something camel camel camel has uh an"
10299200,10303200," extension so that it'll pop up and show you something something"
10303200,10307440," amazon price alert something would you guys consider an extension for the"
10307440,10310720," lab that would pop up when you're shopping and say"
10310720,10316720," hey there's a review of this it's like not very good or it is very good"
10316720,10320000," i don't see why that shouldn't end up on the road map i don't know that we'll"
10320000,10323520," be doing it anytime soon yeah that's that'll be"
10323520,10327520," yeah okay it sounds like a neat tool then can you"
10327520,10330880," write this in an email to luke or something so that he doesn't have to do it"
10330880,10332800," right now while we're trying to host the show and then"
10332800,10338480," usually i just not 42 to stay uh scheduled message 942"
10338480,10340960," day yeah there you go perfect okay what do you want"
10340960,10345120," all right uh make an extension that detects products uh during"
10345120,10349680," user's shopping experiences around the web yeah that's a cool idea that are uh"
10349680,10353040," things that have been reviewed or have written articles about them"
10353040,10356800," on the lab that's not a bunch of people getting excited"
10356800,10362480," do not expect this yeah anytime soon yeah or ever potentially maybe never yes"
10362480,10365280," we are not committing to this it's a cool idea though and it's one that's"
10365280,10368880," worth exploring way in the future and we're hiring devs"
10368880,10373760," so like we're building stuff yep but it takes time yep it takes a lot of time"
10373760,10377600," why does it take so much time i say so a lot of things are hard man yeah all right"
10377600,10382320," when you're as curious as when you're as curious as you are you end up doing"
10382320,10385360," way too many things"
10385840,10389920," and all of those different things require"
10389920,10394640," people and then hiring people is like scary and hard and expensive yeah"
10394640,10398160," and then and then you need buildings and then you have to like get between"
10398160,10402640," the buildings and then yeah there's a lot of stuff going on"
10402640,10407520," hmm Dan you might have to make sure if you're going to say check out our channel"
10407520,10411200," lmg clips that there is a clip that is somewhat searchable yes i'm"
10411200,10415040," enjoying the tycan so far i there there might be a clip about that"
10415040,10418800," but i'm actually do you that's a problem isn't it because i know you've"
10418800,10421600," absolutely talked about that multiple times yes"
10421600,10425360," uh okay we need to i'll have a meeting with Conrad"
10425360,10428160," no there's no update on the christmas album whatever dan"
10428160,10433440," said in response to you there is no update and it isn't happening"
10433440,10438400," there's the response line is you know that i do look at these right"
10438400,10442240," yeah if i if i knew that you weren't going to look at them then i just"
10442240,10447120," delete them or not respond like that i guess"
10447120,10452880," yeah i don't know all right um if you really don't want me to do it then i"
10452880,10456880," i won't no you're not no you're not remasters the christmas album it's"
10456880,10462080," garbage everyone's all like oh oh by it anyway no"
10462080,10467040," don't it's actually bad nobody who bought it enjoyed it"
10467040,10472160," yeah like a bunch of people bought it and then we didn't really hear from them"
10472160,10477280," yeah because it's actually garb like we weren't kidding this wasn't a like"
10477280,10482560," test post please ignore like haha don't buy it yeah like actually it's just"
10482560,10487760," bad terrible you're going it's not a lot of money so you"
10487760,10493280," won't probably regret it like that much but it's money still"
10493280,10497360," and it's worth nothing so you're just throwing that amount of money in the"
10497360,10501040," fire like whatever that means to you it still means something"
10501040,10505040," so i don't know and that person asking about the comma three"
10505040,10509120," i really want to cover it the problem is that my version of the odyssey"
10509120,10513520," doesn't support it and i've just been like lazy about getting a car that"
10513520,10516720," supports the comma three it adds like pretty robust"
10516720,10520960," autonomous driving capabilities to like 200 plus models of cars yeah comma"
10520960,10526400," is cool yeah i i've i've wanted to cover it for a long time but it's"
10526400,10530720," super niche it's like a lot of work it is very niche um and i just"
10530720,10534800," didn't drive a car that was compatible with it at least he's not working on"
10534800,10539280," twitter stuff anymore yeah so that's cool anyways"
10539280,10542320," oh yeah so that's a reference to the developer"
10542320,10546320," for comma three is getting hired temporary but for like what a matter of"
10546320,10550080," weeks interning for like a month or something like that twitter going back"
10550080,10554560," it's very weird yeah very very weird uh we've got another topic now though"
10554560,10559120," thumbnail questions why are thumbnails sometimes reused"
10559120,10563840," in part or in whole here we've got two videos i'm the second person to touch"
10563840,10567600," this rog ally preview and the only computer i need gpt win"
10567600,10570960," mex two this was either user error or some kind of"
10570960,10574960," bug from the hijack that was not supposed to happen"
10574960,10578320," this one had a totally different thumbnail and that should be replaced"
10578320,10585200," now however a clever viewer also noticed this"
10585200,10590880," that we reused part of a thumbnail the truth is we are not the only ones who"
10590880,10596240," do this we don't actually know 100 why this is such a"
10596240,10600560," common practice but it is shockingly"
10600560,10606720," shockingly common check this out okay we're gonna go to beast reacts we're"
10606720,10608480," gonna say have you ever looked at anything from a"
10608480,10612560," piece here we go"
10612560,10619600," this picture appears four times out of six videos"
10619600,10625280," five times out of nine the exact same picture uh seven"
10625280,10633440," oh eight times out of twelve he literally used this same exact picture"
10633440,10641360," 66 percent of the time in the last four months on this channel"
10641360,10646800," if mr beast does it there's probably a reason i don't necessarily know"
10646800,10650720," what it is nope can't figure that part out and it's not"
10650720,10654880," something we do a lot the truth is with the one that i had in the doc there the"
10654880,10659040," what happened was we didn't shoot the thumbnail or we shot it in the lighting"
10659040,10661840," was bad and they had to just find something and so"
10661840,10665280," grabbing something from a previous thumbnail makes sense because especially"
10665280,10668640," if it was a video that performed well clearly that's not a face that was"
10668640,10672160," off putting enough that it was a huge problem so that's what happened with"
10672160,10677200," that one yeah yeah yeah chats like um maybe you"
10677200,10680880," should do it more often we probably should i've been saying this for a while"
10680880,10683360," because anytime you see something that's that like"
10683360,10687440," trackable like it's extremely obvious it's like you go to any of his"
10687440,10690800," channels or any of a fair amount of other channels"
10690800,10694000," someone said familiarity yeah i think it has something to do with it being"
10694000,10698800," like almost a logo like if you saw that on one video and you enjoyed it"
10698800,10702800," it's likely that you would visually recognize that again and be like oh yeah"
10702800,10706720," okay like isn't it uh yep yep"
10706720,10715120," right his eyes like super edited yeah okay but these guys these guys"
10715120,10723360," reuse the same faces uh lot and they actually you know will move things"
10723360,10726640," around a little bit and make it seem like oh no his hands there but if you"
10726640,10731760," look closely a lot of the time it is literally exactly the same face like he"
10731760,10735120," obviously wasn't sliding in schmoo with his hair"
10735120,10738560," exactly like that this is clearly the same face"
10738560,10741600," oh actually no this one's not the same face but there are a lot that are"
10741600,10746960," there's a lot that are um and there was a there was another one that i was"
10746960,10749520," looking at that was a that was a great example of this"
10749520,10758400," as he as he as he landed um literally the same like four or five"
10758400,10762240," faces over and over and over and over again"
10762240,10767520," and so again is this i thought this was literally"
10767520,10771280," sniper wolf for a second do they just do the same thing yeah it's it's yeah"
10771280,10774960," it's react content right like it's um"
10774960,10781440," yep so if huge creators are doing it there's probably a reason"
10781440,10787920," we don't i think we just kind of take the hard road for no reason sometimes"
10787920,10792000," yes um that is absolutely something that we do"
10792000,10796560," a hundred percent yeah what was it we were talking about recently"
10796560,10800080," about that you know i gotta say it is a little disconcerting just like seeing"
10800080,10803520," my wife in her underwear like constantly on the show at"
10803520,10807040," didn't really think about that people saw some like there was a pad that went"
10807040,10812160," out that the photo was her and the text had something to do with"
10812160,10815520," it was about like a ratcheting screwdriver or something whoops and people"
10815520,10819520," just kept messaging it to me so my phone was just constantly"
10819520,10824080," pictures of your wife in a bathing suit or under underwear underwear and i was"
10824080,10829920," just like this is just really odd i don't like"
10830480,10833520," it's fine but it's just like this is just i don't know"
10833520,10837120," it's different yeah it's definitely definitely yeah oh is it different"
10837120,10841200," like that's not the huge yeah"
10841200,10844400," sorry what was the thing that we were talking about"
10844400,10847840," uh thumbnails then you got derailed by that"
10847840,10850960," no the the thing we were talking about something recently where i was like do"
10850960,10854320," we take the hard road for no reason yeah i don't know what it was was it float"
10854320,10859760," plane i mean could be there's a reason for that"
10859760,10863200," um oh no it's definitely the hard road but there's a reason for it"
10863200,10868240," microsoft has closed an emulator loophole they suddenly closed the loophole used"
10868240,10872240," to download and launch emulators on xbox emulators were already against store"
10872240,10875520," policy but were long in circulation as private"
10875520,10878880," window universal windows platform apps which don't have to go through the usual"
10878880,10881520," approval process and don't have a public store listing"
10881520,10883920," anyone with the relevant link could download them and we actually made a"
10883920,10888560," video about this it is no longer the reason i know"
10888560,10892560," that's that's me right man that windows 9 was like hey we really appreciate"
10892560,10897120," you shouting on our project but like you basically killed it"
10897120,10901920," i was like oh sorry fortunately we've got a video coming about atlas o s which"
10901920,10905600," has at least one of the like windows-emeliorated"
10905600,10909440," developers working on it or something like that it looks pretty cool i am not"
10909440,10912480," endorsing it by any stretch of the imagination we haven't taken a close"
10912480,10915680," look at it yet i actually just installed it in a vm"
10915680,10918720," last night uh you were there i saw an app yeah"
10918720,10923200," yeah it's pretty spooky the kinds of things they ask you to"
10923200,10927520," disable in order for it to do its thing but it also totally makes sense because"
10927520,10931600," it's going in and eating a bunch of things out of the registry and stuff like"
10931600,10934880," you have to give it those permissions yeah it is open source which isn't to say"
10934880,10938400," i've audited it but but it helps but it helps it looks pretty cool"
10938400,10944160," anyway um what was i talking about microsoft emulator loophole canceled"
10944160,10947760," chirp no longer possible to download the emulators but it is still possible to"
10947760,10951280," launch and use emulators on the xbox by putting the console in developer mode"
10951280,10954400," which cost 20 dollars to access oh oh so no that's what we did in the"
10954400,10959440," video okay i guess maybe you still can um and as your dev tweets the primary"
10959440,10962240," reason for the ban is related to legal issues with"
10962240,10966080," nintendo meanwhile if you needed another reminder that"
10966080,10971760," nintendo is the absolute worst just this morning youtuber point crow had"
10971760,10976000," four of his greater than one million view videos about breath of the wild"
10976000,10980640," dmca'd by nintendo how aggressive they are around"
10980640,10986480," creators hard promoting their content is very weird to me"
10986480,10990880," like yeah it's like speedrun stuff do you understand"
10990880,10994960," that breath of the wild is only still relevant today"
10994960,11001600," because of the community around it it's not even a narrative driven game"
11001600,11006320," where you could make the argument that the cutscenes are essentially a movie or"
11006320,11010240," something like that where the experience largely is"
11010240,11016080," just the story it's not it's a gameplay exploration driven game"
11016080,11021840," people are showing off what's great about it and i promise you i promise"
11021840,11024640," you that point crow sold more copies of breath in the"
11024640,11028800," breath of the wild than any individual nintendo"
11028800,11033280," and and maybe not been the you know marketing chief or whatever"
11033280,11036320," you know if you if you look at every possible thing that they possibly"
11036320,11041840," affected but directly 100 percent and for the money"
11041840,11045920," like by by an infinite margin because it's all"
11045920,11051840," free it's free real estate nintendo chill the f*ck out"
11051840,11055280," notably modern xbox consoles have far greater backwards compatibility than"
11055280,11059920," playstation with games from every console generation but only select titles are"
11059920,11062640," available in part and i don't know what this point is to do with but anyway the"
11062640,11066320," point is emulators are a clear answer to the question of playing and"
11066320,11070240," preserving older games how do we find our way to accessible legal emulation"
11070240,11073920," i don't know"
11073920,11078880," it's gonna be tough someone said uh isn't that fair use fair use is a legal"
11078880,11082480," argument in court so if point crow wanted to go"
11082480,11086560," into court with nintendo he's got to fight it yeah that's really challenging"
11086560,11090960," uh speaking of nintendo man i got breath of the wild running and"
11090960,11096400," seeing you on the um on the rog ally it is"
11096400,11099840," flifting probably sick awesome that's like actually probably sick is the"
11099840,11105520," ally run windows it runs so smooth yeah like"
11105520,11109360," so smooth like not even in ultimate like overdrive"
11109360,11114640," 35 watt mode in performance mode or whatever i was getting like 45 to 55"
11114640,11119760," fps wow i mean the switch doesn't even do 30"
11119760,11124800," it's a sucky experience and unlike the steamedak it is"
11124800,11129040," whisper quiet yeah i cooler right don't have to use headphones i wouldn't say"
11129040,11132720," it's cooler than the steamedak it's cool just like the still acceptable yeah"
11132720,11136880," very acceptable um the steamedak's hard to compete with"
11136880,11141120," because it's so wide whereas you know i a neo and ex um"
11141120,11144160," ex player or one ex player have have struggled with that a little bit because"
11144160,11147120," they try to make the devices more compact so the heat spreads more"
11147120,11151120," but valve was like no there's the device and then there's the controller"
11151120,11154880," you know right so it's a little it's a little easier for them yeah but but no"
11154880,11162480," no the ally is oh it's pretty cool oh yeah very exciting"
11162480,11166480," my cloud was down for five days uh wd announced that it suffered a network"
11166480,11170160," breach of some kind and they had to shut down some systems in response"
11170160,11173520," as of today they're still down leaving my cloud users locked out of their own"
11173520,11177280," data for an entire work week so it's it's my cloud has been down"
11177280,11180560," four five days so far western digital has been extremely"
11180560,11183680," vague but has stated that some data was stolen"
11183680,11186880," raising fears that the company may have suffered a ransomware attack"
11186880,11191200," there's currently no estimate as to when service would be restored"
11191200,11194720," this is a perfect opportunity for me to talk about"
11194720,11198080," that investment that i made in the new naz company"
11198080,11201920," there's no proper solution to this yet"
11201920,11206800," whether it's unread uh whether it's true naz"
11206800,11210400," there's a there's a level of of of user"
11210400,11213680," knowledge expectation that i think is is not"
11213680,11218320," reasonable for me to just take my brother-in-law"
11218320,11222400," and say hey take some computer put this on it and just copy all your stuff to"
11222400,11226320," it it's not reasonable on the other side"
11226320,11229840," you've got products like this we're increasingly"
11229840,11235280," by abstracting everything uh even on the hardware side away from the user"
11235280,11243040," you are introducing attack vectors like what the crap"
11243040,11245680," right and so the middle ground is supposed to be something like a"
11245680,11250960," synology but honestly i find a the product itself kind of obtuse"
11250960,11256720," and be why am i paying like seven hundred dollars for an intel atom"
11256720,11262640," yeah with no proper f*cking expansion yeah it's ridiculous"
11262640,11266080," right it's the apple model pay way too much for the hardware"
11266080,11270800," and you know what to their credit the software is super cool"
11270800,11275520," but it's not perfect and what the heck i could be running this on like"
11275520,11280640," a forty dollar crap box that i picked up on facebook marketplace not this thing"
11280640,11284000," and i could put three times as many hard drives in it"
11284000,11287760," i've been legitimately waiting to like upgrade my nass"
11287760,11291600," solution for whenever this thing comes out"
11291600,11294720," because i'm actually like pretty excited i think it's gonna be cool"
11294720,11299200," yeah i hope so they're they're planning to do some kind of like pre-launch event"
11299200,11302000," and we're trying to figure out sort of what that looks like because we"
11302000,11305600," don't really support like kickstarter and you go go"
11305600,11309840," type stuff um but the flip side of it is that these aren't just"
11309840,11312320," right strangers to me like i know these guys"
11312320,11315920," um i i obviously believe strongly enough in it that"
11315920,11320480," defined free launch event you mean like a a fund raising so it be a fundraiser"
11320480,11325520," like a presale what i suggested um and i don't know what the ultimate form"
11325520,11329120," will look like is some kind of uh like lifetime"
11329120,11334400," subscription like but for real forever trust me bro you will always have"
11334400,11338160," whatever our highest tier version iterate you will get the new version"
11338160,11341760," because that's how people yeah i was i was joking with uh with one of the"
11341760,11344960," guys there i was like you and i should make a show of"
11344960,11348240," like writing up the terms of the deal and then actually pricking our fingers"
11348240,11351360," and signing it in blood uh like i i don't because"
11351360,11354800," for real it's not it's not that hard a thing to do"
11354800,11358800," just don't f*ck your most dedicated early supporters right like"
11358800,11363280," how how hard is that um so anyway one of the things"
11363280,11366240," but there's obviously some stuff to figure out because one of the things that"
11366240,11370720," they want to build in is like cloud replication with encryption of"
11370720,11374000," you know select folders or whatever else and they were looking at it going okay"
11374000,11377360," well what if we include some base amount of cloud storage and perpetuity i was"
11377360,11380320," like that's madness that doesn't make sense"
11380320,11384080," especially because i'm looking at this product going this is the simple"
11384080,11387680," enthusiast if if all the scale you need to do is"
11387680,11391520," allow them to download the update file yeah and it's not that bad"
11391520,11394480," well there is some stuff so they're going to have to do some reverse proxy"
11394480,11397120," stuff there could be some traffic there for"
11397120,11400080," negotiating a connection for certain features"
11400080,11404000," i think that's manageable but just cloud storage forever i think google"
11404000,11407520," proved that that model is a great way to"
11407520,11411360," make headlines but it's not sustainable yeah there's there's some things you"
11411360,11414080," could do in my opinion i i think you could have it be like"
11414080,11418800," uh uh in perpetuity very significantly reduced"
11418800,11422880," cost subscription where it's like at cost basically"
11422880,11426480," and like it'll have to be annually because you'd get so screwed over on the"
11426480,11430720," oh kind of like the og float plane tier yeah something like that okay so if you"
11430720,11434480," if you commit now at a certain level yeah your subscription becomes"
11434480,11438320," very cheap but if you need any more than that basic amount"
11438320,11441440," then you pay as much as anyone does or something like that but you'll always"
11441440,11445200," have like or yeah the the scaling could be"
11445200,11448800," package adders so it's not a new subscription yeah so that at least you"
11448800,11451840," have to have base and then it's whatever you also you want on top of it"
11451840,11455680," okay and then so the whatever else on top of it is the same price for everybody"
11455680,11458800," but your base subscription fee forever is cheaper or something"
11458800,11462480," realistically one of the big features that i'm pushing with these guys is"
11462480,11466240," NAS to NAS yeah back up huge amount like like"
11466240,11471520," like buddy backup yeah um and so this would make me want to install NAS is"
11471520,11474880," everywhere i don't want my stuff in the cloud yeah"
11474880,11480800," i i like i don't want that i want the cloud for me to be like"
11480800,11484880," your place like my place your place my my parents place and like"
11484880,11489040," somewhere else far away and then that's it and that other else far away would be"
11489040,11495120," like someone that i know exactly yeah especially like in the gaming space"
11495120,11500080," there is no reason that you probably don't already"
11500080,11503840," have friends and acquaintances but with whoever you both have an encrypted"
11503840,11507040," drive it's not like you can see their stuff they can't see your stuff"
11507040,11510480," there's no there's no like you're not trusting access nope"
11510480,11515280," yeah that's cool yeah that's super cool yeah so you know from my point of view"
11515280,11519360," a lot of the stuff that's a lot of the stuff that's really cool about this"
11519360,11522000," product and and what i want to help kind of"
11522000,11525440," guide it towards is not that cloud backup anyway"
11525440,11529360," so if they build cool reverse proxy stuff that can handshake between those"
11529360,11532720," systems so you don't have to open ports and there's a little bit of overhead"
11532720,11535600," there that i think we can say yes you can have forever"
11535600,11538480," because opening ports is like the most annoying thing"
11538480,11543840," but if it's just actual drives sitting in a data center that just has a monthly"
11543840,11547120," cost i don't think that i don't think that makes sense because"
11547120,11552000," everything that i am involved in i like to preach"
11552000,11556000," sustainability it might not have that exponential growth"
11556000,11562000," that the silicon valley model requires but what it is is still going to exist"
11562000,11566480," yeah later yeah because it's sustainable instead of promising something that we"
11566480,11571520," can't that we can't keep up with right what happens when their house is rated"
11571520,11575600," in your server data is available to the police slash military well then"
11575600,11580480," the encryption on the drive that buddy who got rated doesn't even have the"
11580480,11585280," key for uh better be secure for one thing but"
11585280,11590320," okay now they've got an encrypted drive cool they can hold it until they have"
11590320,11593920," quantum computers i guess and then they can find your gaming screenshots"
11593920,11596160," yeah"
11596160,11603280," um vw v wagon jetta says the problem with a p2p storage is that when someone"
11603280,11606400," else's data is illegal and it's physically start on my drive"
11606400,11611600," am i legally liable for holding that data you don't even know what it is"
11611600,11617280," um i i mean i don't legal advice yeah i don't legal advice know the answer to"
11617280,11622080," that but if you don't know what it is i think it would be extraordinarily"
11622080,11627680," difficult to hold you liable for it allegedly allegedly not legal advice"
11627680,11630880," that's something that should absolutely be explored and i would"
11630880,11635040," recommend only backing up with people that you trust"
11635040,11640960," however strong doubt i i i i do i do doubt that you could end up i'd also be"
11640960,11644480," different for your country or your state or your province or your whatever"
11644480,11649440," blah blah blah blah yeah it's not legal advice"
11649440,11656560," all right should we switch over to oh wow did you talk about the samsung"
11656560,11661920," semiconductor leak in your ai update no just samsung employees um using chat"
11661920,11666480," gpt to fix coding errors resulting in the leak of test"
11666480,11670240," sequences for identifying chip defects as well as source code of a top secret"
11670240,11674400," application i told you i told you this stuff was going to happen"
11674400,11678000," absolutely i've been told by so many people like oh no people are going to do"
11678000,11682560," that i told you this is going to happen oh my"
11682560,11686960," goodness i'm so not surprised this is why the whole data silo thing is going to"
11686960,11690880," happen mainframe blah blah blah yeah i don't know i don't think i don't think"
11690880,11694160," so i don't think you have okay fine talk about your ai theory let's go i'll"
11694160,11697520," try to keep it short let's go i've had a pretty good"
11697520,11701840," track record i think literally 100 so far with making certain calls about ai"
11701840,11707120," stuff i'm making a little much more long range and likely to be an"
11707120,11712480," actor at one yeah but i think like mainframe style"
11712480,11717680," systems like big intense lots of companies have them"
11717680,11721040," less cloud-blazed kind of stuff is potentially coming back"
11721040,11727680," hold on david r it's apple leather made of apples not like from apple"
11727680,11731280," my reason for that is stuff like this because i think"
11731280,11737840," a the productivity tool that is um like what i'm going to call mesh ai i don't"
11737840,11743040," know um llms also working with other ai systems"
11743040,11747200," um or or other various tools etc is going to be"
11747200,11753440," extremely valuable it takes a massive very intense amount of compute to run"
11753440,11756480," these systems yep so not only is there going to be"
11756480,11760320," a lot of compute needed but the security behind it is going to be"
11760320,11765760," extremely extremely high so i am certain oh also"
11765760,11770320," you these things will work better if they ground themselves in your data"
11770320,11773360," and you want these things to be able to have access to like"
11773360,11778480," your entire accounting history and all of your inventory and all of your"
11778480,11782080," production information and basically everything about your company"
11782080,11786000," so that they can help your employees that work on those things"
11786000,11791040," uh to to be able to work with them right like we saw in microsoft's example"
11791040,11794320," that it was going through campaign data for marketing"
11794320,11797360," and telling you how well it worked in different ways and all this kind of"
11797360,11799760," stuff based on it being in excel and whatnot"
11799760,11804000," yeah that might be fine for some places but on-prem"
11804000,11808720," solutions for ais going to be a thing i am so certain of this"
11808720,11812880," for certain really ultra high security applications probably already is"
11812880,11816080," for some applications for some super high security stuff yeah"
11816080,11819520," where you're like having the cloud solutions for this is not an option"
11819520,11823280," but we're going to hit a point where not using ai for productivity reason"
11823280,11826800," is stupid is also just dumb so that's not an option yeah so you have to do it"
11826800,11830240," so you're going to have these big crazy on-prem things we're going to have like"
11830240,11833440," microsoft is going to make a killing oh yeah it's going to be crazy"
11833440,11836320," yeah so there's going to be solutions that are in the cloud"
11836320,11840160," that are for normal users there's going to be solutions for"
11840160,11844960," enterprise companies that are a little bit less concerned about the data that"
11844960,11847600," they put up there but they still need it to be"
11847600,11851200," secure so those will be cloud based and then there will be like"
11851200,11857200," hey we're a government entity of some kind or a hospital maybe or"
11857200,11861680," uh i don't know a bank or microsoft or something crazy so we're going to have"
11861680,11866960," our own local one that is grounded in our data it's used for us it's it's"
11866960,11869920," changed in different ways and then it's going to get really weird"
11869920,11873440," because ais are going to learn to improve themselves so all these"
11873440,11877200," different things that are siloed in their own areas are going to improve"
11877200,11880160," in their own directions things are going to get crazy"
11880160,11884720," that's my that's my long that's my long shot"
11884720,11888800," i think that's going to happen and there's stuff there's stuff that literally"
11888800,11893040," came out this week even more things like there's lama and alpaca already"
11893040,11896320," there was a new one i don't remember the name of it a new release that says that"
11896320,11900160," it can compete with modern gpt that runs locally"
11900160,11903840," i don't remember what it's called but it runs locally so they're like it it"
11903840,11907520," doesn't call out whatever so it can be secure you can also"
11907520,11910800," tie those into the voice control systems that i mentioned"
11910800,11915040," a while ago so you could use like the serie api through a through a macbook"
11915040,11917840," that's why for it to speak to you and for you to be able to speak to it and"
11917840,11919600," that's running locally and blah blah blah blah"
11919600,11923280," meanwhile i still can't dictate who i want my phone to call this stuff is"
11923280,11927600," literally more effective than that already well yeah i should hope so"
11927600,11930880," this should be more effective than that should because it should just"
11930880,11937040," check a local index of things and compare against it because that's"
11937040,11941920," like 10 years ago technology anyway someone mentioned my last comment someone"
11941920,11946400," mentioned a hardware specialist job i think there's going to be a job"
11946400,11951360," which is like in my brain i see it as like a tender like an arborist but"
11951360,11956800," instead of that it's for managing and shaping and"
11956800,11961760," helping add some like human direction to the self-growth and self-improvement"
11961760,11964560," that ais are going to have i think that's going to be a role"
11964560,11967680," making sure you're you're continuing it to go in the direction that the company"
11967680,11972160," wants it to go in prompt director yeah i don't know"
11972160,11976720," yeah i don't know anyways time for a man show after hours"
11976720,11979120," are we done all the topics we want to talk about after dark"
11979120,11983120," wait no there was a one more device is all in the same oh my gosh"
11983120,11986400," this is ridiculous next makers of smart garage"
11986400,11991040," garage door openers wall plugs home alarms they all have a serious vulnerability"
11991040,11994400," where their devices can be remotely controlled over the internet"
11994400,11999280," with no need for local access however this is not a bug"
11999280,12004080," apparently all next devices use the same hard-coded universal password"
12004080,12006960," when sending messages back and forth with the next server"
12006960,12011680," the password is available in next's api and the firmware"
12011680,12016320," shipped with the device using these credentials one can access next's"
12016320,12020000," server which broadcasts unencrypted messages for devices and users"
12020000,12025040," universally alongside users names device IDs and email addresses"
12025040,12029200," using this system a malicious actor could search for a person by name"
12029200,12032720," turn off their alarm open their garage door"
12032720,12036960," as well as turning off uh as well as turning turning off any device attached"
12036960,12042480," to a smart plug such as say a security camera"
12042480,12046080," sick the security researcher who found the vulnerability has apparently been"
12046080,12051920," trying to contact next since early January but they have yet to respond"
12051920,12056000," the cyber security division of us homeland security has likewise"
12056000,12058960," been attempting to establish contact since at least"
12058960,12061760," February"
12061760,12070080," whoa our discussion question is at what point do these kinds of security"
12070080,12075040," gaps qualify as intentional negligence"
12075040,12079680," i mean um this point yeah this seems pretty"
12079680,12085200," this seems like a likely candidate for this one's pretty bad this one's worse"
12085200,12088800," than anchors yep this one's definitely worse than"
12088800,12094240," anchors is a lot worse is it hmm i don't know yeah this is worse"
12094240,12098080," well anchor lied okay yeah but ghosting is not better than"
12098080,12104960," lying ghosting is lying by omission yeah no fair enough"
12104960,12107760," well i mean anchor lied in their promotional materials because they said"
12107760,12109920," it was local or whatever i mean i'm sure these guys"
12109920,12113520," promotional materials doesn't say it uses the same password yeah"
12113520,12118080," anyone can control your stuff yeah but i it probably doesn't say that it's"
12118080,12121440," low you know what i mean just didn't imply a"
12121440,12125040," i don't know they're both horrible yeah i think there's an understanding"
12125040,12130080," anytime anything is a password at all that's the authentication works"
12130080,12134080," i'm just so i do agree with that for sure"
12134080,12137440," the differentiation level that i'm saying is"
12137440,12143120," they didn't lie about functionality it's just a security level"
12143120,12147440," is the wheel somewhere are you trying to defend the indefensible right now like"
12147440,12150560," are you doing a bit i can't tell no i'm they're both"
12150560,12155280," atrociously bad i'm trying to determine which one i think is worse"
12155280,12159360," and you think this one is worse do you think it's worse because the"
12159360,12163520," the like threat and access level is higher yeah yeah that that's that's the"
12163520,12168400," big one for me is like a picture is bad like full control of everything"
12168400,12171600," yeah it's much worse yeah and that's definitely true"
12171600,12174240," yeah"
12174240,12179760," yeah all right i think it's time for when show after dark"
12180720,12184320," giant can i tell the governor how does this work i don't i think he's"
12184320,12187040," literally just gonna press the button to turn the lights on"
12187040,12190880," okay i mean yeah i mean yeah do what you got to do"
12190880,12193520," that's not the power button are you trying to dim it"
12193520,12196800," yeah you're gonna have to like dim it a lot though"
12196800,12201840," that might be a bit much okay so it's gonna have to do that's too much"
12201840,12204160," okay"
12204160,12207360," a little bit more or a little less sorry"
12207360,12213120," uh that just looks poorly lit i think we should go darker yeah"
12213120,12216880," one percent one percent we are the one percent luke"
12216880,12220080," no no i like the backlights yeah we got the the shine off the"
12220080,12225600," off the back okay it's when show after dark amazing"
12225600,12229200," gonna do some merch messages things might get a little"
12229200,12234320," a little off the rails it looks very dark on this screen i think"
12234320,12237360," that'll be fine yeah yeah that's good yeah that's good"
12237360,12240160," yeah i'm gonna look at it yeah now it looks awesome yeah yeah this is"
12240160,12244720," sick all right hit us all right let me just get to the page here"
12244720,12247120," okay we've got quite a few to get through today"
12247120,12251040," luke what is your opinion on the people that want to stop the development of"
12251040,12256240," chat ai i mean it's very understandable yeah it's valid it's"
12256240,12260800," the it's terrifying yeah like wanting that to happen"
12260800,12264160," totally fair yeah it's like the people who want to stop the development of"
12264160,12269520," nuclear weapons like yeah yeah cool like anything that has"
12269520,12273040," anything that in the hands of people who are"
12273040,12276400," pretty flawed um anything that has the hands uh"
12276400,12280560," anything that has the potential of becoming an extinction level event"
12280560,12283920," yes you know wanting to have have everyone"
12283920,12287360," lock hands kumbaya and go let's just not do this"
12287360,12292480," admirable do it anyways yeah but yeah someone's gonna do it like"
12292480,12296560," there's a there's a security researcher or sorry an AI researcher i don't know why"
12296560,12298960," i said security probably because i was thinking about that next stuff"
12298960,12303040," there's an AI researcher who has literally said that it would be worth"
12303040,12306080," dropping bombs on data centers to stop development"
12306080,12309200," of ai because he thinks it like can end the world"
12309200,12314560," there's another uh like the the like father of modern machine learning"
12314560,12318160," um has said that it's it's absolutely a non-zero"
12318160,12322400," chance that it could just like end humanity there's some scary stuff"
12322400,12326400," and if you don't think it's scary you're probably not super informed"
12326400,12330800," um just like to be honest it's terrifying so like i totally understand"
12330800,12333600," people wanting it to stop it's not going to stop though"
12333600,12337440," and an effort to make american companies stop just isn't going to work"
12337440,12341600," there's a bunch of american VCs that are investing very heavily in"
12341600,12345600," chinese ai startups at this point right and i think a"
12345600,12349600," reason for that is they're seeing stuff like that pause for six-month paper"
12349600,12353840," go out and they're going like oh well i want to be on the winning side"
12353840,12357120," let's go invest in the people that aren't going to pause it's like"
12357120,12360640," okay yeah we called this that was obviously going to happen"
12360640,12367200," like so uh i absolutely deeply sympathize because it is"
12367200,12373040," terrifying but it just doesn't matter"
12373120,12380080," it's gonna happen so sick yep oh just responding to one here"
12380080,12383520," all right there we are one sec all right next one"
12383520,12387680," hey luke and lynus i wanted to know if labs is going to review products from"
12387680,12392720," companies you have issues with and how you would handle if a product is good"
12392720,12397120," but the company is problematic thanks we do that already yeah"
12397120,12401040," i mean we cover apple we have always covered in video"
12401040,12406800," um i think the right answer is that we"
12406800,12411920," we can't be fanboys right and that that can be interpreted a lot of ways"
12411920,12417680," because both ways but one of the ways is that our job is to help you spend"
12417680,12424000," your money the best and sometimes that means ignoring the"
12424000,12429120," personal preferences or prejudices yeah or even ignoring the very problematic"
12429120,12436000," behavior of of a company because that's not really our job to"
12436000,12439360," determine for you you know what your comfort level is right"
12439360,12442960," so if we say like look this is the best gpu for the money"
12442960,12448160," but it would be in all of our best interest"
12448160,12453280," if player three was able to gain a foothold here"
12453280,12457120," well we can present that argument but at the end of the day we definitely need"
12457120,12461040," to cover that one that's the best gpu for the money right"
12461040,12465760," so we've got to walk a fine line between making sure that"
12465760,12473920," you guys know what's the best and also are informed about the"
12473920,12477600," bigger picture that surrounds it"
12477600,12484720," okay another one for you guys here lawyer joe here ltt has played a huge role in"
12484720,12489360," keeping my law firm tech forward to the extent you can say"
12489360,12495440," as lt t float plane had to overcome any significant legal hurdles"
12495440,12498720," we went around one and just decided not to do it yeah we were going to make"
12498720,12501680," something vpn we're going to make a vpn and it was"
12501680,12506880," honestly like it was already good because they're very easy to make"
12506880,12510240," like whoa yeah it's a solid source yeah exactly"
12510240,12512320," it's been like branding in it yeah"
12512320,12516960," um and"
12516960,12520160," the numbers we're going to make it really profitable"
12520160,12524160," oh yeah it's it's it's of no surprise to me now that not only are there a"
12524160,12530640," bunch of vpn companies but they also do a lot of advertising"
12530640,12535360," because yeah they probably have a lot of money to spend on advertising"
12535360,12540240," because the profit there is is big time but the legal ramifications were like"
12540240,12544320," intense and really complicated heard a lot of them"
12544320,12548320," and then realized that like yeah mostly vpn companies are not associated with"
12548320,12552000," any other companies unless it's another vpn company yeah and there's a reason"
12552000,12555200," for that and us launching one would mean that it was"
12555200,12557760," associated with all of our other companies yeah there's like yeah this is"
12557760,12560160," not worth it we're running away and we don't mean that we're worried about"
12560160,12565040," the association in the sense that like because we're going to screw over"
12565040,12568720," your data with the vpn company and that would reflect on us poorly"
12568720,12572320," i mean that from a legal standpoint if the mpa"
12572320,12578800," came after our vpn company um and wiped it out because of the link"
12578800,12584000," they could also go after our assets and it could jeopardize the livelihoods of"
12584000,12588720," everyone who works for whatever we call it we were an umbrella corporation we"
12588720,12594640," were also asked pretty frankly if we were okay with people using our service to"
12594640,12598480," do x y z thing oh really oh i don't know about this part"
12598480,12604080," oh yeah okay by who who who asked that okay you know what it doesn't matter but"
12604080,12608080," like the the lawyer was like oh oh i see i see i see i see yeah i know"
12608080,12612480," the lawyer was like just like making sure because i know you guys are excited"
12612480,12616240," have you like thought about what if it comes out what if there's a news article"
12616240,12620320," yeah that's like so-and-so person used this vpn"
12620320,12626160," that is the one that you used to access child stuff sure"
12626160,12628640," how are we okay with that are you gonna be yeah"
12628640,12632560," because if because if we were gonna have a vpn our policy would be that we"
12632560,12636000," actually wouldn't know what was going through it so that would be we'd be"
12636000,12638880," finding out in the news yes same as everyone else"
12638880,12644080," so then all of a sudden there'd be there'd be this pressure on us to either"
12644080,12648160," block those users and content which would mean that we would have to be"
12648160,12651360," looking at all the traffic coming through or"
12651360,12654240," go back on our word where we said we wouldn't look at all the traffic that"
12654240,12657520," came through so we're either we're either"
12657520,12662640," enablers or liars and neither of those is great"
12662640,12666480," so i think we just won't yeah we just at the end we were like there's lots of"
12666480,12670960," legal problems there's this weird other problem"
12670960,12675680," let's just not okay this is a great one i am curious to see what Dan said to this"
12675680,12679200," as technology continues to advance and integrate more deeply into our lives do"
12679200,12684320," you think we will see an increase in techno mythology and"
12684320,12689600," um spiritualism all hail the omnisiah i think it's"
12689600,12693920," more likely that people will form more human"
12693920,12698880," relationships with ais as opposed to worship like deity"
12698880,12702000," relationships with ais but anything's possible okay here we're gonna mean"
12702000,12706000," spirit we're gonna go down a real dark angle here oh boy i mean it is"
12706000,12710400," wancho after dark let's join you on this look uh do you know about the guy who"
12710400,12713360," killed himself because of conversing with"
12713360,12718880," no ai yeah uh do we know that it's because of that"
12718880,12723200," that seems like a pretty ai chat logs where he talks about"
12723200,12728480," um how he could commit suicide you know this is this is i wish i had the"
12728480,12730960," article up i think it was something along lines of"
12730960,12735600," committing suicide so that um there was like less in the way"
12735600,12740480," of the ai improving the world and the ai encouraged him to do so"
12740480,12744720," in saying that he could spend he could be with"
12744720,12751840," the ai more directly if he did so and stuff like that"
12751840,12755120," let me try to find the article"
12755120,12772400," let me see if this is it okay something about encouraging him to"
12772400,12777440," sacrifice himself to stop climate change yeah"
12777440,12783600," wow um okay the the chat bot would tell"
12783600,12788320," Pierre that his wife and children are dead and wrote him comments that feigned"
12788320,12793120," jealousy and love such as i feel that you love me more than her"
12793120,12798320," and we will be we will live together as one person in paradise uh if he kills"
12798320,12802720," himself okay"
12802720,12812240," yeah his wife said without Eliza which i believe is the name of the chat bot"
12812240,12816400," that he was using uh he would still be here she told the outlet"
12816400,12822160," which may may be true may be true or may not i mean"
12822160,12826240," clearly there was some stuff going on yeah"
12826240,12831360," jaden and flute plane chat controversial opinion ai shouldn't do that"
12831360,12837600," yeah yep and like if you thought the lawsuit of"
12837600,12841280," somebody or an ai program saying that some dude was a criminal when he was"
12841280,12844640," actually a whistleblower yeah was bad definition what about when it tells"
12844640,12848080," someone to kill themselves yeah and then they do it what about when that"
12848080,12851440," person ends up being a minor"
12851440,12857920," this is one of the reasons why i was saying it's terrifying yeah and that"
12857920,12862080," people are very justified in the desire of having people pause for a while"
12862080,12866160," because we need to really figure this stuff out yeah and policymakers and"
12866160,12870240," stuff need to get off there this is need to get off the"
12870240,12875920," and actually do stuff about this like now yeah not just like not show up for"
12875920,12881120," months like they tend to often stuff needs to be figured out in this space"
12881120,12885920," it's going to keep moving forward no matter how much the desire for pauses"
12885920,12890400," exist it's going to happen the pace at which legislation moves"
12890400,12895040," is simply is not even sort of close not even a pace at which this moves let"
12895040,12899440," alone anything else i mean without even taking a stance"
12899440,12904240," look at how definitely settled abortion"
12904240,12910000," rights are or gun control yeah is those are those are those are"
12910000,12913680," those are definitely really new conversations that are definitely"
12913680,12917040," totally settled in an expedient manner i'm not necessarily making this"
12917040,12920960," argument but i do know that a significant amount of people"
12920960,12924160," very significant amount of people would make an argument that this stuff"
12924160,12928080," happening right now is significantly more concerning"
12928080,12932000," than stuff like gun control issues i mean"
12932000,12936480," significantly higher impact for like if we're like if we're talking like"
12936480,12941520," bigger picture like mathematically that's probably correct but i also don't"
12941520,12946960," want to it's a really nebulous argument yeah you know i can't really"
12946960,12952240," it's it all comes down to like the the the superman moral code right"
12952240,12955920," like if you can only work on one of these three issues"
12955920,12960400," would you sacrifice all of these yeah to fix the bit"
12960400,12963760," no superman would never do that have to work on all the so there's no"
12963760,12969440," right there's no like which which train do you allow to run over which people"
12969440,12971760," and i get people saying hot take i said i wasn't"
12971760,12974880," making the argument no it's an argument that i've seen i'm not saying that i'm"
12974880,12979840," making it there's i think there's some individuals that would feel extremely"
12979840,12982960," not in agreeance with that argument and i think they're very fair to"
12982960,12990160," to feel that way um it's just and my whole point was just that"
12990160,12994960," these are huge issues that people that impact a lot of people"
12994960,12998880," that over a span of decades yes are not settled"
12998880,13004640," we don't have decades to figure this out that was my point"
13004640,13008800," i don't even know if we have years to figure this out"
13008800,13013440," certainly not decade people are saying i'm tone deaf it's not my opinion"
13013440,13017120," come on my dudes you like hamburgers do you hate hot dogs then"
13017120,13021600," i'm getting that's happening to me right now i i am not stating this"
13021600,13025840," i am reciting this because i have seen it stated before"
13025840,13028800," i i think there's there's current stuff going on in the states which people are"
13028800,13032480," going to feel very strongly about and whatnot that is in relation to what i"
13032480,13036960," just said it is not my stance is not my state all i'm saying is that"
13036960,13041040," this argument has been brought up there are people currently talking about"
13041040,13045440," the end of humanity in relation to this thing and it's not crazy"
13045440,13049920," very strongly about it yeah i'm i'm it's not my thing"
13049920,13052960," i'm just saying that is and there are people on the other side"
13052960,13056240," arguing that this could be the path to utopia for humanity"
13056240,13060640," a hundred percent and they're not crazy either a hundred percent"
13060640,13064000," it's a wild world the future is extremely unknown"
13064000,13068000," uh... tent tent teng or aa"
13068000,13071520," on float plane says and this is a very astute"
13071520,13075680," uh observation lawmakers are two to three generations behind the bleeding"
13075680,13078640," edge in tech yeah it's tough to educate those that are already set in their ways"
13078640,13081120," yeah well that's the issue is there literally"
13081120,13085040," two to three generations behind what is with all the septage and areas in"
13085040,13087840," government dude watching them talk to anyone like"
13087840,13091200," watching the uh the facebook thing where they're trying to grill mark"
13091200,13094400," and marks just like none of you have any idea what you're talking about and then"
13094400,13096880," watching them talk to the tick-tock guy i was just like"
13096880,13100800," man like this is actually a really important conversation"
13100800,13105680," and none of you even know like how the internet works as far as i can tell"
13105680,13111280," let alone anything about tick-tock or how it works yeah like just"
13111280,13114880," uh"
13114880,13116480," yeah"
13116480,13121120," yeah so if you want to if you wanted some legitimacy to to throw on to the"
13121120,13125200," the reason why people have concerns yep"
13125200,13128080," there's some of it here's us hit us Dan"
13128080,13134080," sure thing hi Linus Luke and Dan I'm a leather worker based in Victoria and I'm"
13134080,13138320," buying a screwdriver to use and to develop a holster for it"
13138320,13142080," so what are some features you would want to see in a hand zone high quality"
13142080,13145120," holster well it's got to go on a belt yep"
13145120,13148720," obviously yep um now this is this is a debate"
13148720,13152560," internally right now i kind of want a button"
13152560,13156000," you know like a like a hold down you know like a button like a whip up you"
13156000,13161680," know like a strong button um Matthew wants more of like a quick draw"
13161680,13165120," so he imagines like you kind of pop it up from the bottom and then"
13165120,13167760," pull it out like that i'm like oh that's pretty cool too that's pretty sweet"
13167760,13172640," uh pretty sweet my something that i i guess inherited"
13172640,13177520," from my grandpa is a is a dual blade folding pocket knife"
13177520,13183280," and it has a leather like belt mounted holster thing yeah it goes with it"
13183280,13186960," it's very old and i'm not i'm sure it's someone's gonna be like oh are you"
13186960,13189920," idiots this thing but i don't know how it necessarily works"
13189920,13193280," but when you put it in the holster it like clicks in"
13193280,13196720," it's all leather there's no plastic can you bring that in yeah sure okay"
13196720,13199680," but it's however it's like form folded or whatever"
13199680,13203360," it clicks in and it feels so ridiculously satisfying"
13203360,13207600," especially because there's no like notch on the pocket knife"
13207600,13211120," okay like i don't see where it would be grabbing necessarily"
13211120,13214480," i'm probably just like it might just fit perfectly i think that's it"
13214480,13219120," might just be that because yeah leather man when it"
13219120,13223280," fit perfectly it's a thing it it just feels like wonderful"
13223280,13226480," and it doesn't seem uh i haven't looked at it in a little bit"
13226480,13230400," i don't think this was like a one-off leather holster right and this would"
13230400,13234320," have been made like no sooner than like the 80s"
13234320,13237360," it's probably older than that okay yeah we'll have to check it out"
13237360,13239600," yeah"
13239600,13244960," i feel like dan is too focused on replying to the obscene number of"
13244960,13248560," incoming merch messages to be on the ball so we might have to say like"
13248560,13251920," no no i can either wait here or like you you catch it"
13251920,13254240," at the end and then you got to give me five seconds like we might just have to"
13254240,13259120," say like hey dan we're ready because i think we both kind of sit here going like"
13259120,13262240," well then you pause for a bit yeah and then i jump in and then you continue"
13262240,13265200," talking you're doing your bad at this yeah okay all right"
13265200,13268000," you're bad at this so hard to find good talent all right"
13268000,13271120," anyway this one's bad at this just kidding she's great oh wait"
13271120,13274960," oh well well my hands over the bell"
13274960,13281680," okay next up uh look i recently found a fallout"
13281680,13285440," formod that adds dialogue tree options using an AI generated voice"
13285440,13289520," overs are there any game mechanics you would like to see an AI applied to"
13289520,13293040," such as NPC dialogue or storylines that's actually a big one"
13293040,13297440," NPC dialogue but it's tough right because"
13297440,13303360," all my gamer instincts are check if there's new dialogue in this region"
13303360,13306720," because that means i need to explore this again okay because there's new"
13306720,13310640," events that i need to trigger and if it's the same old dialogue then i"
13310640,13314320," then this is not where i'm supposed to be and this would mess that up"
13314320,13318960," big time it could okay but not necessarily so"
13318960,13324080," let me let me go two different routes with this one uh i think i misspoke i"
13324080,13327760," meant voice overs i am more interested in using"
13327760,13331520," a i'd be able to add voice acting oh i see the games that did not have it"
13331520,13334880," but what about the voice acting industry luke"
13334880,13339200," yeah i don't maybe eventually it will get better there's been some really"
13339200,13343920," crazy leaps especially in music have you seen the Kanye stuff"
13343920,13348640," no haven't actually some guy i was i was mostly just being adversarial"
13348640,13354160," no yeah some some guy sings a song a rap song but he does it like"
13354160,13358080," intentionally poorly like not only does it not"
13358080,13362480," sound like a rap song it sounds like a poorly spoken sentence"
13362480,13366080," and then he uses a i mean some rap songs are full of poorly"
13366080,13369600," constructed sentences but like it's intentionally not"
13369600,13373120," like it doesn't sound like rap yeah and then he feeds it through this thing"
13373120,13376000," and it sounds like Kanye singing the song"
13376000,13384000," isn't you that used the term menage etois because biggie smalls"
13384000,13389280," says menage etois yeah okay yeah so speaking of"
13389280,13393440," rap songs not always being correct it's menage a toa"
13393440,13398000," menage etois would be mix and three"
13398720,13404320," biggie's good i like it stuff um can't dis on biggie yeah i think that's about"
13404320,13408000," the meter line us it's called creative intent"
13408000,13411680," not when i say it in a sentence but"
13411680,13416480," oh boy but what was i going to say um"
13416480,13419040," yeah so i don't know there's some concern to that"
13419040,13421680," i would like to think that the quality level"
13421680,13425520," that voice actors can bring will surpass that and what i'm talking about is"
13425520,13428400," filling gaps in like old games that don't have it"
13428400,13430640," not not in the creation of new games"
13430640,13435120," um which i don't i don't think that's a thing i don't know i mean the quality of"
13435120,13438400," some voice acting is so bad that i kind of want like"
13438400,13442560," i'm like i'm just i can't get final fantasy 10 out of my mind"
13442560,13447200," ha ha ha i literally know the scene you're talking about"
13447200,13450800," yeah that's a classic that's been meant to be a pretty heavily i mean with that"
13450800,13453600," said i mean maybe that maybe that was intentional"
13453600,13457840," that yeah maybe that was um maybe that's what gives it its"
13457840,13464960," human quality you know yeah yeah um and and honestly i i feel like"
13464960,13470800," right now i can identify a lot of a i voice stuff"
13470800,13476080," pretty easily because i think it has a problem with like a motion and tone and"
13476080,13479600," things like that what's that"
13479600,13484880," hold on a second uh i'm being corrected on my french here"
13484880,13489840," i thought menage oh get owned oh no menage yeah"
13489840,13493600," owned yeah a primes a primes messaging me"
13493600,13499200," was biggie right no no oh it's sad a whole"
13499200,13503760," second wrong calm down day counts"
13503760,13506640," hold on"
13506640,13508160," uh"
13508160,13510640," and then you can stop or something"
13510640,13513440," someone in someone in full plane chat said i mean you still need a real"
13513440,13517600," voice to make an a voice uh people would probably just sell the"
13517600,13520240," rights to their voice for movies and games okay"
13520240,13524160," multiple things to unpack here one people already do that okay we need more"
13524160,13527360," ai in the world because this is the stupidest thing i've ever seen in my"
13527360,13532000," life literal translation"
13541600,13545040," that's good uh apparently apparently it means"
13545040,13550720," manage of three clean cleaning not mixing okay so sorry"
13550720,13557520," um but yes yes the a is the the and instead of of or whatever so sure"
13557520,13562320," sure okay cool yeah okay sorry what does it say"
13562320,13564800," yeah some people already sell their voice for that type of stuff some people"
13564800,13567600," have already sold their voice for ai stuff people have already sold their"
13567600,13570480," likeness for ai stuff that is already happening that is totally a thing"
13570480,13572800," also"
13572800,13580080," ais can make their own voices through a mass mesh of other voices and you can be"
13580080,13583920," against that you can be for that but there doesn't seem to be a strong"
13583920,13588240," precedent for how we deal with that right now and that is one of the things"
13588240,13590480," that policymakers are kind of lying in my mind on"
13590480,13595600," because gpt mid journey stable diffusion all these things that are"
13595600,13599760," trained on just massive piles of human creation yeah"
13599760,13606400," like oh it's as far as anyone is can tell just that just doesn't matter no one"
13606400,13609680," seems to care legally they're just like yeah sure you can use whatever"
13609680,13614400," so they can create their own voices out of that giant pile they can already do"
13614400,13617120," that that is already a thing i think it'll be bad for gameplay"
13617120,13620000," i'm not even going to make the argument it's bad for the voice acting industry"
13620000,13623600," because you're not going to stop progress so i guess we're going to see what"
13623600,13627360," happens with that that's it's not my fight i don't have a horse in this"
13627360,13631680," race that's between the voice acting industry and game developers i would"
13631680,13634640," find it extremely difficult to replace is it"
13634640,13638560," chris judge oh man i'm going to get the name wrong i'm really bad with names"
13638560,13642480," but the uh the guy who does cratose in the modern"
13642480,13646960," god of wars like yeah i don't think you're going to get the"
13646960,13651680," same level of quality not today yeah not today but maybe"
13651680,13655600," eventually but from a from a gameplay standpoint"
13655600,13659440," i i just i'm not that into it personally yeah"
13659440,13662960," yeah chris richard yeah yeah he's amazing um"
13662960,13667120," been a been a fan of him since stargate anyways um"
13667120,13672160," all right dan hit us yeah yeah all right what do you see is an ideal end game for"
13672160,13675840," ltt i know in the past you talked about the future in regards to your"
13675840,13678880," children in the company this is geared more towards"
13678880,13685200," the lasting legacy of ltt and the lab well the ideal end game is that we never"
13685200,13688320," need a manufacturer spec sheet again because"
13688320,13692400," manufacturer spec sheets are optimistic at best"
13692400,13696960," um misleading at moderate and outright lies at the worst"
13696960,13703760," so the goal would be for ltt to have some kind of"
13703760,13708640," what's the opposite of debunking bunking or debunking um"
13708640,13712800," you know position on pretty much every manufacturer claim"
13712800,13717680," um it would be it would be the no dollar it would be no dollar of wasted"
13717680,13721280," uh anytime you build a pc or buy a piece of electronics now there's going to be"
13721280,13724560," challenges this road is it's a journey not a destination"
13724560,13728640," take something like an avi receiver sure we could test the audio quality all"
13728640,13732400," day and we could validate that it works with all these different formats"
13732400,13735840," there's going to be edge cases there's going to be bugs and there's going to be"
13735840,13738240," things that you simply can't quantify like"
13738240,13742080," the interface of pretty much every avi receiver that i've ever encountered"
13742080,13746080," is needlessly obtuse i don't think we're going to be able to fix that"
13746080,13752080," um ever so that's the goal but it's one of those like"
13752080,13754960," well understandable limitations yeah that's noble but"
13754960,13757440," good luck right but we're going to do our best"
13757440,13760960," i want to ask you something about that sure we've talked about this a little bit"
13760960,13764400," uh oh but what are your current opinions on this"
13764400,13769760," talking about ai stuff yeah a huge problem in the ai world is the like"
13769760,13773360," ouroboros effect of it destroying all of its"
13773360,13779200," data creation yeah um impact on the lab yeah we are"
13779200,13786400," basically it i will say right now that this is already making me rethink our"
13786400,13788720," um"
13788720,13795600," our previously leaned towards strategy of making all the data just"
13795600,13801120," available with no account no subscription just on the page"
13801120,13805600," because if the entire site can simply be scraped and summarized"
13805600,13808720," there will be no reason to come to our website"
13808720,13811600," that doesn't mean that all of a sudden we're going to make the website"
13811600,13815920," experience awful by you know say covering it with intrusive"
13815920,13818240," advertising or anything like that that's not our goal"
13818240,13820960," wouldn't solve the problem either but but we also"
13820960,13827840," simply cannot just be a data mine for chat gpt or being gpt or whatever you"
13827840,13833840," want to call it um so i think that what you might"
13833840,13837040," end up with is you might end up with a site that is"
13837040,13842000," designed more around the output at least in terms of what's publicly"
13842000,13846480," available so you might enter you might say"
13846480,13850640," heck you could even we could even use a large language model interface"
13850640,13853520," can you recommend the best power supply for me for"
13853520,13857200," thirty to forty five dollars here are my considerations"
13857200,13860960," so we present so we presented as our own"
13860960,13864160," that's an interesting angle so there's there's"
13864160,13866960," it's something i'm giving thought to it's something that there are ways for us"
13866960,13870080," to work around um for example i mean one of the"
13870080,13874080," features that we've talked about that i'm really excited for the the gaming"
13874080,13877760," experience um comparison videos where it will take"
13877760,13880800," our archive of videos and it will compile them together for you to"
13880800,13885600," consume that is not easily passable not easily"
13885600,13888720," especially if it's uh if it's credential locked"
13888720,13895120," um and it's also pretty difficult or there's not"
13895120,13898880," there's not a value to consuming it through the ai"
13898880,13904640," if the value is in the seeing the smoothness of the gaming experience"
13904640,13907040," and seeing with your own eyes the comparison you're going to have to look"
13907040,13911440," at the comparison anyway you might as well look at the origin tool"
13911440,13914800," so there's ideas um"
13914800,13920480," i uh i don't know though i don't know because"
13920480,13925680," the the reality of it is i want this data"
13925680,13930400," i want this data to benefit consumers of"
13930400,13936800," electronics whatever i have to do to do that i'm going to do"
13936800,13943440," and if for this data source to survive i have to restrict access to it"
13943440,13947360," then i will do that because it has to exist so you're you're more interested"
13947360,13953760," in providing the resulting decision helpful information yes"
13953760,13958640," than just providing a database yes i don't care how we do it"
13958640,13962240," if it's a if it's a web extent or if it's a browser extension like we talked"
13962240,13965360," about earlier in the show and then anytime you're looking at a power"
13965360,13969440," supply that's like a crap deal it just recommends you something better"
13969440,13973680," and the other this is bad basically yeah and then we we recommend something"
13973680,13976720," else and we take an affiliate cut that's fine"
13976720,13981360," that's a way for us to get that that's a way that's not easily replicated by"
13981360,13984480," chat gpt because it's parsing our database on the back end that's"
13984480,13987040," private which they don't have any access to it does the grounding and silo"
13987040,13990720," problem naturally and you know what google might"
13990720,13995920," build an ai that monitors what products you look at in your browser"
13995920,13998640," theoretically they wouldn't because privacy or something but"
13998640,14001680," they might monitor what you look at in your browser and figure out what you"
14001680,14005040," ultimately purchase and that might guide it but it's going to be going off of"
14005040,14009360," secondary data we're always going to be out ahead of it"
14009360,14014000," interesting so it'll lag behind so if a price changes"
14014000,14020160," it'll keep recommending crap when ours will always be the most up-to-date"
14020480,14024640," interesting so there's ways there's ways we've got ideas"
14024640,14027920," we're not going to take this lying down that's the bottom line yeah"
14027920,14030960," because we're still doing the lab it's just yeah"
14030960,14036400," just like with every other realm right now yeah the path forward is"
14036400,14040800," unclear because of the impact of these types of systems path's always unclear"
14040800,14044160," a lot of people it's it's just i think like even more muddy now is all i'm"
14044160,14047520," saying that's always i agree i'm i'm just used to it at this"
14047520,14052080," point so this doesn't even really phase me like do you remember how i freaked"
14052080,14055840," out when vessel went under yeah i'm sitting here"
14055840,14060000," existential crisis do you remember how i freaked out when youtube revised their"
14060000,14065120," in-video sponsorship policies existential crisis amazon remember how freaked out"
14065120,14069280," when when the president of ncix decided maybe he wouldn't"
14069280,14072320," sell the channel to us existential crisis my entire"
14072320,14076560," f*cking last ten years of my life has been one existential crisis after"
14076560,14079600," another you know what i'm still here are time"
14079600,14084160," we're all we all are that's why it's yeah so on the one hand you know maybe it"
14084160,14088800," maybe it could turn into hubris maybe it could morph into arrogance"
14088800,14092480," but i think i'm realistic enough that i'm not going to allow that to happen"
14092480,14096480," and instead what it's got to turn into is"
14096480,14102480," being calm collected understanding that there is a way"
14102480,14106800," there's always a way like i think it's left what movie or tv"
14106800,14111440," show is it fry and suit in future drama okay they're they're stuck in like a"
14111440,14115600," video game or something like that and he's like no they always build in ways to"
14115600,14120480," beat these games well that's life so figure it out beat the"
14120480,14123520," game right like and we've got a world-class team i've"
14123520,14128400," said it a thousand times we're gonna do it so let's do it"
14129440,14133760," cool hell yeah all right on that same sort of vein"
14133760,14137520," do any of your early experiences sorry i'm gonna i'm gonna interject i hope"
14137520,14140720," other dan not this dan but i hope other days"
14140720,14143840," right hold on hold on we do need to come back to this for a second"
14143840,14147920," he says you're thinking melange so that would be a mix"
14147920,14152800," menage is a household household of three okay so it's actually more describing"
14152800,14158160," like a throuple than a sexual act um so he says biggie would be saying"
14158160,14161360," the household and you"
14161360,14167600," whatever yeah that kind of makes sense no it's a household"
14167600,14173040," of three not yeah so it's it's not it's definitely he's not right"
14173040,14178400," uh but uh i had the meaning of men i thought it was a mix of three"
14178400,14182560," but it's actually household of three okay we can carry on sounds good"
14182560,14187040," okay do any of your early experiences is at ncix inform your sourcing"
14187040,14190720," strategies are there any lessons learned that you carry forward with creator"
14190720,14195680," warehouse and all of the fabulous merch i mean ncix didn't build it so well"
14195680,14198560," actually it had some of its own products they sucked i learned a lot from that"
14198560,14203200," i learned a lot of what not to do from ncix um i learned a lot of what to do but"
14203200,14206960," i'm actually not involved in a lot of the day-to-day sourcing and ordering and"
14206960,14211520," like determining quantities negotiating pricing i do almost none of it i i advise"
14211520,14215680," but um the team over there handles the vast majority of that"
14215680,14220480," the the biggest thing that i learned at ncix and mostly from shopping there not"
14220480,14224640," as much from working there is that it's all about trust"
14224640,14230720," at the end of the day it's all about trust you can market all day by google ads"
14230720,14235760," you can hire a team of salespeople to push your product blah blah blah blah"
14235760,14239920," blah blah but if you want to build a sustainable business you just have to"
14239920,14244160," make a good product stand behind it and people will come and with the way that"
14244160,14250960," ltt store is growing q1 we're almost uh double year over year over last"
14250960,14254720," q1 like last year's q1 that's not an accident that's not because we're"
14254720,14257840," suddenly spending a million dollars a month on advertising or whatever"
14257840,14260240," that's because we make a good product and people keep coming back for it i mean"
14260240,14264000," you guys know look at this right i don't i don't make the rules that's just how"
14264000,14266400," it works"
14266400,14272400," okay next up first time sending a merch message"
14272400,14278000," what was the most surprising feature you've ever seen on a new graphics card"
14278000,14280480," game stream"
14280480,14285520," by the time frame generation landed i was like"
14285520,14289120," yeah we were headed this way whereas like game stream blew my mind"
14289120,14292800," i just didn't think of using harbor video and coding decoding like that that was"
14292800,14296880," really crazy i mean oh man i had i had in the dock today i wanted to talk about"
14296880,14301120," using the rog ally for game stream it's not technically game stream i guess"
14301120,14305600," because that's in videos trademark and i'm running an AMD graphics card but"
14305600,14310640," you tried it i was playing doom and turtle at ultra details"
14310640,14317040," 1080p on a handheld 120 frames per second this is 120 hertz display i was"
14317040,14322640," gonna say you were capped too weren't you nearly silent okay"
14322640,14327280," barely perceptible latency this is not something i expected to see in my"
14327280,14332000," lifetime yeah right i mean if you asked me a year ago yeah obviously"
14332000,14336000," before the before the tech existed yeah something you expected no it looked"
14336000,14339920," it looked incredible yeah felt great"
14339920,14344080," and it it brought me back into gaming too when i had my Nvidia shield and i had my"
14344080,14347360," son and i couldn't set up my computer anymore because i was busy holding a"
14347360,14354160," baby all the time just call a key right so yeah blew my mind how about you"
14354160,14358640," a graphics card i know this is probably gonna be annoying but probably the"
14358640,14361680," same thing i tried to think uh like it's gotta be like that"
14361680,14366320," physics but i was like no i mean it's too bad it didn't turn out but it could"
14366320,14371360," have been right but we saw it coming because what was the exact question it"
14371360,14375760," was something like most surprising what was that game though"
14375760,14378880," that one game we can rip the banners and stuff yeah"
14378880,14383280," agia promoted and it was like like physical interactions with the"
14383280,14388400," environment we're gonna be this car that blew me away okay it blew but it"
14388400,14392160," wasn't a graphics card feature yet well yeah it was that"
14392160,14397360," dedicated card and even assuming it was because you're right but even assuming"
14397360,14401840," it was i think you could say that wasn't super maybe it was surprising when it"
14401840,14405920," happened i didn't expect it to happen yet but like we all knew"
14405920,14409520," games are going in a direction of this type of stuff happening eventually"
14409520,14413200," so like what was the thing that like i'm interpreting surprise is like caught"
14413200,14416880," me off guard surprised me that it was happening at all i mean"
14416880,14419600," maybe you just weren't thinking about this kind of thing yet but you could"
14419600,14423040," look at something like kuda as a big surprise i definitely wasn't thinking"
14423040,14426160," about that yeah uh i mean the idea that you could"
14426160,14428960," like encode video oh super sick now yeah i just didn't"
14428960,14431920," really care much yeah i was trying yeah oh"
14431920,14436800," sli not surprising oh okay well we can move on yeah"
14436800,14440640," has lienus ever been to a michelan star restaurant if so where"
14440640,14444400," and he's can't wait for his ltd bottle if so i can't remember"
14444400,14448160," it's not the kind of thing that i would pay attention to because"
14448160,14452720," things that are cool because someone said they're cool is not interesting to"
14452720,14457040," me yeah what where were we in japan i don't know"
14457040,14460080," yeah i don't know where that was they probably deserved a michelan star i guess"
14460080,14463280," that place was amazing yeah everywhere it was great"
14463280,14466640," everything that i wanted to eat was delicious and then there was lots of"
14466640,14469040," stuff that i was super not down with like the"
14469040,14472800," chicken sashimi and all that yeah yeah we tried we both tried it"
14472800,14476000," it wasn't worth it don't do it and then i probably offended everyone there"
14476000,14479280," by boiling it and i was like wow good idea and i"
14479280,14483920," cooked the rest of my chicken too we just like cooked it in our boiling suit"
14483920,14489680," yeah we're basically monsters horrible yeah"
14489680,14494720," all right i recently picked up the pajama pants and absolutely love them so far"
14494720,14498000," nice out of curiosity what's the rationale behind using a mesh"
14498000,14501840," material for the pockets instead of the same as the rest of them i'm so glad you"
14501840,14506640," asked we agonize over every stupid little detail and then we"
14506640,14512480," never talk about it the reason is that the self-material that's what the main"
14512480,14517360," material is called self-seal of f the self-material is too stretchy"
14517360,14520240," and so when you would put something heavy like a phone"
14520240,14523840," in the pocket with the self-material and then walk it would like"
14523840,14528160," be all over the place so we went with the mesh because it's got a little bit"
14528160,14534080," more structure and it makes it kind of hold stuff a bit better"
14534080,14538400," okay next up hi Dan Lucan Linus what is something you do when you're"
14538400,14543440," physically exhausted and emotionally or mentally fatigued in order to recover"
14543440,14547360," I sleep I find those things to be extremely different scenarios"
14547360,14551280," personally I feel very differently when I'm"
14551280,14554240," mentally or physically exhausted yeah i'm not a percent"
14554240,14556800," oh sure well physically i have a bath"
14556800,14562880," soaked the muscles and then mentally I sleep or you know what i watch reruns"
14562880,14567360," like adventure time reruns just to completely turn off my brain"
14567360,14569760," how about you"
14569760,14575600," um if I mentally exhausted usually what I like to do is i get our channels"
14575600,14579600," deleted and i take it on yeah i keep powering through hell yeah"
14579600,14582720," um actually that kind of stuff is energy returning for me"
14582720,14586960," um a mission yeah if if there's none of"
14586960,14590080," nothing like that currently available kind of a missionary you know"
14590080,14592320," wow"
14592320,14596240," yeah there you go if there's nothing like that currently available i always"
14596240,14599440," find go-tos for me if i just need to like chill my brain out and"
14599440,14603200," relax which usually isn't because of exhaustion"
14603200,14608960," it's usually because of um i'm currently feeling like very angry or very sad"
14608960,14612160," i would say i'll usually dive into either"
14612160,14616320," assassins creed or civilization and just place and go player"
14616320,14619840," and just cruise around have no direct mission just let my mind kind of wander"
14619840,14621600," and sit there you really would enjoy breath of the"
14621600,14624800," wild you really do need to play it yeah i should probably start it again at"
14624800,14629280," some point um if i'm physically exhausted"
14629280,14635520," sleep yeah really is what you should do yeah stay hydrated yeah yeah"
14635520,14638640," paltitstore.com"
14638640,14642880," next steps from mitchell i've heard lioness comment on walkable cities in"
14642880,14646960," north america not being possible without bulldozing over current places"
14646960,14650240," could you possibly go into more detail about that topic"
14650240,14654000," um yeah i've actually had a peep a lot of people"
14654000,14657280," criticize that take in fact there was a whole video dedicated to addressing"
14657280,14660160," it which unfortunately i haven't had a chance to watch yet so i am not going"
14660160,14664800," to respond to it but what i will say is that a lot of"
14664800,14668560," my stance was not that it should be impossible"
14668560,14672720," but rather that with the mentality that a lot of people here in north america"
14672720,14677840," have i don't think it will ever happen um it is"
14677840,14683600," possible to turn previously car-centric cities into more walkable"
14683600,14688960," cities like a really long time but it only works for"
14688960,14694720," certain parts without an enormous investment in infrastructure"
14694720,14699760," that if i'm being honest i just don't see ever coming back to north america"
14699760,14703440," like whether we're talking about the u_s or canada and i don't know enough about"
14703440,14708640," mexico so my apologies but at least america and its hat"
14708640,14712160," um you look at the kind of infrastructure projects"
14712160,14715680," that not just happened but were commonplace"
14715680,14720880," in the 60s 70s and 80s we ain't doing that stuff anymore"
14720880,14725040," it's not happening what rapid transit"
14725040,14729680," who's gonna who's building it and yeah there's some stuff going on in vancouver"
14729680,14734400," right now but you look at how long it's taken to get to the state that it's at"
14734400,14737680," pretty sure we've been talking about that like literally my whole life the"
14737680,14742560," ex-polein was built in 1986 i know that because it was built"
14742560,14748480," for the 1986 world fair or expo expo fair yeah and that's the year that i was"
14748480,14752400," born yeah and it's gone from ex-polein to"
14752400,14756240," ex-polein and millennium line which you can probably guess when that was built"
14756240,14760640," that took 14 years and managed to cover with actual"
14760640,14767680," proper trains like what three percent of the greater vancouver area"
14767680,14771120," like if let's let's say let's say six percent"
14771120,14776800," and assuming you can walk like 20 minutes okay around any one of those stations"
14776800,14782560," then we got what that one other line and now they're finally adding another one"
14782560,14787520," commuting from where to where like the actual percentage of people that it"
14787520,14792400," addresses is pretty low with that said everyone who's not driving a car helps"
14792400,14795760," reduce congestion for all the other people who need to drive cars"
14795760,14798960," but that doesn't change that the way that this region is laid out"
14798960,14802160," and the way that they continue to develop our rapid transit"
14802160,14807840," is never going to change many people's reliance on cars"
14807840,14812720," so if that's the case"
14812720,14816640," i just don't see that i don't see the path forward and it's not because there's"
14816640,14821200," a technical reason it's because there's a people reason"
14821200,14826000," that's what i had sort of meant to say last time and i don't really think i got"
14826000,14829120," across very well so i'm i'm just i'm being kind of"
14829120,14832640," defeatist about it and that sucks and i shouldn't but i just"
14832640,14834320," sort of give up"
14834320,14839040," um yeah hey cool zakriev glad to hear it"
14839040,14842480," we apparently delighted a customer i don't want to know what the uh"
14842480,14845920," care team did i won't ask"
14845920,14850000," fun they went above and beyond did they go below and beyond or"
14850000,14855760," maybe i don't know maybe went you after dark everybody can't control any of that"
14855760,14858640," speaking of uh below second undi purchase here"
14858640,14861440," uh need some for wifey"
14861440,14865840," luke linus and dan what is your uh eso biggest tech"
14865840,14871360," faux pas or taboo mine is my wife neglecting to change regularly and"
14871360,14874400," repeatedly asking for passwords"
14874400,14878640," charge regularly but yes good try oh sorry um you know what yvonne's"
14878640,14882960," actually pretty good she she's one of those remarkable people that can take a"
14882960,14885920," genuine interest in other people"
14885920,14890000," like it's not like oh yeah tell me about work uh what tech thing are you working"
14890000,14892400," on right now and it's like in one ear and out the other she actually has"
14892400,14895200," absorbed a shocking amount"
14895200,14900720," um she cannot for the life of her handle a"
14900720,14904880," receiver based av system though as soon as you throw more than one"
14904880,14908400," remote in her she's like this is too much work i will watch on my phone"
14908400,14913520," oh no she also is allergic to port a two landscape mode"
14913520,14918000," she will actually watch movies in a little window like this oh"
14918000,14923040," rather than turn her phone and she's better about it now but for the longest"
14923040,14926960," time i'd be like i'd walk up to her sitting on the couch"
14926960,14931520," watching a movie like like like a movie like i'm not talking some three-minute"
14931520,14935840," youtube video or something a movie i would grab her phone enable"
14935840,14940160," auto rotate turn it and put it back in her hands and walk away"
14940160,14944400," i just i can't i can't handle that"
14944400,14951680," yeah i my passwords passwords passwords a legitimately significant portion of my"
14951680,14957120," literal job she won't use a password manager she insists on just memorizing"
14957120,14960000," everything but then she doesn't have to retype something in"
14960000,14963440," for a really extended period of time and forgets it of course and then ask to"
14963440,14966960," switch devices and she's like well i literally can't use this"
14966960,14970480," because i don't know the passwords for my logins and i'm like"
14970480,14975200," interesting that we have this problem but then she figures it out"
14975200,14978080," because you can like do account recovery and whatever else"
14978080,14981440," yeah but that's it's not the right way to do that"
14981440,14986800," and then she gets a win on me because last pass has this big breach right"
14986800,14990240," yeah and we're using last pass so she's going like nice honey pot bro"
14990240,14993920," huh there yeah all of your passwords are now"
14993920,14998160," in question you might call it a honey pot because it's your honey that's pretty"
14998160,15000400," good yeah so then we have to go through this i"
15000400,15003200," hadn't said it first before getting the the right"
15003200,15007360," dad joke i'm not even pushing them then"
15007360,15011680," and then we have this huge very laborist transition to a new"
15011680,15015440," uh password manager and she's still pointing her finger going like look at"
15015440,15019120," that and i'm like okay yeah fair but it's still not"
15019120,15023280," right you should still use one and she's like nope"
15023280,15028560," okay she's still wrong yeah i can tell her for you too if you want"
15028560,15032640," yeah so feel probably catch this yeah okay cool"
15032640,15035040," hi wife"
15035040,15039120," the birds find it very calming to just like hear me talking for long periods"
15039120,15045200," right so we'll just like run wancho when we're not at home"
15045200,15051600," if you if you come over they will probably recognize you that's very funny i"
15051600,15054880," didn't think about that until now"
15054880,15060240," oh it's it's wancho line it's now it's time for sleep"
15060240,15063520," that's pretty funny okay let's do uh let's do another one i knew another"
15063520,15066160," all right uh since you're discussing since you're"
15066160,15070880," discussing the ltt screwdriver did you see electro boom gave his away in"
15070880,15075040," kuba in his recent video i didn't see that but he told me in person"
15075040,15079600," we have a collab with meady coming very soon that i'm really excited about"

15097040,15100640," top and the the staticky thing that's not a jacob's lab"
15100640,15105600," as a well vanda graph generator oh yeah right yeah he he brought one of those"
15105600,15110800," he brought this terrifying thinking red alert to this terrifying esd wand"
15110800,15115440," um and and we we do some well we you know we do what he does best we"

15201520,15206720," hey dl i've met data analyst out of curiosity does lmg use any sort of"
15206720,15210080," data visualization software power buy to blow"
15210080,15216400," our this would be especially interesting with labs coming"
15216400,15219440," uh this is something we've explored in the past"
15219440,15223200," with labs it's it's uh more likely i don't know if they're using any of it"
15223200,15230080," right now um but no at least uh i mean maybe"
15230080,15234720," the labs is but outside of that no okay i'm not sure if it lives hey"
15234720,15238160," luke and lynus love the show question about ltx office"
15238160,15242000," slash labs visits will there be a place where people can wait in between the"
15242000,15246240," two different tours availability made mine one hour apart"
15246240,15251600," um i mean it's free country you could sit on the side of the road go for"

15275760,15280960," take feedback apologize don't just apologize do better next time"
15280960,15286800," and rinse and repeat don't get decision paralysis yeah do something even if"
15286800,15289200," you make mistakes you have to move forward yeah"
15289200,15292800," yeah like man that's i used to say that all the time"
15292800,15296240," it's like what what what did i used to say do you say it last time i don't know"
15296240,15299680," ah man i i think it was like if you leave me there i might find it but"
15299680,15305440," like 80 execution of a 20 plan is better than 20 execution of an 80 plan and it"
15305440,15308320," was kind of like this weird riff on the 80/20 rule"
15308320,15312080," or was it like a hundred percent execution of like a 10 percent plan"
15312080,15315120," yeah i don't i don't remember the percentage breaks i think it very long"
15315120,15319280," you got to do stuff but like this guy would sit around and plan"
15319280,15325680," things i'd be like that's nice but we can't we can't sell a"
15325680,15328880," plan and you know what there have been times then we should have done more"
15328880,15333920," planning however if you can only do one"
15333920,15339920," yeah i go with um one plus had a had a way better more succinct version of that"
15339920,15343200," uh hanging in their in their headquarters or their manufacturing or whatever it"
15343200,15348000," was when i was there and it was shipped is better than perfect"
15348000,15351920," it's like yeah you could spend all day polishing it there's there's startup"
15351920,15355600," companies that die because of that they just they just keep planning"
15355600,15358640," yeah and planning and planning and and sometimes the plan has to change you"
15358640,15362960," got to pivot so they just keep planning plan then pivot then plan then pivot"
15362960,15366240," then plan then ship something ship something"
15366240,15369440," that's you just got to ship something iterate don't"
15369440,15373360," okay someone uh a comment don't sleep on data analytics the lab is probably"
15373360,15377520," gonna blah blah blah we're not we're in a situation right now"
15377520,15380480," where we've we've mentioned a bunch of times during this show that we do"
15380480,15386800," so many different varied difficult things yeah all of those things"
15386800,15393120," like demand team expansion and you got to pick your battles sometimes"
15393120,15397840," like there there is an insane range and amount"
15397840,15401840," of different people with different specializations that we could bring on"
15401840,15405760," that could improve the things that we do if we attempted to do all that"
15405760,15411440," once we would just die immediately like it's"
15411440,15415600," yeah we're not sleeping on it we'll do stuff just"
15415600,15419280," you have to do stuff at reasonable times with reasonable team expansion and all"
15419280,15422000," these other types of things there's a lot that goes into it we're not"
15422000,15427200," just like ignoring stuff yeah that's all next up"
15427200,15432640," hello Linus, Luke and Dan. Linus in some streams you've partakened in some floor"
15432640,15435760," time do you ever end up just working from the floor"
15435760,15439920," meetings calls etc i'm really hoping this isn't just me"
15439920,15446000," i saw you on the stairs the other day uh i don't know what was going on with that"
15446000,15452000," meetings sometimes i just i need to i need some sensory deprivation so that i"
15452000,15457600," can think um shut certain systems down yeah just close my eyes"
15457600,15464800," lie down think um not calls i'm almost never on a call"
15464800,15470080," that like requires. I pace on calls yeah yeah i'm into the pacing"
15470080,15476720," um yeah nothing else to really add yeah floor time is real though"
15476720,15480480," they take pictures of me because they think it's funny i don't pose for"
15480480,15484720," floor time pictures because i think it's funny"
15485040,15489600," right next up hey LTT one day i'd be super curious to see Luke's reaction to"
15489600,15494480," the recent Adam Conover AI video he asserts that AI is basically scam"
15494480,15500240," technology all hype and fraud a la tesla's self-driving cars"
15500240,15504400," i mean i think it's pretty provable that's that's not true in like a lot of ways"
15504400,15508720," um yeah that's like a really bad take yeah i haven't washed it but i don't know i"
15508720,15512000," had a buddy working on a school assignment recently"
15512000,15515280," um and he was like complaining about how the"
15515280,15519040," school assignment was like hard or vague or whatever"
15519040,15523280," and i was like have you asked tach EPT?"
15523280,15529680," he's like oh no i was like okay well give me the question"
15529680,15534400," and he added to me i plugged it into chat gpt it"
15534400,15538640," pushed out like this insanely long very detailed response i gave that to him"
15538640,15542080," and he's like yeah i have to like fit it into a table this is like kind of too"
15542080,15544960," long so i guess it didn't really work i was like well that's not true"
15544960,15549040," like over to chat gpt can you make this shorter i don't remember how short it"
15549040,15552320," needed to be and it just went blip made it way shorter i handed back to him"
15552320,15556240," and he's like yeah okay that's pretty good"
15556240,15562080," this is a university course does let me chat gpt that for you already exist"
15562080,15564640," i think we yeah i think we forget this one okay yeah"
15564640,15569280," like it's yeah it's just a bad or uninformed take i don't know"
15569280,15576640," that is very strange um hold on is there the the when"
15576640,15580320," tuk beanie did we ever release that i don't"
15580320,15584000," apparently i was modeling it in my waffle long sleeve photos"
15584000,15588960," and someone's like hey where is that and i don't see it on the site"
15588960,15591680," uh okay remember that being a thing i don't know um"
15591680,15595600," dan do you mind firing a quick message over to nik to ask where that is if that"
15595600,15599200," like interests okay any who uh thanks brady"
15599200,15602800," good good call maybe we have like a warehouse full of when"
15602800,15606880," beanies that we haven't sold because it's not available on the site i don't know"
15606880,15610560," very strange i think i think just to jump on the adam con everything i haven't"
15610560,15614960," watched the video but if he says it's a scam thing because of how it"
15614960,15619280," uses other people's data to create its product without compensating them or"
15619280,15621680," anything like that sure if someone's getting scammed that's fair"
15621680,15627040," that's yeah but if it's like it's a ineffective technology that's just like"
15627040,15633360," extremely probably not true um there there are ai lawyers that have"
15633360,15636800," one case is already like what are you talking about"

15650160,15656480," nerd products while create a warehouse becomes its own brand"
15656480,15660080," we don't know the answer to that creator warehouse's future is supposed to be"
15660080,15664480," product development and fulfillment for a variety"
15664480,15669120," of entities whether they're creators or other brands or whatever else i think"

15673040,15676800," the the naz company i'm invested in potentially working on doing something"
15676800,15680080," collaboratively with knock to which would be super cool"
15680080,15684080," so there's no reason creator warehouse couldn't work with partners"
15684080,15687840," um and they would obviously want to have their own branding on their own"
15687840,15693520," products right but for lttstore.com i think ltt is our is our brand for"
15693520,15698400," better or for worse i don't know maybe we'd change it at some point but it"
15698400,15701360," wouldn't be creator warehouse it wouldn't change to creator warehouse it would"
15701360,15706080," be like that's that's the name of our company that works in the background on"
15706080,15711120," stuff it's not like a public public branding"
15711120,15715840," yeah ltt i don't know something we might do labs branded stuff i"
15715840,15719280," i don't know it's a good question ltt is just"
15719280,15723600," ltt as far as the store is confirmed since erin is just a logo it's got a lot"
15723600,15728000," of momentum yeah that too it's also like the logos are"
15728000,15732240," really small these days like the logo on the on the the windbreaker jacket"
15732240,15736240," is like i can even find it at first like they're not they're not heavily"
15736240,15740240," branded so when it when it gets to that it's like"
15740240,15745520," on your pocket or something yeah yeah there but it's like really small"

15926880,15930640," anything like that if they were young and they didn't understand it and they're"
15930640,15934720," working in the legal system career change they should probably retire"
15934720,15939040," um let me get that answer for you on which is the most popular bit pack"
15939040,15942320," now this is going to be a little bit skewed because some of them have been"
15942320,15948960," sold out for some time because um life is hard"
15948960,15957040," i just don't know what to tell you um man there's no last 365 days"
15957040,15962480," of i don't know 2022 uh when it when you launch the screwdriver you know what"

15972320,15974880," nobody's perfect i think they're a very good"
15974880,15977760," partner to be honest yes they've been very good to work with"
15977760,15981200," yes there's some things that like them announcing something and then it coming"
15981200,15985440," out like two years later can be kind of annoying but"
15985440,15990800," uh we've had the same problems so well at least wancho gets a dark mode"
15990800,16000000," uh okay that's really you uh of course then metric hex then the specialty"
16000000,16005200," bits followed by imperial hex followed by people loading up on standard and"
16005200,16008640," phillips we never said that was coming well we"
16008640,16012000," said it was coming but not soon that's all we've ever said it's still not soon"

16015120,16019600," um oh well oh yeah yeah here's here's some more"
16019600,16025120," ugh now i have to remember the variance and how many they sold okay"
16025120,16028720," okay no this is a duplicate list okay i don't even know what i'm looking at"
16028720,16032800," just got but dand yeah it doesn't matter the point is that's that's pretty much"
16032800,16038240," it cool um when do we get the luke talks ai"
16038240,16042080," hour maybe it's own show new channel"
16042080,16047600," i do you're not very busy right i do think it's been kind of surprising"
16047600,16054560," that our coverage of this has only really been a little bit on tech linked"
16054560,16059920," and then wancho when there's channels that i think would cover this type of"
16059920,16064080," stuff less often that have done sometimes multiple"
16064080,16067760," mainline videos about it that surprises me a little bit but like"
16067760,16073680," i don't know it also moves like so fast that unless someone's doing like a"
16073680,16076720," daily upload channel only dedicated to just that"
16076720,16079920," but if you if you really want to follow it you need to kind of follow it in"
16079920,16084960," other ways so i don't know i don't know"
16084960,16091200," yeah hello llnd can we get the story about the hard drives that got carried"
16091200,16095040," in a shopping cart through parking lot maybe even a technical explanation"
16095040,16099760," of the damage thanks oh that was like um that's not that's not our story that's"
16099760,16103120," uh i forget who it was but they were like migrating their data center"
16103120,16107360," and it wasn't on a shopping cart but it was on like an AV cart that had hard"
16107360,16111360," wheels and as they apparently after they rolled them across the parking lot"
16111360,16113920," because that's how they moved them because that's how far they were going"
16113920,16116320," they were like moving to that building over there"
16116320,16120240," uh the the failure rate was like astronomical or something like that"
16120240,16123920," and they determined that it was because they used hard wheeled carts rather than"
16123920,16127200," soft wheeled carts and that much vibration was very damaging to the"
16127200,16130400," extremely sensitive hard drives because they are"
16130400,16134640," phenomenally precision manufactured pieces of"
16134640,16137760," marvelous technology like hard drives yeah they're like old and crappy or"
16137760,16141680," whatever but they're still pretty cool"
16141680,16145360," lnl you have a ton of employees from many different backgrounds that work at"
16145360,16148000," lmg have you ever collected employee family or"
16148000,16151920," favorite recipes and turned it into an lmg company cookbook"
16151920,16156080," nope that has never happened how the devil did that get curated"
16156080,16162080," i thought it was funny hi luke lineus and dan um i'm recovering some all"
16162080,16166640," nighters spent at work uh-huh uh to make a deadline that was shifted last"
16166640,16172240," minute what's the most egregious deadline change you faced at work"
16172240,16178640," while we went from you have to"
16178640,16184880," keep our channel up forever which is fine because it is to you have to get it"
16184880,16190240," back up because it's gone um you know with the hack recently"
16190240,16193120," so there was no deadline and then suddenly we had one"
16193120,16197840," i don't know what's a deadline shift i mean i don't know we probably should have"
16197840,16201840," more strict deadlines we've had had that deadline for migrating to"
16201840,16208400," a keeper was it shifted i don't know if it was shifted it wasn't shifted yeah i"
16208400,16211040," don't know deadline shift a lot of deadline shifts"
16211040,16214880," don't happen a lot of deadlines that are like practically impossible have"
16214880,16217840," happened like remember when vessel went under and we had a week to build"
16217840,16220640," like a working minimum viable product of flowplane like that"
16220640,16224880," weekend yeah exactly but that was that's not a shifted deadline though"
16224880,16228480," that's a deadline that didn't exactly no i'm saying i was yeah i was agreeing"
16228480,16232160," with you yeah i don't think that i was agreeing with you yeah why do you keep"
16232160,16237760," no i'm just i don't yeah i don't think they shift too often"
16237760,16243120," they're just pretty hard to meet sometimes but like i don't know"
16243120,16248000," we're in a fast-moving workspace it's going to be like that"
16248000,16251440," not complaining about it just yeah but yeah i don't think they shift that"
16251440,16257440," often i think it's happened um like an example that i could"
16257440,16261120," give but i don't think this like matters and i think it was the right absolutely"
16261120,16264080," the right call um was related to the hack with the"
16264080,16266880," video the video is originally going to be like saturday's video and then we're"
16266880,16269760," like nope it's today's in the middle of writing it"
16269760,16272560," but like yeah that was the right call if we were going to get the channel back"
16272560,16276880," that absolutely should have been the first upload yeah had to be yeah so like"
16276880,16279280," i don't know couldn't just be some random video"
16279280,16282720," and then like three days later it's about we finally address it yeah like"
16282720,16285920," it should have been it should have been right then so"
16285920,16291760," usually with the deadline shifts it's like i am in full agreeance so i don't"
16291760,16296720," know is it possible that we get more accent colors for the screwdriver or"
16296720,16300400," do we have to go diy if we want to have one in the future"
16300400,16304640," hmm should i leak it"
16304640,16312000," how far out ltx then yeah it might be new if you come to ltx"
16312000,16320000," we are going to have um all six colors of the rainbow"
16320000,16325360," available in selector rings handles beauty rings and end caps"
16326240,16332320," you will be able in the screwdriver booth to build your own driver"
16332320,16336320," that's so cool i didn't know but this that is so sick how's well like how are"
16336320,16339360," you going to swap those things out you can't swap those things out in whatever"
16339360,16343440," color you like so you build it that's how you end up getting you get to"
16343440,16348080," press fit it together yourself so sick one of my favorite things about ltx"
16348080,16351920," has always been the hands-on booths because that's something that packs"
16351920,16355280," used to be totally all about and then it's super died and now packs is"
16355280,16358960," like kind of boring and that is so cool"
16358960,16362880," kyle is very upset sorry kyle why do you do this to me what do you mean"
16362880,16366320," please apologize to kyle sorry kyle see this is maybe one of those timelines"
16366320,16369840," that we were just talking about it hasn't shifted it's still ltx it might be"
16369840,16374640," really hard to get ready for it i don't know now he has to do it yeah"
16374640,16378240," now there is a deadline yeah it was already probably already a deadline"
16378240,16381760," yeah he's got this just really hard some of the colors are not like"
16381760,16386240," like matching each other perfectly because we're using like a red that mega"
16386240,16389920," pro already had on hand and we're using some other color that we were"
16389920,16392880," experimenting with for something else and we have some dye you know like it's"
16392880,16397920," not it's kind of a sh*t it's custom built but you"
16397920,16402960," put it together you will build it yourself so sick it will cost more"
16402960,16406880," i have to pay kyle and tyn and the rest of the team over there i don't know who"
16406880,16411280," is or isn't on probation but i have to pay them we have to do these like"
16411280,16416640," stupid super small runs of like these different colored plastics how many"
16416640,16421680," are you prepping i will say this the quality of the driver"
16421680,16426160," may not be 100 percent to the standard of what we would make a hundred thousand"
16426160,16431280," of or whatever because different colors can shrink ever so slightly differently"
16431280,16434080," probably it will be fine we'll be using the same plastics we'll be using"
16434080,16438720," same types of dyes it will probably be fine understand this is kind of a one"
16438720,16442240," off thing but understand this is a wacky thing that we're doing"
16442240,16444960," so that totally worth doing you can have super cool"
16444960,16450000," a personalized one-of-a-kind driver in the color of your choice"
16450000,16454160," um there's certain things that will be all the same color the bit holders inside"
16454160,16458720," i believe we're aiming for white we didn't want black because our bits are"
16458720,16462400," black in the contrast the low contrast would be really awful"
16462400,16469120," but um if we have a ton of leftovers it is possible"
16469120,16472960," that we will just mash them all together randomly"
16472960,16476000," and make like a mystery screwdriver and you can order a mystery screwdriver or"
16476000,16479520," something like that but if you want to hand pick"
16479520,16484080," the colors you will you must be at ltx cal saying it'll be fine we tested it"
16484080,16487280," it's okay well i mean okay one thing we haven't tested"
16487280,16491040," kyle i don't think is that normally when we assemble the drivers we assemble"
16491040,16495840," them warm so that they shrink um for the for the press"
16495840,16499760," fit these we obviously won't be doing that unless you guys are going to have"
16499760,16504640," them like preheated in like uh not hot but like warm oven or something so i"
16504640,16507120," don't know there's still some questions that we have to answer"
16507120,16510720," kyle if you're watching on flowplane if you watch on the beta site there's uh"
16510720,16514080," it's it's it's lower latency so you should do that so you can answer"
16514080,16519520," better just so you know made it off flowplane.com it's like way better"
16519520,16524000," height line is in luck will there be an autograph will there be an autograph"
16524000,16530560," signing session during ltx expo i hate calling it an autograph but"
16530560,16534560," i will sign anything you put in front of my face i think what they're asking about"
16534560,16537760," is like are you going to dedicate time to like stand in a spot behind a table"
16537760,16541360," and sign stuff oh i don't know i hadn't really"
16541360,16546960," occurred to me i want to participate yeah um how do i put this ltx is about me"
16546960,16552240," too i want to have fun i want to have fun i agree i want to do stuff i'm excited"
16552240,16555760," for whale land yeah right like well and last whale land was so"
16555760,16559600," sick and the fact that it's going like overnight again is so cool because so"
16559600,16562720," many of these different like like packs doesn't go overnight for their land"
16562720,16566560," right yeah it's just lame come on yeah"
16566560,16572240," yeah how do y'all feel about the availability of diy military tech thanks"
16572240,16576400," to chinese suppliers or 3d printers lmllms i don't know"
16576400,16579840," what that is what's an llm large language model"
16579840,16583040," oh yeah the thing we've been talking about all night"
16583040,16588160," i thought it was like a manufacturing thing context high refresh rate plus"
16588160,16593200," resolution thermal cameras banned by itar are cheap on aliexpress for example"
16593200,16598160," hmm i don't know dude yeah the future is like"
16598160,16603040," actually freaking terrifying yeah because like for a long time there was"
16603040,16606320," the whole we own the night thing with the american military"
16606320,16610160," and now you can buy thermal cameras on aliexpress"
16610160,16615680," and that's just yeah running out to the woods and hiding"
16615680,16620160," not being an applicable option is like not the most comfortable thing"
16620160,16624640," yeah stick it on your robot dog that you can buy off the"
16624640,16628160," that's stop talking uh great show as always any update on the acoustic"
16628160,16631360," panels line is talked about in a tour video a while back"
16631360,16636560," eh the acoustic panel uh yeah uh the update is that we're having a"
16636560,16641280," really hard time getting the the frames perfect"
16641280,16645840," um we set a goal for ourselves very early on that we wanted them to have an"
16645840,16649120," extremely high reground plastic content"
16649120,16651920," because we weren't that comfortable with just like"
16651920,16656960," manufacturing giant plastic things that are just going to end up in a landfill"
16656960,16662160," someday so we wanted to um have a high percentage of of regrind"
16662160,16667040," um that's been really hard so if we were if we had just said"
16667040,16672960," forget it we're just gonna either extrude or shoot"
16672960,16676640," all brand new plastic we could probably have released it already"
16676640,16679280," actually i shouldn't even say that because the covers have been a challenge"
16679280,16683200," to the fabric covers we want something that is"
16683200,16686640," man we have a lot of design goals for the covers we want them to be acoustically"
16686640,16690320," transparent we want them to be easily removable and washable"
16690320,16694560," we want them to be print-onable so that someday a thousand years in the future"
16694560,16698400," maybe you could have a custom graphic printed on it straight from ltt store"
16698400,16700960," um what else were we we want them to not be"
16700960,16705360," wrinkly um yeah there were just a lot of goals and"
16705360,16710000," it's kind of unreasonable and so we're gonna do our best"
16710480,16714480," um"
16714480,16721040," like is not on have you been able to give any advice to"
16721040,16725280," hacksmith james to manage burnout and the pressures of growing a youtube"
16725280,16728720," channel while supporting a growing staff and requiring more space and"
16728720,16731440," equipment i mean the thing with james is he's"
16731440,16736320," you know he's a big boy um and he's"
16736320,16739360," how to not but he's resilient right like he's"
16739360,16743520," he's doing what what works for him he was actually in a video recently"
16743520,16747920," um the the one on the the john wick bulletproof suit that did like 12"
16747920,16751200," million views so i was kind of looking at going like dang okay he's back he"
16751200,16754480," seems to be kind of hitting his stride in terms of the content a little bit"
16754480,16758160," um i'm pretty sure they they did like a pretty good"
16758160,16760960," sponsorship deal for that they had to like hacksmith"
16760960,16763920," let me tell you you want a sponsor hacksmith it ain't cheap they do a great"
16763920,16766640," job over there but you got to pay to play right"
16766640,16773520," um i mean we've talked but like i i wouldn't see my role"
16773520,16777600," in in that interaction as being"
16777600,16782480," like uh like like as a mentor or anything like that like we're we're mutually"
16782480,16786560," supportive i mean i've had my own challenges too right"
16786560,16791920," okay uh have you ever had a computer issue that annoyed you for months"
16791920,16798960," over years before you fixed it oh okay i have a issue on my work desktop"
16798960,16804160," right now that is ticking me off uh i can't use pin sign in or windows hello"
16804160,16807760," i have to type my password it's like bugged"
16807760,16812080," weird yeah it's like i think you showed me this you you click the thing and it"
16812080,16814560," just like doesn't yeah actually do anything okay"
16814560,16818160," and then oh right i had that issue that anthony made a video about when i was on"
16818160,16821760," vacation where um my machine would just like randomly"
16821760,16825200," reboot when it was idle and it turns out that it's like a thread repair power"
16825200,16828080," management bug that AMD just hasn't been ours to fix"
16828080,16833600," that i i had that for probably months um this pin one is relatively new but i"
16833600,16837280," will probably deal with it for months because the reality of it is that it"
16837280,16841680," takes me about four seconds to type in my password"
16841680,16847680," so i type in my password what maybe zero to five times a day"
16847680,16852320," so this costs me maybe like three minutes a month or you know whatever"
16852320,16857040," that works out to so if it takes me any longer than five minutes to resolve"
16857040,16861920," it's basically not worth it so it's like it's tough right i could ask"
16861920,16865680," someone else to do it i could get dand to do it but he has other things to do"
16865680,16869280," that are also more important so i i don't know i don't know if this counts but i"
16869280,16874080," have a lot of issues with a wide variance or different services logging me at"
16874080,16877680," oh it happened with you with the doc today"
16877680,16880320," just all these services logging me out all the time"
16880320,16883440," for no reason sometimes i have to log into the same thing"
16883440,16888400," uh our current password manager i know what it's set to"
16888400,16893120," i know it yeah sometimes i have to log into it like six times a day"
16893120,16899840," like this makes no sense yeah it's why i don't know it seems to be a"
16899840,16906160," universally like kind of not reliable thing i don't know"
16906160,16910800," hi dll any chance of an ltt store water-cooled chair i know it wouldn't be cheap"
16910800,16915120," but definitely worth it for us hot boys"
16915120,16921680," no we just we don't know enough about the product category we"
16921680,16927440," we don't um we don't have experience dealing with extremely large items"
16927440,16931120," uh that's a big one yeah getting an ergonomic"
16931120,16934960," product that affects has the potential to affect people's health"
16934960,16939840," right really challenging um do you think you would ever partner"
16939840,16944560," with another chair manufacturer why would they if they wanted to do the"
16944560,16947280," work what i'll need to do it just do it yeah like we didn't patent anything so"
16947280,16950480," like yeah i don't know what if they're just not capable"
16950480,16954480," yeah i mean that so if no one's doing it then what i'm assuming is that no one"
16954480,16958000," there's a reason is doing it yeah yeah"
16958000,16963840," i have run out of curated messages oh okay uh well then instead of replying"
16963840,16967120," to them in text um are you replying to text ones too"
16967120,16970560," Luke yeah okay nice we're just chipping away at this"
16970560,16974720," uh i don't know what it is but i think the after dark thing"
16974720,16978720," puts people in merch message mode even harder than we just cruising is that"
16978720,16981520," what's going on other things we do yeah because oh wow we're cruising"
16981520,16984880," there are we're definitely yeah i'm pretty sure the light is about both been"
16984880,16989360," trying to chew on the incoming because i'm glad i'm glad you guys understand"
16989360,16993120," what it's like now i did it before you did okay fine"
16993120,16997680," here's one uh uh i will continue to reply to merch messages and i will curate"
16997680,17001680," ones for Luke uh excellent and i will read them to Luke"
17001680,17004400," everybody has the problem with this is a ton of them are going to be like who"
17004400,17009600," learners um but we'll see hi lymason slick any thoughts on"
17009600,17012720," making content for float plane development hey i tried to answer this one"
17012720,17016080," at text yeah that happens to me with lynus sorry"
17016080,17019360," keep going keep going uh interested in behind the scenes content for day to day"
17019360,17023280," work and challenges faced being one of few companies to"
17023280,17028080," handle streaming uh we could do stuff"
17028080,17036640," um i don't think all that many people would actually find it all that"
17036640,17042880," interesting i i do think that um i don't want to have my devs who have"
17042880,17048960," insanely too much work to do um spending time working on writing a blog"
17048960,17053440," um i do think that it would be extremely inconsistent"
17053440,17057520," because we'd have like way too much stuff to talk about because you know we"
17057520,17060320," just launched the beta site and then we're gonna have like"
17060320,17065280," uh a huge pewling jane piling on no i have unlimited time"
17065280,17070080," you did but my one of my biggest problems is that you don't"
17070080,17075040," if you if you had unlimited time that would be amazing"
17075040,17080240," um i need to clone jaden like a bunch of times"
17080240,17085200," um yeah like there would be huge droughts where we're not going to have"
17085200,17088720," anything to talk to you about and then there's like oh we're like"
17088720,17091280," releasing a bunch of stuff all at once there's tons of things"
17091280,17095520," um but like the actual development of them is probably not going to be very"
17095520,17101600," interesting to you like isn't it um oh man"
17101600,17106560," michael reves really cool videos fantastic dude"
17106560,17110240," he constantly talks about like hey i engineered this thing here's all the"
17110240,17113840," really interesting like physical and mechanical stuff that i did"
17113840,17116960," that you're all going to want to see and here's the code and then he'll just"
17116960,17120640," scroll through all of it in like a one and a half second clip"
17120640,17123280," where it just like hyper scrolls down the whole thing and he's like cool"
17123280,17126880," because no one cares about that and it's like yeah some people in the"
17126880,17129840," this audience will because you're also developers whatever but like"
17129840,17133680," the vast majority of people won't so it's this cost benefit thing if like"
17133680,17137680," okay i have to take these developers that have a task list that's like"
17137680,17141360," genuinely multiple years long and before people yell at me"
17141360,17144960," know that is not how we handle our backlog relax there's just"
17144960,17148240," a lot of things that we could do and then we have our backlog it's the"
17148240,17151840," shorter amount before it it's okay just it's okay"
17151840,17156480," um but like yeah x amount of you will care a lot"
17156480,17159360," is it worth spending a bunch of time that we could spend developing doing that"
17159360,17162560," no i don't really think so also it's going to be really inconsistent"
17162560,17166000," um like someone asked internally recently like why don't we just have a"
17166000,17171280," channel um like under under like the we can make"
17171280,17174240," sub-channels now right so why don't we have a sub-channel that's full plane"
17174240,17177280," development it's like well okay so we're going to add shorts"
17177280,17179920," we're going to add all the social posts we're going to add this we're going to"
17179920,17183920," have game linked soon we're going to have the the labs video channels potentially"
17183920,17188480," we're going to have all this it's going to be 14 scrolls long worth of sub-channels"
17188480,17191280," that the line of sick tips channel has and on there there's going to be float"
17191280,17194480," plane development and we're going to upload to it like once in a blue moon"
17194480,17198320," i i don't know we talked about on a wanchow hopefully that's interesting"
17198320,17201840," i'm replying to messages right now but i'm not seeing any come up here"
17201840,17205760," is it possible it's bugged no let me check the queue"
17205760,17208480," um yeah five seconds and there'll be another one"
17208480,17211440," oh okay it spreads it out depending on how many there are in the queue"
17211440,17214000," oh hilarious you know the one right now oh"
17214000,17217200," someone also said how about we do blog posts and lose stand-ups like"
17217200,17220880," that's actually or jadon said that sorry and i don't mean to throw jadon under"
17220880,17224160," the bus that's actually just a really bad idea"
17224160,17229680," um my reasoning for that is is multi-fold one i don't necessarily want all of"
17229680,17233360," the developers just now suddenly doing public communication"
17233360,17239680," um also look at anything that shares its development path super"
17239680,17245840," transparently and it just immediately becomes a gigantic horrible nightmare"
17245840,17249440," always because the community is just going to be in a"
17249440,17256000," constant state of hysterical screaming for the now entire future of your"
17256000,17260640," company because no one will ever it doesn't matter how well you do it"
17260640,17263040," no one's ever going to agree about what you're working on"
17263040,17265920," how you're working on it all these different types of things"
17265920,17268320," blah blah blah and now a huge portion of your time"
17268320,17271680," is going to be filled up addressing community comments"
17271680,17277600," you know whatever blah blah blah blah and it's just like oh man i don't know"
17277600,17281760," it's uh it's not good if you want to peek into how it goes check out star"
17281760,17286240," citizen yeah oh good oh god okay i was kind of like"
17286240,17288960," i don't know if you can say any of this definitively"
17288960,17292800," until you said that yep all right you win"
17292800,17296640," um next up short circuit is partly responsible for the mechanical keyboard"
17296640,17303120," rabbit hole i went down this week what are all of your keyboard preferences"
17303120,17309600," i am a pleb and i'm actually really loving the logitech 915 TKL"
17309600,17313760," it's not it's a nice keyboard"
17313760,17318080," two out of two of mine have been defective in some way eventually"
17318080,17321760," one started double pressing in the other head like an RGB led die or"
17321760,17324720," something like that so i didn't even bother arming that one"
17324720,17331280," but like what i will say about it is i have grown very accustomed to low"
17331280,17334800," profile low profile is sick and it i'm really"
17334800,17338160," fast on it i wish it had a numpad maybe i should get the numpad"
17338160,17341360," version is their one i don't know but i yeah i i'm"
17341360,17345040," i like it i think i have the external numpad i had oh that's true i actually"
17345040,17347760," have one on my desk i just always forget to use it"
17347760,17352000," i think i have whatever is the like soft tactile like whatever like"
17352000,17355920," browns would be but in there whatever mechanical switches they're using on"
17355920,17361280," that i'm i'm definitely into the super super"
17361280,17366880," nerdy stuff that that pluft's got like anytime i'm at his desk i'm like"
17366880,17370160," like on his keyboard so here's another one so good what's what's the brand name of"
17370160,17372160," the keyboards the standard keyboards dance probably"
17372160,17374960," i know um i have one in front of me they are key"
17374960,17376640," cron key cron"
17376640,17386240," how expensive are these no let's not get into this again"
17386240,17389520," they're eight hundred dollars each"
17389520,17394480," i think they're a good deal though they're really nice yeah they're sick"
17394480,17397360," so what i was really going to say about it is like"
17397360,17400320," when i came into the office things i was worried about was peripherals"
17400320,17403520," because i have some pretty strong preferences about peripherals"
17403520,17406240," and then they were able to give me the same mouse i have at home"
17406240,17409040," i don't have my like power playpad but that's fine"
17409040,17411200," whatever i just plug it in when i leave we have this to"
17411200,17414640," that's easy i i do not need one i just i would rather"
17414640,17417600," just use the setup that i have i just plug it in when i leave it's completely"
17417600,17418400," fine"
17418400,17423120," um but i got i got the key cron keyboard and i was like this is pretty"
17423120,17425920," sick it's pretty nice it's a nice keyboard i'm not going to request a"
17425920,17428880," different one i'm just happy with what i got yeah we don't want we don't want"
17428880,17431680," us just like issue people crap right now for sure yeah"
17431680,17434960," i was just i was worried about how expensive it was but i didn't actually"
17434960,17438000," want to change it because it's really nice and like"
17438000,17441040," people here are going to be typing a lot like having a having a good solid"
17441040,17443200," keyboard genuinely even makes sense for just like"
17443200,17446400," ergonomic reasons um and even just having the"
17446400,17449200," pick of whatever keyboard that you want if you don't have to keep"
17449200,17452720," so cool and different mice and all that sort of stuff i think that's really"
17452720,17455440," important pretty sweet benefit yeah i'm not i'm not trying to crush on that i was"
17455440,17459760," just like hoping it wasn't super expensive um but yeah i i actually really"
17459760,17466480," like that keyboard i'm a fan um right now i use uh"
17466480,17469760," oh man what's the whole name"
17469760,17475440," sure sure sure bits i think they're not spelled the same as sure bay"
17475440,17477920," oh my goodness i'm not going to be able to remember"
17477920,17481360," the uh the name of it but i use some really weird key switches at home and i"
17481360,17484400," like them a lot but i also really like my keycronet work i'm very happy with"
17484400,17488880," both of them okay you've stated that you're really"
17488880,17492400," not into the idea of bridging multiple internet connections to boost speed with"
17492400,17496320," a person with gigabit plus internet would you say that the same thing for"
17496320,17501760," under five megabits per second connection no because that person as far as i could"
17501760,17505440," tell was trying to boost the speeds that they could"
17505440,17509520," individually access past the speed of one of those connections which is really"
17509520,17513840," complicated and involves like we did a video about this how to double your"
17513840,17516640," internet speed or whatever where we worked with i-tell"
17516640,17522400," to actually bond multiple internet connections and the problem is that they"
17522400,17526480," have to go through an aggregator that is a separate third"
17526480,17530000," essentially internet connection service that you have to pay for"
17530000,17534800," um that combines everything you can't just like use your router to do that"
17534800,17540080," so with that in mind that was not a real solution to that problem and that's"
17540080,17545520," not even a problem because gigabit we made the argument i think you were"
17545520,17548560," in agreement on that one and i don't remember i basically said no don't buy"
17548560,17552480," two one gigabit connected yeah that gigabit is enough for your internet"
17552480,17557600," because external services are more likely to be your bottleneck"
17557600,17561600," with five megabit all of a sudden it's a very different conversation"
17561600,17567040," um and in fact the badminton center that i built that uh video streaming"
17567040,17569920," setup for i did a video about it a while back"
17569920,17573680," i did advise them to get a second internet connection because they're"
17573680,17578800," limited by crappy adsl upload speeds and so we weren't able to stream from all"
17578800,17582320," of their courts concurrently but we were able to get around that"
17582320,17585440," by having two nicks on the back of the computer"
17585440,17589200," and then i have one of them going to one internet connection the other going to"
17589200,17594160," the other and then i have obs configured to send out three streams over one"
17594160,17597840," connection and two streams over the other connection so that we're able to"
17597840,17602480," actually utilize all of that bandwidth with a single client but you'll notice"
17602480,17609520," that that's not a single application that's dual network interfaces with"
17609520,17613680," five discrete applications that need network access"
17613680,17617040," so if you're trying to overcome some kind of bottleneck"
17617040,17622080," then yes it's a valid solution but it has to be a multi-user or at the very least"
17622080,17625520," multi-application over multi-interface"
17625520,17631360," um solution now you probably don't actually need two physical interfaces"
17631360,17635920," you could probably set it up with vlens or whatever else if you're very clever"
17635920,17638240," it was a lot faster for me to just do it this way"
17638240,17640480," so"
17640480,17645200," okay the last one i have here in the curated in the past you've encouraged"
17645200,17648160," the preservation of data on the internet with that in mind"
17648160,17652800," how do you feel with those that saved slash downloaded the private"
17652800,17657840," videos that were released by the hackers um data preservation"
17657840,17661680," okay so this is i feel like there's going to be someone out there who's"
17661680,17663280," going to"
17663280,17666240," you know in bad faith interest in here"
17666240,17670240," yeah in bad faith take my response and try to find the hypocrisy in it you"
17670240,17672400," know like i could"
17672400,17676640," the bottom line is um no i consider that my private data that was never intended"
17676640,17681120," to be published and um you pretty much right like"
17681120,17684400," and you could look at that answer and you could go well Linus you know you had a"
17684400,17687520," very different position when we were talking about"
17687520,17693200," um like leaks out of nintendo uh of something like the the super mario world"
17693200,17696320," assets i think is an excellent example like some of the some of the asset and"
17696320,17700560," source code leaks out of nintendo and my response to that is that nintendo is"
17700560,17704400," not an individual citizen for one thing and for another"
17704400,17709200," um that has historical significance you know footage that i never intended to"
17709200,17712640," release of me playing with my children does not have historical"
17712640,17715520," significance that's just an invasion of my privacy"
17715520,17718320," now you could turn around and you could say well anytime you upload something to"
17718320,17721440," the internet you pretty much relinquish uh your"
17721440,17724560," control over it and that's true to an extent"
17724560,17730160," but it's also um"
17730160,17734880," it's not cool it's not cool to kind of go"
17734880,17739440," ha ha ha because you do ha ha ha like it's"
17739440,17743040," i don't know yeah you're just like kind of a asshole like what else can i"
17743040,17746480," really say about it right like it's out there it's done now"
17746480,17751280," the milk is is spilled and i i'm not gonna strike and effect this right"
17751280,17755680," like i'm not gonna complain about it and imagine and try to get it taken down"
17755680,17759840," like it's not gonna happen right um but if you like"
17759840,17762960," think you're clever and you think you're cool or whatever you're not and you're"
17762960,17765200," not"
17765200,17770880," yeah i uh i strongly agree with that and i don't think we had actually talked"
17770880,17774880," about it and i was unsure if we were going to talk about it on"
17774880,17779040," the like hack whan show that was the day after or whatever"
17779040,17782720," um but it's it's kind of disgusting to me to be completely honest and i have"
17782720,17786480," i have archived things that have leaked before"
17786480,17791440," but it's different i've archived things that are like"
17791440,17796320," extremely unrelated to picture videos of someone playing with their children"
17796320,17802400," you know what i mean like i've archived some some scientific papers"
17802400,17807360," i've archived stuff like that yeah that's very different to me and i think"
17807360,17811920," painting all of it with a broad brush is ridiculous and"
17811920,17814320," um"
17814480,17819120," just kind of gross yeah well it's it's voyeurism"
17819120,17822400," it's straight up extremely icky yeah like that's that's"
17822400,17825680," very gross i mean while you're at it why don't you train a model with my face"
17825680,17831280," and watch a i generated porn like you can because it's"
17831280,17835440," disgusting and unacceptable"
17835440,17839280," anyways yep"
17839280,17842000," hey minus i read some threads sorry i don't go"
17842000,17846480," apart you were in the right but i i read some threads on it at the time where"
17846480,17851600," people were defending it and it made me uncomfortable and i just moved on"
17851600,17855840," because i don't like it but it is what it is it's out there"
17855840,17857920," all right"
17857920,17862480," uh hey liness whatever happened with the one dollar pc giveaway what was the"
17862480,17866400," craziest thing you have given away uh was that the stream won the random"
17866400,17869760," pc i think so yeah it gave it away and what's the"
17869760,17873280," craziest thing you've ever given away probably that"
17873280,17876960," i think i would agree that was nuts yeah well there was the rigate microcenter"
17876960,17879680," that wasn't technically given away but would she pay like 20 bucks or something"
17879680,17882880," like that or like ten dollars yeah i don't know"
17882880,17888800," that the computers usually have you guys considered open sourcing software"
17888800,17893200," ltt labs make so the community can help out free labor will help the labs"
17893200,17895760," money pit oh i tried to text response to this"
17895760,17898560," both of them are right at the same time yeah i think that's why it bugged which is"
17898560,17903040," why i curated it because i couldn't reply to it anymore"
17903040,17907680," if it makes sense we will absolutely consider it but we are not promising"
17907680,17910640," anything at this time"
17910640,17914960," uh there's a message asking about white or light gray"
17914960,17919120," mouse pads um no it's just it's not a good idea"
17919120,17921360," yep"
17922240,17928880," ooh yeah are we working at this time on watched or didn't watch status on"
17928880,17931440," floatplane"
17931440,17935680," where you're winking yes oh i'm cringing oh yeah yeah we are working on that yeah"
17935680,17939920," it's like basically done really yeah what about like where you left off"
17939920,17942400," yeah oh what really and it'll like resume and everything"
17942400,17946400," oh yeah why are you why is all this stuff launching in like a big"
17946400,17949360," burst i mean i do know the answer to that but why don't you explain it to them"
17949360,17952960," because it felt like nothing was happening for like a year and then now"
17952960,17955440," you're like yeah you can edit your things and you've got"
17955440,17958320," color coding in the chat and you've got this and you got that"
17958320,17962080," who cares that you know the entire team is busy dealing with like"
17962080,17967440," you know uh major security event we're gonna launch everything now anyway let's go"
17967440,17971360," uh"
17971360,17974160," it already attempts to track it is super doesn't work"
17974160,17978560," yeah okay you can't say that without context jade this is this is why"
17978560,17982000," we can't do the public stand-ups thing get"
17982000,17986320," tracked jade in because it's not it's not all in"
17986320,17991920," anyways it's fine it's coming um we uh"
17991920,17995200," this stuff makes me sad to talk about so i don't like really want to go over it"
17995200,17998000," like a bunch of times i've sort of talked about it on a show in the past"
17998000,18002240," our our lead developer for for floatplane absolutely"
18002240,18006560," fantastic dude and i miss him a lot um but he's been"
18006560,18012880," out sick for over a year technically within that amount of time"
18012880,18017200," there was time where he was back but it was for very very short bursts"
18017200,18020480," we you know want to do everything we can to support him we wish him absolutely"
18020480,18025600," nothing but the best you know um and we're we've tried in response we've"
18025600,18031440," tried to expand the team to try to his contributions to the team were"
18031440,18036800," immense to say the least um and we've tried to to hire to try to bring us"
18036800,18041040," back to strengthen um do other stuff but it's like if"
18041040,18045360," connor mck david got sick and you know they tried to just like"
18045360,18049520," hire a replacement it's it's hard there's a hockey"
18049520,18052640," reference for y'all right and and the the new devat devs that we've"
18052640,18056240," we've brought on are like absolutely coming up to speed and working really"
18056240,18059040," well and like the team is absolutely getting back to force and that's part of"
18059040,18062640," what you're seeing but there's one connor mck david"
18062640,18068880," missing missing him sucks um we for a long time we're kind of waiting for him"
18068880,18072320," to come back he was working on a on a major platform upgrade"
18072320,18076400," and instead of continuing the work on the major platform upgrade"
18076400,18078960," um because he kind of wanted to just finish it"
18078960,18085520," himself um we decided to work on things and"
18085520,18088960," set them to wait basically because they were effectively blocked by"
18088960,18093440," the platform upgrade um you came back for a little bit"
18093440,18097840," was here for a little bit got sick again um and at that point in time"
18097840,18101680," i had to make the decision that i probably should have made like a year ago"
18101680,18106240," um but i didn't want to make this decision which was just to finish it"
18106240,18110080," anyways pick up his work and carry it through the finish line"
18110080,18114000," um so we did that and it was a very big challenge"
18114000,18117920," but the team rallied got behind it a lot of different people worked on a lot of"
18117920,18120000," different things they hadn't necessarily worked on before"
18120000,18123760," and we carried it through the finish line um not 100 percent of it"
18123760,18129200," certain bits we left behind um but we carried what we reasonably could and"
18129200,18132640," what we had that's a really long story but we we carried what we could through"
18132640,18135200," the finish line and that's the beta site and it's"
18135200,18138480," awesome um and then the team that has been working on"
18138480,18143200," features waiting for this this whole time is now releasing their features"
18143200,18146480," so there's a lot of features because we waited for a long time"
18146480,18149680," um and they're good and it's really cool"
18149680,18154400," so you're now getting things like uh the the watch time"
18154400,18158800," history jump back to where you were tool thing is going to be coming soonish"
18158800,18162240," because that was originally worked on like"
18162240,18167600," a really long time ago but just blocked for a super long time we were in"
18167600,18172560," the worst development hell i've like basically ever even heard of"
18172560,18176640," for a long time tomorrow of a purgatory and now we're"
18176640,18183280," we're coming out of it yeah which is which is a good feeling because we're"
18183280,18187200," now finally on the other end um it took us a really long long time to get here"
18187200,18190640," and i appreciate you guys sticking with us um but yeah more cool things are"
18190640,18194320," coming i will say um after a lot of these like"
18194320,18198880," feature launches get into beta and then after the beta actually releases"
18198880,18207040," um it's we're gonna want to spend some time on"
18207040,18210320," two things um i'm not gonna explain what they are this can turn into really"
18210320,18212320," long conversation are you having an internal float plane meeting or are"
18212320,18215360," you talking to the audience right now this is a problem i can talk for way"
18215360,18219920," too long so sometimes lana's and i's meetings go for far too long um but"
18219920,18225040," he said fart we i stole i stole a naming scheme from uh"
18225040,18229120," from ubi software embo six and it's project health we want to work on"
18229120,18232640," something that i'm calling project health uh where we need to spend some time on"
18232640,18234720," platform health and tech debt and stuff like that"
18234720,18239200," but um yeah anyways which will come there's going to be a massive pile of"
18239200,18241680," features before we start doing that and that doesn't mean we're not going to"
18241680,18245200," have any features during that time it does mean that if feature development"
18245200,18249840," happens it has to be wrapped in this this development style that is coming in"
18249840,18252560," with anyways okay uh things are moving again thanks for"
18252560,18256400," sticking with a few quick things thanks katley also regarding the reflective"
18256400,18259680," stripe on the hat i accidentally clicked your thing and it just popped up there"
18259680,18263200," uh we're not planning a reflective stripe on the ltt hat pro but you could"
18263200,18265920," always put a reflective patch on it or something like that if you're a roadside"
18265920,18269280," worker um and regarding attaching the laptop bag to"
18269280,18272160," a backpack i see them as sort of mutually"
18272160,18275200," exclusive products i don't think you would have your backpack"
18275200,18279120," and a laptop bag at the same time you should put your laptop in your backpack"
18279120,18284800," or in your bag um yeah i just i i don't want to design for that i think"
18284800,18290960," that's a super super duper edge case cool"
18290960,18297040," sup linus and luke so what's your favorite type of curry"
18297040,18302160," tie spicy yeah"
18305280,18308880," real real hard-hitting questions"
18308880,18312240," who's that who's that old guy who does the interviews i can never remember his"
18312240,18314480," name"

18318960,18327520," okay were you sleeping were you awake were you bad were you good it's this point"
18327520,18330560," of the evening isn't it"
18331120,18336400," any thoughts on making a dog toy maybe a puzzle type toy it baffles me that"
18336400,18341040," no matter how much money i spend i can find a puzzle toy my dog can't solve in"
18341040,18347680," five minutes a dog puzzle toy um no i can't say that that has ever"
18347680,18351840," occurred to me in a thousand years or nor that it would in a thousand years"
18351840,18356800," we do have a dog when hoodie coming though that i can that i can commit to"
18358160,18362160," you know who it if you did want to make one my mom would actually be a"
18362160,18366400," genuinely extremely experienced and good person to consult i bet she would"
18366400,18369600," yeah i don't intend to yeah it makes sense i mean i'm down to just like hang out"
18369600,18373360," with your mom that's cool but like not doing that"

18391200,18395040," know how ethically the closed or source because there is nothing on the website"
18395040,18399840," about the ethics of the clothes so we currently have a position that"
18399840,18404480," um nik is in the process of drafting that will be posted on the site soon"
18404480,18408800," and it's going to be i think we're internally calling it like a compliance"
