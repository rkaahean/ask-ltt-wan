1000,7640," What is up everyone?"
7640,9240," Welcome to The Wanshow."
9240,12720," We've got a great show lined up for you today."
12720,13720," Thank you, Luke."
13720,15200," That's really helpful."
15200,23000," Lots of fantastic topics, starting, of course, with YouTube hiking, the price of YouTube premium"
23000,29920," literally, literally a day after I go to bat talking about how, well, those are the"
29920,35960," services really expensive to run and there's a lot of challenges and data storage, or burp,"
35960,38600," I was only talking a little bit about that."
38600,44440," Also, we're going to be talking about AMD being kind of boned."
44440,47280," Right now, the situation is not looking good."
47280,51400," They've apparently cut production of their Ryzen 7000 chips."
51400,54080," What else we got lined up today, Luke?"
54080,61320," LTT in other languages, we actually have videos that we can show you on the actual channel."
61320,64440," We can show you how it works and we can show you the dubs."
64440,66000," I have not listened to them."
66000,68680," I will be first time reacting to this."
68680,70120," We'll see how it goes."
70120,72200," We are on Espenio."
72200,73680," On Espenio."
73680,77920," I honestly wasn't entirely sure that I could nail the pronunciation of that and I hadn't"
77920,80480," heard you say it yet, so I didn't want to do it."
80480,83960," Oh, I'm pretty sure I didn't nail it, Luke."
83960,84960," Is that the only one?"
84960,87000," Are we doing more languages beyond that?"
87000,88840," We're starting with Spanish."
88840,91120," Spanish, very cool."
91120,95480," Also, G4 TV is done again."
95480,98000," It's done again, not again."
98000,99320," Maybe not forever."
99320,100320," Who knows?"
100320,102080," But certainly for now."
102080,104480," But the most recent one is done."
104480,105480," Comcast pulled the plug."
105480,106720," We'll talk about that later."
106720,107720," Intro?"
107720,108720," Do I run the intro?"
108720,109720," I guess so."
109720,112160," I certainly can't."
112160,113160," Intro auto."
113160,114160," Got him."
114160,117480," Yeah, it worked."
117480,120120," And Linus, you're clipping a little bit on your side."
120120,122160," Could you move on away or speak quieter?"
122160,125960," I don't think you can do that."
125960,128600," I don't think I can do either of those things."
128600,129600," Okay."
129600,131600," We'll just deal with it."
131600,132600," Nice."
132600,133600," Vessi."
133600,134600," MSI."
134600,135600," And 45 drives."
135600,138600," Thank you very much."
138600,142560," I think this is going to be an interesting show because I realized during the intro that"
142560,144640," Linus does not have a swear button."
144640,145640," Oh, yeah."
145640,148400," I'm going to have to control myself today."
148400,152280," It's also going to be an interesting show because Luke disclosed to me before we started"
152280,153680," that he's on painkillers."
153680,155320," I'm on painkillers."
155320,156320," Let's go."
156320,158280," I don't know if you guys can notice."
158280,160680," But this side of my face is a little swollen."
160680,164120," We'll maybe talk about that later, even though it's kind of gross and not that interesting."
164120,165120," Let's go."
165120,166120," Oh, yeah."
166120,167120," Yeah."
167120,168120," It's an injury."
168120,169120," It's an injury."
169120,170720," It's the one side of Luke's mouth."
170720,171720," You know what I'm saying?"
171720,174040," Just to the one side."
174040,177040," Had some blunt force trauma."
177040,178360," And Linus isn't here."
178360,180360," I wonder what's going on."
180360,181360," He's cheating."
181360,182360," Oh, wow."
182360,184440," That actually hurt."
184440,185440," Okay."
185440,188560," I have to not react to things too hard."
188560,194080," Let's jump right into YouTube hiking the price of premium plans in several countries."
194080,195080," That's right."
195080,201080," Literally the day after I uploaded the video that I teased on Wensho last week where I"
201080,205400," was defending YouTube charging for 4K video."
205400,211160," So putting it behind a premium paywall, YouTube turned around and increased the price of my"
211160,217800," premium family plan from 18 Canadian dollars to 23 Canadian dollars."
217800,222000," Actually, it's a big job."
222000,224040," That is a substantial increase."
224040,225640," What does that work out to?"
225640,228040," Like a 30% hike or something like that?"
228040,231960," I thought it was like 25."
231960,234120," And we are not the only ones to have."
234120,235400," Our prices increased."
235400,244760," The US and the UK went from 1799 of their currency to 2299 and 1999 respectively."
244760,251360," And other regions are getting similar hikes in Argentina where inflation has reached 95%."
251360,254520," The jump is particularly aggressive."
254520,261560," Plans went from 78 US cents to $2.53 US."
261560,268400," So that's like, wow, over tripling."
268400,275280," And then family plans went from $1.17 to $4.55 again, tripling."
275280,277200," That is brutal."
277200,278200," That's crazy."
278200,279200," Additionally."
279200,283120," Now this is something that I feel like we can really dig our teeth into."
283120,287800," YouTube is hiking the price of family plans for users who subscribe to Rappel's App Store"
287800,294040," from 2299 to 2999."
294040,298360," Taking that route has always been more expensive, but YouTube is now explicitly disclosing this"
298360,300160," in their announcement email."
300160,306720," So for the people who are not familiar with why YouTube premium would cost more, Luke,"
306720,307960," what's the deal with that?"
307960,311200," The App Store takes a monstrous, monstrous cut."
311200,315520," This is true on Android and iOS platforms."
315520,317720," I'm not trying to just go after them."
317720,323120," But yeah, these App Stores take huge, huge cuts."
323120,329400," I think generally in the 30% range, which is a lot just for hosting some downloads in"
329400,331040," a store."
331040,338160," Now my understanding is that you weren't allowed to charge essentially a 30% surge charge."
338160,339520," Just to amount more."
339520,340520," To account for it."
340520,343400," But like I thought that was actually against."
343400,345720," They've been shifting the rules on that."
345720,349040," I don't know exactly where it stands right now because the last time that they shifted"
349040,354040," their rules, we matched exactly what their rule change was and then our app got denied"
354040,356280," for following their rules."
356280,359960," And then I had to have like an hour long phone conversation about that and then our app got"
359960,364720," approved because nothing matters apparently."
364720,366440," So I don't know."
366440,373320," Yeah, the line keeps moving because lawsuits and whatnot keep on happening."
373320,374320," That makes sense."
374320,375320," Yeah, that makes sense."
375320,376320," I'm not sure."
376320,379920," But I guess you can now unless we're going to see a huge legal battle between them."
379920,381160," But I'm pretty sure you can."
381160,384680," I think you're allowed to charge a differing amount at this point."
384680,388200," I think that this raises some pretty interesting questions."
388200,389800," Let's get through the price increases."
389800,395760," So original subscribers to YouTube read family plans who were grandfathered in at $14.99"
395760,399840," a month are going to be subject to the new $22.99 price."
399840,405520," But not until April 2023 with everyone else getting the new price on their next billing"
405520,406520," cycle."
406520,412640," And I think that the conversation needs to be why is this allowed?"
412640,420360," This is not a free or ad supported service where as people so helpfully pointed out when"
420360,427320," we were talking about the whole does adblock equal piracy discussion does not actually"
427320,431880," have any kind of explicit contractual agreement."
431880,432880," Yeah."
432880,433880," The platform and the user."
433880,439320," I think that there is certainly a terms of service and there's conversations to be had"
439320,443080," around what the implied agreement is for the use of the platform."
443080,445960," But this is a paid agreement."
445960,452640," How is it exactly that lawmakers have not sort of identified this as something that"
452640,455400," absolutely needs to be stopped?"
455400,460800," This single party renegotiation of the deal?"
460800,463760," Do you feel a little bit like Lando at this point?"
463760,467680," Lando Calrissian."
467680,470200," I enjoy the reference."
470200,471200," I don't know."
471200,479560," Because with inflation we've seen really intense inflation lately."
479560,483840," They mentioned here but in Argentina where inflation has reached 95% it hasn't been that"
483840,488080," bad in Canada or the States but it's still been really really bad."
488080,492520," If you have inflationary periods if you sign an agreement with some company okay I'm going"
492520,496480," to pay what was the original YouTube red one 14.99 I believe."
496480,497480," Yeah."
497480,498480," I'm going to pay 14.99."
498480,499480," Yeah."
499480,503480," In the years that 14.99 doesn't have the same power that it had when you originally signed"
503480,504480," that agreement."
504480,510720," So maybe it could be a situation where like rate increases have to be within a reasonable"
510720,512320," margin or something."
512320,514120," I don't know."
514120,519480," I mean yeah we saw that during the billing cycle so people could cancel."
519480,524840," We saw that in the early days of the pandemic where they mandated that rent could not be"
524840,527120," increased certainly not over a certain amount."
527120,533360," I know there are places where rent increases need to be within a certain percentage or"
533360,535960," they are considered to be illegal."
535960,541640," But you know I guess from my point of view it's just it's not what I agree to."
541640,547120," I don't see why that should be permitted for a service."
547120,554360," I mean you're right obviously if you don't like it you can just not pay for it but they're"
554360,558400," not even they're not even they're not even putting up a facade."
558400,560120," Do you think the timing feels suspicious?"
560120,562360," I'm going to do the right thing."
562360,564920," The timing feels very suspicious to me."
564920,568080," Not based on not based on your video to be clear."
568080,569080," No."
569080,575400," What I'm talking about is the changes coming to Chrome."
575400,579840," When I first read this I was like oh yeah so they're going to like completely screw over"
579840,586560," ad blockers and right before they do that they're going to do a massive rate hike to"
586560,587840," YouTube premium."
587840,593160," This might just be me like finding things where they don't exist but the timing's not"
593160,600560," you know exactly lined up but it's pretty close if I remember correctly the the I don't"
600560,605400," remember the exact verbiage for the change but what they're doing to to Chrome that is"
605400,612120," going to impact ad blockers and probably some other things but very notably ad blockers"
612120,618160," is going to happen I believe in January which at this point is a few months away."
618160,619160," It's not that far off."
619160,620520," Yeah that's pretty soon."
620520,621520," Yeah."
621520,626200," There's some really good questions about this coming in from floatplane chat so first of"
626200,634640," all cast 54 points out that they should at least at the very least not be able to charge"
634640,640280," people the new rate until they click a button that says they're okay with it and they could"
640280,646320," absolutely cancel your service but to me like I remember when we migrated floatplane from"
646320,652960," the LTT forum to its own site to floatplane.com and I remember it being extremely complicated"
652960,661360," to change the terms of a recurring service agreement then this word keeps escaping me"
661360,665840," and you unilaterally there we go that's the word I'm looking for to just unilaterally"
665840,673440," change the terms of the agreement and we ended up having to have people manually go through"
673440,677960," and sign up again for the new site we lost a lot of you."
677960,678960," Interesting."
678960,682960," Interestingly enough I'll throw some context in there that is completely correct that"
682960,687160," was very difficult one of the main reasons why that was difficult is because we were actually"
687160,689440," changing business entities."
689440,694240," So when it was through the forum it was under line is media group when it was through the"
694240,698120," floatplane website it was under floatplane so we were changing business entities there's"
698120,704160," a bunch of issues there because we were transferring payment agreements from one company to another"
704160,708480," and I think that might be possible but it was way beyond us at the time if it is even"
708480,713960," possible at all I don't know so we had to have people manually move themselves over."
713960,719720," The other interesting tidbit is we can absolutely change people's agreements and increase or"
719720,722120," decrease prices at will."
722120,726720," The reason why it's never come up is we're obviously not going to do that because that's"
726720,727720," incredibly stupid."
727720,729720," Speak for yourself."
729720,734080," You'll get wrecked as a company if you do that at least that's been arpeggioed."
734080,738960," So obviously we don't do that but there is ways that you can set up where you can totally"
738960,741400," change people's monthly value."
741400,746120," I love the idea of needing to press a button though because something that we know this"
746120,753480," at floatplane and anybody who has ever done Twitch streaming at a professional level knows"
753480,754560," this as well."
754560,759800," When you have paid subscriptions you will have and I'm saying we know this at floatplane"
759800,763400," I'm not saying it's a good thing it's just something that we have knowledge of because"
763400,765960," if we didn't we would just be stupid."
765960,771240," But if you have paid subscriptions at all there are going to be people that forget about"
771240,772240," them."
772240,776600," Maybe the five bucks or the three bucks or the ten bucks isn't a ton to them."
776600,781480," Maybe they aren't really on top of their credit card statements whatever else."
781480,787240," It's even worse when you sign up for things on yearly plans because when people go to"
787240,790040," review their credit card statements they don't see it coming in all the time."
790040,791720," They get a one in twelve chance to catch it."
791720,792720," Yes."
792720,793720," Yes."
793720,794960," So it's totally a thing."
794960,800520," So if you don't have and a lot of people will also see a charge coming in and they're"
800520,808000," like oh that's Amazon or YouTube or Google or Walmart or whatever."
808000,811760," Like I recognize what this is and this is a payment that I pay every month."
811760,812760," Okay that's fine."
812760,816320," So not necessarily paying too much attention to what the value is but they're like oh"
816320,820840," yeah I subscribe to YouTube premium that's the YouTube premium payment sounds good."
820840,822960," Especially people that have currency conversions."
822960,824640," So that makes sense."
824640,827400," Changing the price sure they send an email."
827400,829960," When's the last time you read a marketing email from YouTube?"
829960,835520," I mean I did read this email because it was like your price is going up."
835520,839440," I tweeted about it because I just felt so..."
839440,841440," I don't know."
841440,842440," I don't know."
842440,845160," I appreciate the irony of the timing."
845160,846760," You know what I learned about this?"
846760,848480," Because I filtered out."
848480,849480," I never even..."
849480,853320," This email never hit my inbox on my personal email because it's a marketing email."
853320,854320," I just filtered out."
854320,855320," I don't care."
855320,857320," I learned about this because you're tweeting."
857320,858320," Oh really?"
858320,859320," Oh that's hilarious."
859320,861480," Because I didn't see the email."
861480,862880," And I'm a YouTube premium person."
862880,863880," So this sucks."
863880,867040," Like I'm not stoked."
867040,871040," Get ready to pay another $5 or $6 or whatever it is."
871040,872040," Yeah."
872040,877720," Black Spectre over in float playing chat asks I'm still keeping my $3 plan right?"
877720,878720," Yeah."
878720,883720," I mean I am also on the 4k plan but it's always good knowing I can fall back to the $3 plan"
883720,885000," if I need to wait."
885000,891000," You have two active subscriptions to float playing so that you can have the 4k tier"
891000,896840," and you can also take your grandfather's OG tier status in case you need it."
896840,904160," So you're actually paying $13 a month to retain the ability to pay $3 a month if you"
904160,905160," need it in the future."
905160,906160," They would need two accounts."
906160,907160," Are you sure that's how that's right?"
907160,912360," I think you need a financial advisor because that is not great planning actually."
912360,914360," Hey, thank you for the $13."
914360,920920," Someone in chat said I never got an email and my payment is $10 and my special."
920920,922640," I don't know how your payment is $10."
922640,926880," I'm not sure what currency you're paying in but you haven't heard of YouTube."
926880,928520," Premium ever being $10."
928520,929520," Yeah."
929520,930520," So you must be in a different region."
930520,934600," Maybe your region isn't affected by this."
934600,936000," I don't know."
936000,937000," I don't know."
937000,938000," This is hilarious."
938000,940680," I wonder how many of our float playing subscribers are duplicates."
940680,942680," Now I want the team to go look into that."
942680,947560," Like how many of these accounts are coming from the same IP all the time and stuff?"
947560,948560," Oh."
948560,953320," I'm like, have identical names and use the same credit cards or whatever."
953320,955920," Yeah, that would be a fair amount of digging."
955920,958000," Yeah, I don't think you need that."
958000,959840," You guys should just not pay us twice."
959840,962520," So, yeah, I mean, you can if you want."
962520,965280," I'm not going to refuse to take it."
965280,968680," But you should just buy more stuff on LTT store."
968680,972440," That's smarter because then you get like shirts and stuff."
972440,977160," Nicholas N asks, what I want to know is if this $5 increase is going to benefit the"
977160,981160," creators that I watch and that is one silver lining."
981160,987680," That is one part of the argument that I made in the 4K should be paid video that at the"
987680,994360," very least what YouTube is doing through their really like unprecedented the way that"
994360,1001880," YouTube shares revenue is unlike any other platform the the degree of transparency and"
1001880,1006520," the percentage that they share are way more generous than anyone else."
1006520,1013120," And so there's a reason that creators are constantly trying to figure out how to grow"
1013120,1019560," on YouTube whatever platform people come from the really successful online creators ultimately"
1019560,1021880," end up on YouTube."
1021880,1027320," And the reason for that is because of the way that they share revenue and yes, the answer"
1027320,1034600," is yes, this would be this would be subject to the same revenue sharing agreement that"
1034600,1037840," regular premium is that ad sense is."
1037840,1044200," And it's one of the ways that Google attracts talent to the platform so so so effectively"
1044200,1047120," in a way that just nobody else has figured out how to match."
1047120,1049760," And I shouldn't say has figured out how to match."
1049760,1052480," I think everyone else has figured out how to match it."
1052480,1058520," You have to choose like actually pay money to creators but companies like ByteDance don't"
1058520,1061680," want to do it so they just don't."
1061680,1065920," And I think that's one of the reasons that YouTube has stood the test of time while other"
1065920,1072600," platforms like Vine and like I ultimately believe TikTok come and go and come and go"
1072600,1075440," and come and go while YouTube remains."
1075440,1080440," And you've got a lot of people talking about like especially in the comments on that video"
1080440,1087240," you know angrily and justifiably angry right like I get it but angrily talking about how"
1087240,1091840," this is the last straw YouTube taking away 4K is this is going to be the last straw and"
1091840,1099240," I'm going for an alternative and it's like guys there is no alternative because at the"
1099240,1104440," end of the day content is king that is always going to be true."
1104440,1109960," And so yeah it's tough right."
1109960,1111200," There's some people in Chatsing."
1111200,1112680," Oh sorry go for it."
1112680,1113680," No no go for it."
1113680,1118080," There's some people in Chatsing that they have YouTube premium at 799 apparently that's"
1118080,1121280," a student plan thing there's other people in Chatsing that they have YouTube premium"
1121280,1128120," at 10 bucks which is apparently if you had Google Play music and like maybe something"
1128120,1132120," else you got grandfather multiple times something something something something I don't know"
1132120,1137200," what's going to happen to all of those but in general there is there is a big red."
1137200,1144080," Do you know so it is is what the creators take from premium views a percentage of the"
1144080,1146920," premium price."
1146920,1147920," Correct it is."
1147920,1154360," Okay yeah so the whole premium dollars go into a big fat bucket and then I think I tweeted"
1154360,1161120," out the percentage share incorrectly actually I believe it's 55% to the creators 45 to the"
1161120,1166400," platform and that 45 is not all profit for the platform that includes payment processing"
1166400,1170840," fees which has Luke knows yeah he's not a can be quite substantial."
1170840,1173040," They run their own which I'm sure helps."
1173040,1176720," They do run their own which is cheaper but they're still going to be paying to you know"
1176720,1181200," MX or Visa or whatever other credit card processors that they support or whatever else."
1181200,1184440," And there's cost of maintaining and maintaining your own payment."
1184440,1190880," Yes and and the cost of actually hosting the data and delivering it."
1190880,1198120," So it's a pretty it's a pretty good deal for creators which is why the creator ecosystem"
1198120,1205760," has just blossomed into this this vibrant community that they have now and they have"
1205760,1212000," so much first movers momentum on this I just don't see realistically how anyone is going"
1212000,1213840," to catch them."
1213840,1215720," Yeah I've always kind of seen YouTube that way."
1215720,1222760," I don't think I don't know if it was last week but we were talking about like what resolutions"
1222760,1227640," would you still watch YouTube at and it was like basically whatever because where else"
1227640,1230360," am I going to go for this."
1230360,1236280," And it's like it gets to the point where it's like if the resolution goes so low you just"
1236280,1240440," don't watch videos because where else are you going to go."
1240440,1245920," Which vaud does not cover what YouTube does at all daily motion does not cover what YouTube"
1245920,1248440," does at all like no one else is in that game."
1248440,1249440," Like Fermio get real."
1249440,1250440," Not a chance."
1250440,1255600," Fermio if anything has made themselves has made it even more clear in the last like year"
1255600,1263040," that they are not interested in chasing that ad supported free content mega site."
1263040,1264040," It's really hard."
1264040,1272040," Yeah it's super hard lumber wand over in YouTube chat I know there's a first time for everything"
1272040,1277840," says so if I have premium and ad block does that money still get properly attributed to"
1277840,1280160," the creators that I watch."
1280160,1285400," Well my question is why do you have ad block if you have premium."
1285400,1291560," But also yes your premium watch time as long as you're signed in gets divvied up according"
1291560,1296840," to watch time or sorry your premium money gets divvied up to the creators you watch"
1296840,1301080," according to watch time ratios yes that's right."
1301080,1304720," Yeah people have asked a bunch of times like why don't you make free ad sported tears on"
1304720,1308240," flow plan because it's an insane amount of work."
1308240,1313640," Like it's it's a massive amount of work to broker those advertising deals or you're just"
1313640,1317640," jumping on something like YouTube AdSense anyways."
1317640,1321440," Yeah yeah you're giving Google a cut."
1321440,1325920," Then you can't be competitive with them regardless so like what is what is the value"
1325920,1332120," ad here like it's it's it's tough it's a it's a hard space to be in okay."
1332120,1336680," This kind of leads into one of our discussion questions which is why does YouTube seem so"
1336680,1342240," unconcerned about the potential for moves like this to push users towards ad blockers."
1342240,1347240," So they're not concerned I don't think about users just leaving the site altogether I think"
1347240,1353960," maybe they've gotten a little complacent but also rightfully so but as for ad blockers"
1353960,1362560," I mean Luke you have the you have the technical capacity to block ads on YouTube but you subscribe"
1362560,1367360," to YouTube premium and you seem to have telegraphed earlier in the show that you intend to pay"
1367360,1375320," the the new $22.99 price for premium as opposed to setting up a I mean I don't even know how"
1375320,1381120," to completely block YouTube ads like I know on on mobile it's a little challenging on"
1381120,1383120," TV it's very challenging."
1383120,1389120," Well on mobile you can just look into mobile like braver whatever with an ad blocker but"
1389120,1394640," on on TV I believe it's quite challenging and and you won't get your 4k anyway if that"
1394640,1399280," was your goal on mobile if you use an alternate browser."
1399280,1408080," There are there are other ways on mobile and you can still get your 4k but I have premium"
1408080,1413200," so I don't care and I don't want to talk about it but there yeah on on TV I have no"
1413200,1419440," idea because I've never been interested in watching YouTube on TV to be completely honest"
1419440,1426720," so I haven't looked into it myself on mobile it's definitely possible on on computer is"
1426720,1434400," definitely possible. I did mention earlier in in I believe it's January someone manifest"
1434400,1439640," v3 is coming that's going to mess with ad blockers maybe we'll see if that'll that'll"
1439640,1446200," push that down in regards to ad blocking I do think this will cause a little bit of that"
1446200,1454160," I do question how many people would go from paying for it to ad blocking it because of"
1454160,1459640," this change I'm sure it will be some but will it all be increased amount that they'll make"
1459640,1465160," from charging way way more like this is a massive increase."
1465160,1470720," You know what I actually I want to play devil's advocate here counterpoint I actually think"
1470720,1477120," the odds of someone who was paying before turning to ad luck assuming they for whatever reason"
1477120,1483040," couldn't keep paying their premium subscription if this was one cappuccino too far right you"
1483040,1489320," know okay so they unsubscribe it's a lot I actually I disagree I think that they would"
1489320,1495360," be more likely than a typical user because they are a probably an enthusiast user of the"
1495360,1501720," platform one that was willing to pay so one that probably consumes a lot and be have probably"
1501720,1508400," grown very accustomed to not seeing ads on YouTube so I would I would actually imagine"
1508400,1514120," these people digging pretty hard for an alternative I mean I'm going to I'm going to reiterate"
1514120,1519280," my my my private hearing stance and that's that using the platform in a way that does"
1519280,1524240," not compensate creators for their work is detrimental to the platform that you appear"
1524240,1533240," to be enjoying and may claim to like the content on and so you know make of that what you will"
1533240,1537880," and make your decision accordingly but that doesn't change that people are are going to"
1537880,1543920," be I think surprised especially if they've been on premium for a while by how many flippin"
1543920,1553000," ads are on YouTube now yeah yeah I mean I wouldn't even know any time I open in the"
1553000,1557680," wrong browser I run away immediately because I hate I hate seeing the ads for me it's it's"
1557680,1564360," a it's a big multi-tiered thing where I I want to support other creators on on YouTube"
1564360,1569440," because I watch a bunch of YouTube and I know they get better cuts when I'm watching as a"
1569440,1574240," premium subscriber so I think that's cool I like that part of it I like that there's"
1574240,1581440," no ads and I don't feel bad about it I understand that there is actually a huge amount of cost"
1581440,1587360," so just blocking all the ads on YouTube feels a little wonky when I feel quite strongly"
1587360,1590760," about the whole Malvertizing thing I don't think I need to go over that for like the"
1590760,1598640," 20th time on Wanshow but I don't necessarily think that Malvertizing on YouTube is actually"
1598640,1605400," a big problem maybe it is but I've never heard of it being a problem I I mostly am"
1605400,1611120," interested in in stopping those types of problems outside on on other other parts of the internet"
1611120,1617280," but yeah supporting a platform that I use a ton that I know costs a lot to run and being"
1617280,1621640," able to support other creators that I actually want to support through doing that knowing"
1621640,1626680," that they make more money off of it all of those things together makes it pretty reasonable"
1626680,1631080," for me instead of just presenting problems then why don't we why don't we talk solutions"
1631080,1637840," I mean I would never advise someone to circumvent the terms of service of a website."
1637840,1645400," I'm sorry excuse me sorry I thought excuse me you know I would I would never say something"
1645400,1651000," like that but if it really is a step too far I mean one of the things that struck me about"
1651000,1656440," this price increase is that even though it's like a 30% increase or 25% increase or whatever"
1656440,1666760," it's still $3.33 US per member of my family a family plan is is $23 a month or whatever"
1666760,1672120," Canadian and I have five people using it yeah I'm kind of sitting here going you know what"
1672120,1677960," it's it's kind of funny how common it is right for people to share a Netflix account"
1677960,1683840," and yet I almost never see anyone talking about sharing a YouTube premium account and"
1683840,1688280," I understand it's less convenient to share a YouTube premium account just because there's"
1688280,1692880," so many other Google services that you might use that you might want you might actually"
1692880,1700000," want to contribute to informing your your recommendations and things like that like"
1700000,1707000," it's such a personalized service but I mean we use to talk about it yeah if the choice"
1707000,1710960," is to not that's true we used to talk about it because you shamelessly were piggybacking"
1710960,1715040," off of my family plan yeah actually yeah another another you're not trying how can"
1715040,1721840," you do this to me I'm sorry first child Luke actually now that I think about it no I was"
1721840,1726120," being done before you don't actually have to share the login anyway no you get up to"
1726120,1730600," five accounts on the single family plan so I wouldn't I wouldn't talk about you know"
1730600,1734080," circumventing terms of service that would never be a thing that I would talk about I"
1734080,1740560," just I think that it's worth you know considering if maybe there could be ways that are not"
1740560,1750320," as detrimental to creators for people to help to offset some of the increasing cost yeah"
1750320,1756200," for sure there's I think there are and just like you can talk about exploits and bugs"
1756200,1764440," and systems without encouraging people to do them there are definitely ways to yeah reduce"
1764440,1772160," reduce the impact of this change for sure like using Firefox in January for no specific"
1772160,1778440," reason or or or yeah potentially expanding your family"
1778440,1786040," yeah I mean really aren't we all family yeah in the tech community yeah why I feel like"
1786040,1791960," we're just all family just and so it's a big happy place family yeah with that family"
1791960,1797560," spirit in mind it really does just seem like kind of a kind of an obvious middle ground"
1797560,1803120," like I pay literally you know from myself I pay 350 right a month for YouTube premium"
1803120,1807520," that seems that seems sustainable forever they could double the price and I would still"
1807520,1814160," find that to be quite reasonable and I just want to say you know no matter who you are"
1814160,1823280," you probably have four friends and if you don't I'm so sorry to hear that but you know"
1823280,1827560," it's it could be a goal for you you might you might not have four friends that all want"
1827560,1837040," to pay for YouTube but you might find them I wouldn't be surprised if there was like"
1837040,1843240," a discord server or something that sprung up which was like oh man to find the amount"
1843240,1847280," of feels bad man and forever alone I mean that's in twitch chat though I mean we knew"
1847280,1850520," they didn't have friends because they're hanging out with like people who don't know"
1850520,1864360," they exist in hot tubs oh man all these parasocial relationships I know right if you have four"
1864360,1873400," non-stop social for you can't attack them for parasocial relationships wait why not because"
1873400,1882560," we're not gonna have any viewers yeah oh ever you'll keep watching yeah that's the thing"
1882560,1886200," about parasocial relationships you can make fun of them for it and they'll still do it"
1886200,1897400," anyway yep it's all stop barrington whoa no Jake Jake he's one of our most OG OG OG followers"
1897400,1912200," yeah all of all of all of what playing chat feels extremely called out all right is it"
1912200,1920520," six people you and five others no I think it's no five total I believe I don't know yeah"
1920520,1923800," I'm not sure yeah because otherwise I have no excuse for not having Luke on our family"
1923800,1933440," yeah oh man bullying everyone this has gone extremely well this last little bit why don't"
1933440,1942120," we move on to our next topic should we do AMD yeah let's do AMD because they they they"
1942120,1947880," about to get done yeah after launching with a fairly strong showing with rise in 7000 AMD"
1947880,1953840," looked like they might be doing pretty okay but Intel was looming with 13th gen Raptor"
1953840,1960320," Lake CPUs and they may have cut the celebration short apparently it's been a little rough"
1960320,1968160," launched yesterday the new CPUs posted impressive numbers with the core 913 900 K these names"
1968160,1974440," are getting really long apparently it is manager plus five by the way so yeah six people even"
1974440,1978320," cheaper than I thought okay sorry carry on"
1978320,1987160," yeah but yeah apparently they're topping the charts over AMD's more expensive 16 core rise"
1987160,1993880," in 979 50 X in all but the most heavily multi threaded workloads which does make sense can"
1993880,2001400," we talk about that for a moment I feel like much there much ado gets made of multi threaded"
2001400,2007840," performance but for the average consumer what most of like yeah outside of like maybe four"
2007840,2013120," four threads four to eight threads is anything you do actually having heavily multi threaded"
2013120,2017280," like to be clear it's pretty we're not going to stop talking about multi threaded performance"
2017280,2023880," in reviews because it has been and continues to be a very forward looking way of measuring"
2023880,2029840," the performance of a CPU because theoretically in the future workloads will come but for"
2029840,2036120," the average consumer who doesn't spend all day you know doing that CPU video encoding"
2036120,2043280," for peak quality or you know rendering out complex scenes in blender I mean show of hands"
2043280,2048040," like Luke want to throw up a poll on the float playing chat how many of you actually use"
2048040,2056080," blender like other than to dink around with it once a quarter you know how important is"
2056080,2061960," multi threaded performance oh this is a great comment in twitch chat was bound to happen"
2061960,2072240," eventually kelton says e-cores are cinevention answers yeah oh let's get this poll going"
2072240,2078640," do you actually use blender on a regular basis 20 percent we've got 80 82 83 percent saying"
2078640,2085960," no we've got a couple percent saying yes and then we've also got like 15 percent liars"
2085960,2091280," in there I also yeah yeah I was gonna say like I really wonder how many of the yeses"
2091280,2098600," are people just being like I am these good okay come on I regret my thread ripper every"
2098600,2107360," single day though yeah yeah how's that upgrade path going for you Dan I yearn for death I"
2107360,2114280," spent so much money on that computer so much money and it's it's a multi thread is said"
2114280,2120640," this is one of the reasons why future proofing is is something that we always kind of scoff"
2120640,2126400," at a little bit I'll be a word yeah because when when people when people talk about like"
2126400,2135120," oh I want to like really multi thread capable CPU because the future it it's not really"
2135120,2145280," happening it's kind of hard to dev software like that so people just don't do it BT arc"
2145280,2151080," cellists in twitch chat says every last furry is destined to learn blender for VR there's"
2151080,2158720," literally dozens of us yes that's that is true I guess that makes I wanted to build myself"
2158720,2166720," a I wanted to build myself a model for beat same or saber streaming and I realized that"
2166720,2172040," even though there are kind of redone no not a furry one necessarily even though there are"
2172040,2178560," pre done like starting points and there are guides you have to really get into the weeds"
2178560,2184880," with modeling software to to like draw it and bring it up and I'm like oh this is far"
2184880,2189120," beyond my skills it would be I would be far better off just paying someone to do this"
2189120,2194800," then I looked into how much it costs and I was like ready player now or whatever it's"
2194800,2200400," called that that service that just like you pick some generic attributes and assets and"
2200400,2206800," it just starts out a model for you that'll do for me it's it's totally free man I so back"
2206800,2211440," when I was in high school I've talked about my high school computers teacher a few times"
2211440,2215400," and I mentioned a few shows back that he he created this like 3D game programming course"
2215400,2222160," for us we we had to do some basic 3D modeling in that class and we used this program called"
2222160,2229040," milk shape so it sounds like milkshake but it's milkshake yeah and I just googled it"
2229040,2235360," to see if it was still a thing and I don't think so but yeah I used to do some of that"
2235360,2244400," stuff one time ago kind of cool anyways um yeah we should continue that also people"
2244400,2247920," are asking if merch messages are not a thing today I don't actually have the dashboard open"
2247920,2254720," are they a thing yeah they are um I've only gotten eight oh maybe it's because we didn't"
2254720,2259440," talk about them guys so if you want to send a message into the show the way to do it is through"
2259440,2264560," merch messages not twitch bits not super chats nothing like that you want to send a merch message"
2264560,2270080," all you got to do is head over to lttstore.com and in the checkout you're going to see a field"
2270080,2275680," where you can enter your merch message and it'll either be replied to by Dan it'll show up on the"
2275680,2279920," bottom of the screen if you just want to do like a shout out or something like that or"
2279920,2287120," luke and I might address your comment or your question live towards the end of the show the lttstore.com"
2287120,2294240," deal of the week is the jerry rig knife is back in stock and if you pick up a 1200 by 700 desk"
2294240,2302800," pad and add a knife to your cart the knife is free also oh this is sick luke bring them up we have"
2302800,2308960," shoelaces now there they are they come with this adorable little power supply shaped box that has"
2308960,2314880," the shoelaces coming out like cables and the reason that these are notable is if you have or want to"
2314880,2322880," get the RGB hoodie these are actually the same laces so you can get that drip going on or however"
2322880,2328720," it is that you use that word yeah by having your shoelaces match your hoodie drawstring which"
2328720,2335600," I thought was pretty cool oh yeah but there's like there's a fan on this side of the power"
2335600,2340560," supply and there's even like the grill the power switch and the plug on the back it's kind of cool"
2340560,2345280," this is pretty I'm not going to claim there's anything special about the shoelaces other than"
2345280,2350960," that they match the hoodie drawstring I've got some like white stitching pattern on them"
2351920,2358240," yep I don't know yeah they feel nice and sturdy I wonder if we can do a close up with a producer"
2358240,2365360," cab let's see so the 1200 by 700 desk pad then add a knife and the knife is free it's a sick deal"
2365360,2371920," that is a 15 us dollar value and you can use it to send in a merch message you have the box we also"
2371920,2376400," we also just generally have the knives in stock so if you don't need a desk pad you can always just"
2376400,2381680," like pick up a jerry rig everything knife I think there's probably a conversation to be had around"
2381680,2388640," should we just carry more influence or merch like is there any reason not to just have other people's"
2388640,2394160," merch on our store oh I don't think so why not maybe we should yeah obviously why not"
2394160,2401040," yeah all right let's continue the AMD discussion especially if there's something that isn't just"
2401040,2407760," like a shirt yeah you know hey turn everyone's shirts uh yeah continued AMD discussion"
2408960,2417280," so all of this the all of this AMD crushing power does come at a currently trendy cost which is"
2417280,2424160," kind of surprising to me that this is currently trendy but the power consumption is monstrous"
2424160,2431360," apparently our testing saw a peak of 350 watts but other outlets measured power draw up to 400 watts"
2431360,2438960," and beyond with the limiters removed and with throttling on 360 millimeter AIO coolers"
2438960,2448720," wow so you basically need chilled water yeah we're bringing it back we're bringing the chiller"
2448720,2455840," going sub sub ambient voice yeah sub ambient and and uh Anthony has a note saying this means"
2455840,2463920," it's possible to approach a kill a lot of sustained draw for a personal home computer I added that"
2463920,2474560," little bit in between CPU and GPU alone with a 4090 test rig wow that's crazy especially when"
2474560,2480320," like so many other things are trending in the other direction and going down in power draw we"
2480320,2486000," have the the top end of performance on and on personal computers just cranking power draw as"
2486000,2491680," far as I can tell pretty much as hard as they can you know what we've actually got a video coming"
2491680,2504480," where we run uh an RTX 4090 and a Ryzen 9 7900x on a 550 watt power supply and we play cyberpunk"
2505120,2513360," sustained on a 550 watt power supply so and and this is giving up like less than 5 performance"
2513360,2519600," one of the cool things about the new Ryzen 7000 series we haven't tested it with 13th gen yet"
2519600,2526960," it's possible others have I just I haven't looked yet but um with Ryzen 7000 and with the RTX 4090"
2526960,2534720," is that they actually undervolt extremely well and you can achieve very surprising wasn't"
2534720,2540720," undervolting I thought it was lowering the power target is it well it's a combination so you lower"
2540720,2547040," your power target until you find a point where it starts to behave kind of weird and then you you"
2547040,2554080," set your uh you set your turbo target to kind of whatever megahertz you're running at at that point"
2554080,2558960," then you adjust your voltage current anyway we showed it in the video it's a it's a process though"
2558960,2565760," uh but basically we managed to get it running stably on a 550 watt power supply without actually"
2565760,2570720," giving up a ton of performance to be clear that wasn't with me running two power viruses at once"
2570720,2577440," that was with me running an actual game uh but in in real world usage I think it would probably be"
2577440,2583760," stable which isn't to say you should ever do that no no no no I'm just saying that you can lower the"
2583760,2591520," power consumptions of these new of these new components it just might take a little bit of work but the"
2591520,2597840," thing is that we've reached the point where the work might be worth it man like it used to be that"
2597840,2602480," we would put all this work into tuning for more performance right with overclocking but now with"
2602480,2608160," energy prices going the way they are particularly in Europe right it could actually save you hundreds"
2608160,2614720," of dollars over the lifespan of this computer to undervolt it yeah yeah someone said uh let me"
2614720,2623600," see if I can find it again with someone in I'm a flanker in in flowplane chat says with current"
2623600,2635440," UK pricing for electric that's 34p an hour for gaming wow that's gonna add up yeah it's gonna"
2635440,2643120," add up a lot actually that's uh I mean man that's a question that's like that's like what it cost"
2643120,2649280," at the arcade you know when we were young right like if you if you had to put a coin right if you"
2649280,2655120," had to put a quarter in the machine every hour would you game as much as you do or is it just the"
2655120,2658960," fact that you're not really thinking about it because it's coming in on a monthly billing cycle"
2661360,2666560," if I had to put a quarter in every hour I probably wouldn't I think I would genuinely play last games"
2666560,2674320," right like that's that's a pretty high friction transaction actually yeah and to be clear I still"
2674320,2682640," I still believe that gaming remains one of the best bang for the buck entertainment mediums right"
2682640,2688160," like you can there's especially with free to play games that you really do not have to put money"
2688160,2694880," into you know games like League of Legends for example um you know like there's there's nothing"
2694880,2699760," that comes even close you know you look at it compared to like a movie going to the movies or"
2699760,2705120," going paintballing or whatever else it is like gaming is is an unbelievable bang for the buck"
2705120,2711600," assuming you actually do it enough to offset the the upfront cost but man that starts to eat into"
2711600,2717760," it a little bit 25 cents every hour my goodness and it's a lot more than that that's closer to 50 cents"
2717760,2723600," so if you had to put you had to pop a quarter into your desk every half hour I do not see you"
2723600,2732080," doing that sir yeah no that's yeah sometimes sure but not not I would probably reduce yeah"
2732080,2740000," um to that's wild I want to figure out exactly how much it is"
2744080,2750480," what is so that's sense right p pence is it yeah yeah zero zero point three three four"
2750480,2757920," yeah yeah you're right 52 cents that's a lot yep that's actually like a ton"
2757920,2765040," yeah my solar panels are starting to look like a pretty smart investment yeah yeah"
2765040,2770560," I remember when solar panels up here were were not um obviously they've gotten a lot more and"
2770560,2776160," they've got a lot more efficient since then um they're still stupid here sir because our"
2776160,2780320," power is still cheap I didn't want to rub it in for everybody falling water but you know the whole"
2780320,2787200," falling water might not keep happening thing is coming yeah so we did a um we did a little"
2787200,2793440," work field trip to bant for number of years ago uh Luke didn't come he didn't technically work for"
2793440,2798320," Linus Media Group at that time long story anyway the point is we went to see this glacier and they"
2798320,2805600," had all these markings on the ground for where the glacier used to be where it is now and where it"
2805600,2811840," like used to used to be and where it's going to be and sort of just tracking this receding giant"
2811840,2819520," glacier and they were like yeah so on you know 30 to 50 years this thing will be gone and guess"
2819520,2826240," what that means for hydroelectric power I was like uh like I could live to see the end of cheap"
2826240,2832320," energy in western Canada which is sort of mind-blowing and what are we going to do"
2832320,2838560," I don't think anyone's talked about it yeah yeah yeah and it because like everyone that I know"
2838560,2844400," just kind of shrugs it at power that lives here to be clear uh because we've always been like"
2844400,2853040," where it's falling water it's fine um and I mean it is for now for now yeah a lot of people asking"
2853040,2860000," why I'm in two dimensions uh budget cuts sorry yeah I have to afford my new more expensive"
2860000,2866320," YouTube premium somehow yeah it's true yeah yeah we are we're going to spread the spread the bird"
2866320,2875280," note you know um but yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so these new AMD AMD chips um"
2875280,2882560," the biggest advantage the new chips have over AMD is one that AMD once held and it's the platform"
2882560,2888320," unlike Ryzen 7013th Gen Core can run on last gen motherboards with a simple bios update"
2888320,2893760," and they can run with DDR4 memory which continues to be much less expensive than DDR5"
2893760,2902240," in fact fast DDR4 didn't harm performance much if at all versus fast DDR5 um speaking of our"
2902240,2907760," testing we've got another sort of conversation topic here and it's what the heck is going on"
2907760,2913760," with all the errors in the videos lately and you know I've talked to the team about this and from"
2913760,2919440," my point of view um you know I didn't really want to say much about it because my goal would not be"
2919440,2925680," to throw any particular person or team under the bus because it's a little more complicated than"
2925680,2932880," that all I really wanted to say publicly was we owe you guys nothing but the best we are striving"
2932880,2940640," to deliver nothing but the most accurate coverage but the reality of it is that we are going through"
2940640,2947520," a bit of a learning period right now um one of the comments that has come up quite a bit is"
2947520,2954400," why is it that publications with teams literally a tenth or a 20th the size of our company are"
2954400,2961360," able to have their videos go up more accurately and the answer is that actually adding more cooks"
2961360,2967840," to the kitchen does not necessarily make it a smoother process and we're learning a lot um"
2967840,2973360," every single time it's a different breakdown if that helps you guys at all to understand"
2973360,2979200," what's happening on our side and every single time we are patching those holes so we won't"
2979200,2984880," break down there again and it's just going to take us a little while to get the hang of this"
2984880,2992720," between the writing team and labs and the editing team there are a lot of moving parts and we are"
2992720,3002160," we are absolutely going to do our best to um get to the point where you guys don't feel like you need"
3002160,3009280," to read reviews from multiple outlets but we will still absolutely recommend that you always"
3009280,3014080," yeah you always look at coverage from multiple outlets that's something I've always said it's"
3014080,3020800," something that I always will say yeah okay I didn't know that was a problem in the video"
3020800,3030960," um we should probably talk sponsors yeah good call the show was brought to you by vesi footwear"

3189600,3195120," Luke uh should we should we play it for them now or should we play it for them a little bit later"
3195120,3199520," I feel like we should maybe a little later play it for them and then talk about it because it's"
3199520,3207120," cool and it's not like it's happening now it has happened it's live you know and if people don't"
3207120,3210640," want to watch it through the stream I'm gonna play it through the stream so if you want to watch it"
3210640,3214480," through the stream you can you can just do that but you can also bring it up on your own end like"
3214480,3219120," it's it's live and it functions now something that I didn't know until I sat down and we went over"
3219120,3225840," this is that uh you don't have to make a new channel for it anymore so this is just on the actual main"
3225840,3232080," channel this is a really cool feature so we can see what you're doing so cool that's not what I meant"
3232080,3238320," I mean I've had a lot of people commenting to whether it's on the is that you don't have to make"
3238320,3245280," a new channel for it anymore so this is just on the actual channel this is a really cool feature"
3245280,3251280," technical difficulties right we'll get there anyways let's turn off that screen sharing right away I"
3251280,3259440," think it's causing echo is that all right well I can there we go I can walk you through the the"
3259440,3263760," visual experience without a natural visible visible indicator so you guys will know what I'm"
3263760,3268080," talking about if you're on youtube in the bottom right hand corner of a video there's the settings"
3268080,3273280," cogwheel we all know it will love it you click on it there's the audio track section now so instead"
3273280,3282160," of just like playback speed annotations quality the things you're used to have got it we should"
3282160,3290560," it's worth mentioning a lot of people during the 4k premium controversy commented criticizing"
3290560,3296480," you know youtube for not innovating like what does there to even do um and there you know again I"
3296480,3302640," don't want to boot lick a trillion dollar corporation or whatever but like scaling scaling the way"
3302640,3308560," youtube scales is really really hard yeah and building new features at scale is really hard and they"
3308560,3313440," absolutely do build new features and this one is one of the coolest ones I've seen in a very"
3313440,3319680," very long time okay luke is showing it to us now so down in the cog you can have multiple audio"
3319680,3327520," tracks on a video now and it appears to be something that you can actually do um that you can actually"
3327520,3335600," add in post like after the fact to existing uploads so what we've done with this particular video is"
3335600,3346240," using google aloud we have created a transcript a spanish translation transcript of the videos"
3346240,3354240," and then we have used um I forget exactly what tool we're using to turn that into like an"
3354240,3361920," an ai voice and then we've done our own uh conversion from our own voices to an ai voice"
3361920,3367600," to kind of fill in the gaps in the translation so the idea is not to do a perfect job of localization"
3367600,3371280," actually here let's let's play it first yeah play it first yeah we'll talk a little bit more about"
3371280,3373440," it i haven't heard this so let's go"

3412960,3438000," [Music]"
3438000,3447760," yeah i'm seeing i'm seeing a lot of people um i'm seeing a lot of people go in either way on this"
3447760,3455040," you know gross doesn't sound human or wow it's surprisingly good almost nothing in between"
3455040,3463120," which is really interesting to me um and i want to clarify that the point of allowed this is"
3463120,3469200," google's translation quote unquote startup is to increase accessibility it's not about"
3469200,3475840," perfection uh but 80 percent of the world does not speak english while the majority of video"
3475840,3484480," content online is in english so bilingual users might be likely to notice issues with pacing"
3484480,3490560," tone and minor translation errors because they can compare against the native english version"
3491280,3497920," but what google has found is that non english speakers are more often just impressed that they"
3497920,3505760," can access the content at all so if we think about it from an accessibility standpoint as opposed to a"
3505760,3516480," perfection standpoint um ferna 182 in floatplane chat says native spanish speaker sounds like a"
3516480,3521680," dub show on tv a few mistakes here and there but overall way better than last time that's good that"
3521680,3526400," was often that that was our goal yeah um yeah pretty much across the board people are saying"
3526400,3532640," not the most accurate but it's okay and yes i know you know if we hired uh like a translation"
3532640,3539040," company and a bunch of voice actors you know mr beast style that might work but okay you got to"
3539040,3544000," think about the scale of what mr beast is doing if he's getting 30 to 50 million views on an"
3544000,3549360," english video and he can assume maybe 25% as much on an alternate language channel"
3549360,3557360," um you know if we only got 25% as many views on one to two million views all of a sudden that would"
3557360,3563520," pretty much eat up whatever money we could have made on on that video like it's not it doesn't"
3563520,3569680," make good business sense but if it's something that we can do relatively easily right like if"
3569680,3575120," it's something that we can do using ai and then just doing spot corrections"
3575120,3582000," ooh that's that's the way for us to tackle it because we upload so much i mean he uploads one"
3582000,3587200," video every like two weeks these days right we're uploading daily so the just the scale of the"
3587200,3592240," cost is enormous i mean we've run into issues with our um with our chinese translation"
3592240,3597280," where it's not even a matter of not being willing to pay for it we just upload so freaking much"
3597280,3603920," that it's hard to find enough people who want to work up it yeah yeah yeah i i mean"
3603920,3612560," being not able to understand it at all because i can't speak a single word of spanish i i think"
3612560,3617760," the tech is really cool um our implementation completely regardless having it so that you can"
3617760,3624640," switch audio tracks like that and having it support uh languages for for the the use case of that"
3624640,3630240," feature is sweet and i i think we should all be pretty happy that that exists on youtube because"
3630240,3636160," of like what lynos is saying the the accessibility stuff um maybe it could be better maybe it could"
3636160,3643040," be worse um i just think it's a really cool feature and i'm i'm stoked i like it when sites like youtube"
3643040,3649440," innovate because there's so much that can be done when you have an audience that is like"
3650800,3657360," as close to the entire planet as you could basically get um so yeah i think it's really cool and i"
3657360,3662480," like that we're using it because why not and from like you know not everything is going to get"
3662480,3666960," translated but this could be a great tool for people looking to learn english as well being"
3666960,3673360," able to listen to it in spanish and then listen to it in english i know that's how a lot of people"
3673360,3678480," too if people want to learn spanish well i wouldn't learn spanish from any i can't"
3678480,3684880," fair that's the only reason i didn't bring that right yeah never mind yeah you might yeah no yeah"
3684880,3686960," you're gonna walk around sounding like a bad translational"
3686960,3693920," which is actually oh man that actually would make for like a good comedy short or something like that"
3693920,3698480," so so why do you learn from bad translations how to speak a language yeah that would be pretty"
3698480,3703680," funny thank you and just like i actually i could even see it being a show like back in the 80s or 90s"
3703680,3707200," like a mr bean style like you have a character whose entire sort of"
3707200,3714160," stick is that they they learned you know the language from from poor translations so they just"
3714160,3719760," are constantly using idioms that make no sense and i i yeah that could be that could be interesting"
3719760,3725920," um did you brat we already have a translation service in china and we have almost a million"
3725920,3730400," subscribers on billy billy but thank you for the suggestion yeah yeah already a thing"
3731280,3736880," yeah i wonder if i get another gold play button i got such a kick out of getting a chinese knock"
3736880,3743040," off of a silver you got the silver one right yeah yeah yeah i'm getting i saw the silver one years"
3743040,3748800," ago yeah i don't know if there's a gold play button on billy billy but i'd be super super down"
3748800,3754640," it's spanish the only other option at the moment or is spanish just the one you went with for the test"
3755600,3763840," uh spanish is the one that probably has the the greatest overlap of people who want to watch ltt"
3763840,3770960," and who don't speak english so like we could have gone for german for example but from my time in"
3770960,3775440," germany i would say that that was probably going to be a big fat waste of time because practically"
3775440,3778880," everyone i met there spoke better english than half the people i went to high school with"
3778880,3785520," like their english schooling is outstanding it's always interesting when you talk to someone"
3785520,3788960," and they're like oh my english is really bad and it's like oh it's fine it's fine it's fine"
3788960,3792640," then they that you actually start having conversations with them and you start kind of wondering like"
3792640,3802640," is their english might be better than mine exactly exactly uh apparently monty python did a bit"
3802640,3807920," with a dodgy translation book like way back in the day so yep there you go yeah it's been done"
3807920,3815360," it's been done people are talking about indian uh yeah one of the benefits of spanish for us"
3815360,3822160," is we happen to have someone on staff who who speaks native uh spanish so that helped a lot uh one of"
3822160,3827600," the challenges with spanish though is that there are a lot of regionalisms that make spanish localization"
3827600,3836160," really tricky oh wait she doesn't speak spanish oh whoa hold on ed's ed's messaging me in real time"
3836160,3842320," here hindy is apparently coming soon do we have someone on staff who speaks hindy who can like check"
3842320,3850720," that well i don't know all right there you go i'm i'm finding out i'm finding new things that's"
3850720,3857040," real time here uh anyway uh so it's really tricky because for spanish different countries and even"
3857040,3862880," regions have their own vocabulary accents and idioms that can make it really really challenging"
3862880,3867600," to translate but i think it's going to be one of those things where you just have to kind of settle"
3867600,3876240," on something and it's at least better than nothing yeah yeah for sure um"
3876240,3885840," shall we talk about g4 oh i mean i guess so as long as we don't say anything mean because it's"
3885840,3893360," it's rude to speak ill of the dead oh i gotta say this before we start so rest in peace zombie g4"
3893360,3900960," tv uh those of you who were super stoked on the return of g4 um maybe maybe what i'd like to hear"
3900960,3907680," is why because as someone who wasn't really didn't really have any access to traditional media at the"
3907680,3913360," time that g4 was taking off like we didn't have a cable tv subscription at that time like i didn't"
3913360,3920960," watch any tv at that time so i don't have any nostalgia for g4 but it seems like there's a"
3920960,3929360," continued of people that were like super miss g4 and and and loved it and i'd love to hear from you"
3929360,3937040," guys like why yeah people are saying like tech tv was the bomb i know i know chris parello had his"
3937040,3942160," break on like g4 tech tv i think tech tv was like a sub brand of g4 something like that"
3942160,3950640," yeah lots of people never even heard of it oh g4 was better i didn't hear about it"
3950640,3959600," until years later because i ended up watching um adam sessler on a game review channel that i"
3959600,3965840," don't remember the name of anymore um that i believe like all the hosts left and then it was not"
3965840,3971040," cool anymore um but i used to like that game review from g4 bot out tech tv"
3971040,3977120," but but i had never that's the only reason why i knew that g4 existed was people would comment"
3977120,3982720," about him being on it back in the day on that show people talking about screen savers attack of the"
3982720,3988320," show so basically they just had a lot of like really good hosts back in the day it sounds like"
3988320,3998000," a bunch of people call it like a lot of people calling out xplay i don't even know what that is"
3998000,4004160," yeah no no lies right in that cable so we're very ignorant in all this so yeah when it came back"
4004160,4011360," i didn't have the nostalgia around so i didn't uh i didn't go to start watching it because i never"
4011360,4015440," watched it in the first place i got nothing against it um it sucks that it went down"
4015440,4022560," i've heard a lot of different various commentary on this about how they think that"
4022560,4033280," the that space is now pretty well covered by a lot of smaller independent like one to two bit"
4033280,4041600," outfits here in there agile yeah um like i know um one that i i check out all the time is game ranks"
4041600,4047200," that's a relatively small team that i've just been killing it for years so trying to pull together"
4047200,4054320," the the game explain is another really small one that i know absolutely yeah um trying to bring"
4054320,4060160," together this massive group bunch of big names bunch of fantastic hosts i have heard actually very"
4060160,4065360," very good things about a lot of the people that worked on g4 tv so and i know that there are"
4065360,4070960," already people trying to poach them uh both the people that worked behind the scenes and on camera"
4070960,4077120," so i i suspect that the the people that worked there are going to do well uh because apparently"
4077120,4081680," people can't in twitch uh says they had good hosts even today and it still got shut down"
4081680,4086960," Comcast sucks but i i mean i'd like to talk a little bit more about that later let's let's talk more"
4086960,4093360," about that later but yeah Luke korean yeah so like i i i have heard that the the behind the scenes"
4093360,4101600," team was was just absolutely fantastic um i've heard that the the hosts were all really good um"
4101600,4106880," but they they just weren't really getting the viewership that they needed to sustain the cost"
4106880,4112720," of having this apparently again i don't know but i have heard this apparently massive studio and"
4112720,4122080," very extensive staff um because it's expensive it's going to be expensive so yeah yeah it's hard"
4122080,4130640," it is hard to make quality content on an online budget and traditional media like g4's last run"
4130640,4141920," ended in uh 2013 uh back in 2013 it was a lot easier to make money through traditional tv advertising"
4141920,4148240," and cable subscriptions that those numbers have only fallen since then and when you account for"
4148240,4154400," you know inflation your production costs have not gone down so you've got the you've got these lines"
4154400,4160000," that are trending in in the opposite directions that would be helpful for making a production"
4160000,4166240," sustainable and so as much as you might say Comcast sucks and as much as i might not necessarily"
4166240,4170800," disagree with you i think the thing that sucks about them was that they ever thought this was"
4170800,4174640," going to work in the first place this is just clearly a stupid idea there's there's a bunch"
4174640,4180640," of people in chat like what one person um sindy broke it says Comcast did very little marketing"
4180640,4185600," they had an abysmal business and marketing plan they could not figure out how to uh make things"
4185600,4191040," people wanted to watch and that's yeah maybe the production was fantastic and the hosting is"
4191040,4196240," fantastic but if you look like what market do we do marketing is dead sure but i didn't know"
4196240,4200560," where to watch g4 i don't where they own youtube i don't think so why would you care"
4200560,4207040," like if you don't if you didn't find it then you'd like you won't find it like if it was really"
4207040,4214480," good we rely on virality these days algorithmically if it was if it was suitable for our given viewer"
4214480,4220080," it would get served to them yeah so i'm looking at g4 tv's youtube channel and they're getting like"
4220080,4228480," three four thousand views of video um that's just not going to do it for the for the staff that they"
4228480,4234160," had i don't know if everything actually hit the youtube channel um a lot of places use youtube"
4234160,4241680," channel is like partial archive side business thing um but yeah they they uh the the budget was"
4241680,4245840," extremely high and when budgets are extremely high you're going to have to perform at a level"
4245840,4257840," that can pay for the budget and it seems like that wasn't happening um so that's it yeah"
4257840,4262720," sucks but i do think that a lot of these people are going to land on their feet"
4262720,4270000," my cloppelip says says the guy whose entire business is supported by marketing uh yes but not"
4270000,4275600," marketing the show the content speaks for itself we don't we don't market"
4275600,4280240," line of tech tips we don't like buy what like what would you even"
4280240,4286800," a lot of marketing for some websites a lot of marketing for something like a youtube channel is"
4286800,4293680," through recommended stuff right um and is is the platform that you're on i again i don't know if"
4293680,4298080," they were fully on youtube but if they were fully on youtube um then getting three to four thousand"
4298080,4304560," views with the with the team that they had is is just not going to support the um the the math"
4304560,4313360," just doesn't work right um i don't know razrael and twitch chat says i'm sure you guys know better"
4313360,4318240," than i but i assume it failed because of corporate bloat and idiotic budgeting costs on infrastructure"
4318240,4322480," that isn't needed for what they were producing but that's the thing apparently it was like really"
4322480,4329200," good it's just that it's heard a lot of really good things yeah it does cost a lot it legitimately"
4329200,4338000," costs a lot to approach a production like that in a traditional media manner uh and to make it good"
4338000,4343520," and so that's why i mean that's why i think it was done that they even tried not because you know"
4343520,4347680," the hosts weren't great or the showrunners weren't great or whatever else but because it was pretty"
4347680,4354640," clear to me that there just wasn't enough money in it to sustain something like that as as a as a"
4354640,4368640," startup like it it's very very difficult yeah either way condolences for for the team there um"
4368640,4373600," i know i've said it like 14 times but i i think they're going to be okay there's i know of two"
4373600,4378640," different outfits that are currently putting out like hey if you worked there hit us up because"
4378640,4386640," we're we're hiring people like you um so i think they'll be all right but i hope that's true for"
4386640,4391280," for all of them obviously you want people to be able to find gainful employee um"
4391280,4398800," apparently they attacked their followers a lot i yeah i don't know how much that would"
4398800,4407360," suit we ee h we don't like to admit that"
4407360,4411120," fair enough um oh man"
4411120,4418560," apparently talent we're expected to play a role in managing public relations and little action"
4418560,4424400," would be taken by the company in dimes of controversy i don't know what that means um"
4426800,4432080," yeah i don't know a ton about it i just i hope that uh i heard it was good from some people that i"
4432080,4438880," trust and i hope that the the people that were doing a good job in order to make it good land on"
4438880,4448960," their feet and that's pretty much it yeah rip g4 again yeah later yeah it's uh it's especially"
4448960,4454800," troubling just how sudden the shutdown was and plays were informed via email that the LA facility"
4454800,4459520," would be closed and all streams postponed but no word but the network was actually shutting it down"
4459520,4464880," many employees only found out via a memo published on twitter that's just gross yeah i'm"
4464880,4473440," really not enjoying this like modern people getting fired through figuring it out through hearing"
4473440,4480080," it on the news thing um i'm sure to be fair that was a thing in the past as well but i've been hearing"
4480080,4491840," a few of those lately um so yeah there's a whole bunch of employees said there was a ton of"
4491840,4497360," mismanagement and a lack of direction in an interview with the washington post apparently"
4497360,4503440," they wasted a bunch of funding on guest stars and cut staff and uh people said they were underpaid"
4506320,4514160," yeah all right discussion question ltt video game channel when it feels like a matter of time"
4514160,4523120," doesn't it i want to do one for a long time but it's hard there isn't there isn't a ton of money"
4523120,4530000," in it um gaming is is something that the the people that are doing well on youtube in gaming"
4530800,4539360," are huge and they're doing well because their volume is just enormous um and a lot of them have"
4539360,4544160," honestly pivoted slightly out of gaming so that they can get their advertising dollars from segments"
4544160,4549680," that aren't just gaming they can use their audience to uh their audience that is interested in not"
4549680,4553280," just the fact that they're talking about games what they're interested in in the person so i'm not"
4553280,4559280," saying they're using their audience in a negative way uh but they're making forms of content that"
4559280,4564160," aren't just gaming content uh because maybe they don't want to just make gaming content"
4564160,4568800," and also they get to put that video in a different advertising segment than just gaming"
4568800,4580240," which is often a really good thing for for money um so yeah i don't know it's such a saturated space"
4580240,4590320," it's also honest yeah the bands are vicious that's true just to just to put that out there"
4590320,4594720," and i've been one of them um there was i don't know if you guys remember this but"
4594720,4602800," do i bring this up yeah let's go for it um cop head cuphead you remember the launch of"
4602800,4607120," cophead i think we even talked about this on wancho back in the back in the day there was a there was"
4607120,4616960," a game reviewer who couldn't make it through the tutorial oh no it was actually hilarious uh and"
4616960,4626160," and a lot of a lot of reviews coming out about games that are hard or like like let's say cuphead"
4626160,4635680," the cuphead one was like pretty bad uh watching the person's playthrough where they spend whatever"
4635680,4640080," it is like 25 minutes trying to get through the tutorial that should take people like 30 seconds"
4640080,4647760," was was uh was pretty intense um but but watching reviewers rate difficult games really poorly because"
4647760,4655840," they couldn't accomplish it um is is not fun it's not good um but i think i feel like the gaming"
4655840,4661760," audiences is more ready to go after the reviewer in those situations than a lot of other audiences"
4661760,4671360," uh which is which is fine and fair um but when the money's low and the audience is brutal it makes"
4671360,4676240," the yeah business decision competition is high and the competition is very high because there's a"
4676240,4682320," lot of game reviewers and there's a lot of good game reviewers as well we named two of them on the"
4682320,4688480," show it's not like the it's not like there's a there's a hole there that we need to fill um yeah"
4688480,4693280," so like what what could we do differently in that space there's a bunch of people that do"
4693280,4699680," really long form like video essay type content on games that is just amazing like the amount of"
4699680,4705840," research that goes into it is incredible they make these these works of art there's a lot of people"
4705840,4712640," that make shorter form more review punchy type of stuff that is also really good like it doesn't"
4712640,4719360," need us to join it i would enjoy making gaming content definitely doesn't need us in that space"
4719360,4727360," so it's a difficult to talk about uh beat saber map packs yeah but like doesn't that it's like"
4727360,4732480," what would i even contribute and honestly like that's cool how many views is that gonna get"
4732480,4738320," how do we make how do we make a good business call out of line is talking about map packs on"
4738320,4743680," beat saber i think it would probably be a thing where it's just like a passion project um"
4743680,4750080," but then you're you're you're paying people's wages for a passion project because it's going to"
4750080,4756320," need to get edited and then if we if we make a mistake over there uh the the people that are angry"
4756320,4761680," but are going to cleave all of the other companies and groups that we have which is pretty extensive"
4761680,4768080," at this point um so it's just it's tough it's tough someone on twitch chat talking about that"
4768080,4773680," untitled goose game stream that you and i did saying it was funny to watch like yeah it was but"
4773680,4778400," from like a work standpoint that was the least productive thing that either luke or i could"
4778400,4784480," have been doing yeah well what what were we making like three dollars an hour to play untitled"
4784480,4791520," goose game i have no idea the the opportunity cost of that is enormous yeah enormous"
4791520,4797040," yeah and you know we've got people on twitch also pointing out that you don't have to do"
4797040,4803280," reviews you can do niche content yeah but niche content right in the name how do you make money"
4803280,4808880," on it and there's there's people that can't and and be very successful and make really good money"
4808880,4815440," but it's often one-to-two-bit outfits we're big exactly like that's the thing is is you can make"
4815440,4821440," money as an individual but we're not an individual anymore yeah like all of a sudden anything we do"
4821440,4828240," has to make more than just the person working on it because there are other teams that support"
4828240,4833680," those people if you're just an individual fine but if you have to also pay your share of the overhead"
4833680,4837840," from our accounting department and logistics department and to be clear at you know it's not"
4837840,4845840," fair to call accounting overhead but they don't make money they count it right and what they do is"
4845840,4851600," super important keeping us compliant with various tax regulations and and things like that you know"
4851600,4858960," we can't operate without them but it means that we can't just take every dollar that comes in and"
4858960,4863120," go oh well that covers the salary of the people who work on the show it's just more complicated"
4863120,4867840," and like the the stylactic asks what's the rationale behind carpool critics"
4868480,4876880," uh the rationale there is that they really wanted to do a movie podcast and I said I okay uh give"
4876880,4881760," it a shot and we'll see how it goes and they really really like doing it still I guess because"
4881760,4889600," otherwise they don't have to I mean they're just movies they're just movies podcast yeah and like"
4889600,4895760," for me the the type of content that I would want to make if I made content like that would be content"
4895760,4905840," similar to uh like a hoy or nakey jakey or channels like that and there's no way I would be as good"
4905840,4912880," so you should probably just watch them and I'm just being real about that I would probably I"
4912880,4917920," would probably I think Untitled Goose Game is honestly a perfect sandbox for me that that is my"
4917920,4925040," gaming personality in a nutshell really is uh I probably had the most fun that I've had gaming"
4925040,4931760," in the last like five years playing Star Citizen with you and Riley for his tech longer episode"
4931760,4940480," just being an absolute piece of garbage the entire time like I had way more fun ruining this"
4940480,4944640," utterly broken game for everyone than I would have actually trying to roleplay in it"
4944640,4950320," yeah you know we should we should release that as a float plane exclusive if Riley still has"
4950320,4957600," the uncut footage yeah because that was hilarious it was so fun I I wish it made I don't think it"
4957600,4963120," made it into the cut or maybe maybe like one version of it did or something but Linus figured"
4963120,4970480," out how to how to like KO your character I'm gonna say it that way um and I it was like holding"
4970480,4973760," backspace or something and your character would just knock themselves out and you'd fall on the floor"
4974640,4982240," we started running on the hanger both of us just like launching themselves and just ragdolling in"
4982240,4989120," the middle of this like star port and morphology who's a fantastic creator he's an architect who"
4989120,4994640," does reviews of the ships and stars as he does other stuff as well but he's trying to like show us"
4994640,4998720," this game and how cool it can be able to like run on on boom"
5002560,5010400," I managed to almost almost pk the entire squad yeah yeah no I thought you did get everyone"
5010400,5015520," no I didn't get everyone they got the gun away from me no because you crashed the ship into the"
5015520,5025920," plane oh well yeah I did that yeah I do remember the gun part though yeah oh I was so close to"
5025920,5033360," getting you all yeah I I would have fun I could have some fun making so I've had some video ideas in"
5033360,5040480," my head for like years that I would really like to explore um yeah me too honestly it's the thing"
5040480,5045600," that kind of sucks about doing this professionally because there's video ideas that I would love to"
5045600,5050000," do that have been like swimming around in my head twinkling in the eye you know that are just"
5050960,5057040," not worth the time yeah and it's like what is what is worth you know yeah like there's a there's a"
5057040,5061840," few that I've wanted to do I've even started writing scripts on a few of them over the years and"
5061840,5067840," then just been like this is so this is way too similar to what I do for work releasing this on"
5067840,5073760," my personal channel would probably be really weird I don't like really want to do that so then"
5073760,5079600," they haven't become anything but it's still something that like but then but then if I do it during"
5079600,5084080," work hours the whole time I try to do it I'm just gonna be like holy crap there's other things I"
5084080,5090480," should be doing so I don't know it just doesn't really line up I feel the same way about a lot of"
5090480,5095200," stuff I mean even stuff that I really like kind of should be doing for work like the you know"
5095200,5100880," Colton's been chasing me to do a course forever and like I should write that book and stuff like"
5100880,5106640," that it's just I know it's not the quote unquote best use of my time but there's things that I"
5106640,5114400," kind of feel like would be a lot more creatively fulfilling but just are I you know I think the"
5114400,5122240," big problem is I'm really just not done with LTT yet I feel like once we get labs up and running"
5122240,5130960," smoothly once we have you know like this great host stable and we've got labs just like churning"
5130960,5136560," through product in the background you know maybe the time will come yeah maybe the time will come"
5136560,5143920," for maybe to spend more time fighting Dennis on channel Superfund or something you know yeah maybe"
5143920,5150160," you could have your own I haven't been doing it as much lately because we're we're crunching"
5150160,5156080," pretty hard we're behind on a bunch of things but Flowplane in theory has this thing where the"
5156080,5161760," last Friday of every month except for right now we do something where we do creative day where people"
5161760,5167840," are supposed to work on their own like something that they find interesting that might potentially"
5167840,5172640," be a benefit but we don't measure it based on like benefits and stuff it's just could it potentially"
5172640,5177200," bring any value to the company and there's some been some really cool stuff that is that has come"
5177200,5180400," from that that has actually been really valued there's also been stuff that has come from that that has"
5180400,5187120," had effectively no real major value and that's completely fine but it's a cool creative outlet"
5188640,5192800," so if you're able to have the time to be able to do that but one of the problems with those"
5192800,5202240," types of systems is being able to have that time is is hard so yeah yeah Conrad just pointed out"
5202240,5207280," I had points so merch messages was originally a creative day thing yeah I was uh there was a"
5207280,5213520," suggestion from a viewer I don't remember exactly how detailed it was and then Conrad took it"
5215440,5222560," way further and turned it into merch messages and now that's like a core part of Wancho and a"
5222560,5226720," notable part of the business really really really cool there's been other stuff that has come out"
5226720,5232720," that has been very good from creative day as well and it's something that I want to get back into"
5232720,5239600," or just buy it on some stuff but yeah I think those things can be valuable I think line is having"
5239600,5245360," some time to just riff on things that you find interesting would be cool but time is very leveraged"
5245360,5252640," right now yeah I don't know video game reviews it's something we've been thinking about for years"
5252640,5257600," because before we started Channel Super Fun it was like a which one do we do type of conversation"
5257600,5263760," yeah yeah we've started video games or twazing toys and other more different kinds of games yeah"
5263760,5273520," yeah uh EA speaking of games is shutting down servers for many old but still good games"
5274400,5279520," this was first spotted by true achievements on Monday but electronic arts has confirmed it has"
5279520,5283920," started the process of shutting down online servers for some of their older games which means"
5283920,5290240," players will no longer be able to play multiplayer online and any achievements that require that"
5290240,5297760," feature will be forever unwinnable IGN assembled a list of when and what games are getting shut down"
5298320,5305680," and it is October 20th 2022 army of two the 40th day and army of two the devil's cartel"
5305680,5312880," as well as dragon age origins the multiplayer screenshots server on November 9th 2022 they're"
5312880,5317200," shutting down command and conquer red alert three command and conquer three tiberium wars and"
5317200,5322880," command and conquer three canes wrath alongside mercenaries two world and flames November 30th"
5322880,5329760," sees the end of on rush and january 19th of 2023 we'll see the end of mirrors edge nba jam on fire"
5329760,5339920," edition gatling gears and shank two oh rest in peace I really wish there was legislation to"
5339920,5346960," force these guys to release community server software yeah why not because they are clearly"
5346960,5354160," shutting it down anyway very very frustrating yeah anthony's discussion question not really a"
5354160,5360640," question but bring back dedicated servers you cowards games with servers shut down like this"
5360640,5366400," should have their server software released ab so freaking lutely preach it anthony"
5366400,5372400," yeah I uh I feel the same way there's there's a question which is like adam says"
5374400,5380320," mirrors edges online content only consists of leaderboards and ghost downloads how hard is it"
5380320,5393040," to keep those going yeah unreal extremely frustrating entire generations of gaming experiences will be"
5393040,5404320," lost to this always online multiplayer paradigm it's really quite sad um i've always really"
5404320,5412320," because you you don't like maybe you don't care too much right now about some of these things"
5412320,5417680," closing down maybe you haven't thought about mirrors edge for a while right um"
5419600,5425600," but there's a bunch of games where I don't think about them for a decade and then one day I'll"
5425600,5429920," talk to a buddy about it and we'll reminisce over some good times with some game that I forgot"
5429920,5435120," the name of oh yeah member worms i'm again yeah it's like man we should play worms are again that's"
5435120,5440800," actually really fun and with worms are again you can't and you can have a hoot just fire up some"
5440800,5445840," hamachi and yeah and it's really quite genuinely entertaining it's fun to go back and play that"
5445840,5453360," game some fun parts of it can even be going wow this is a bad game um just figuring out like okay"
5453360,5457680," in the last however many years a lot of good quality life things have happened to gaming like"
5457680,5463120," that part is interesting i'm not saying that with worms or again to be clear but that has been"
5463120,5467200," something that has happened to me a couple of times that i've i've put some roast into glasses"
5467200,5471920," on about a certain game going back to play it and then i'm like oh wow okay usually i think i have"
5471920,5478240," a pretty good memory for that stuff but not all the time but i want to be able to do that um and"
5478240,5485840," i think it's crazy that it's becoming a thing that you can't um and this is something that"
5485840,5490800," we talked about on wancho when it started becoming more popular like games were becoming"
5490800,5495360," always online multiplayer experience blah blah blah blah and no one seemed to care"
5495360,5501280," yeah and now it's starting to happen and i think we're running into a situation where a decent"
5501280,5506240," amount of people don't care and i think the reason why is it hasn't happened to a game that they care"
5506240,5511920," about and it's going to be one of those things where it's like they came for the x and i didn't"
5511920,5516160," care because it didn't affect me they came for the y i didn't care because it didn't affect me now"
5516160,5523040," they're coming for me who's there to care about this i don't remember how that quote works um but"
5523040,5532080," like i i think that's happening you should care this sucks this is bad the the there's groups out there"
5532080,5541440," that try to um preserve old gaming experiences um and i think that's most that matrix online"
5541440,5550960," mmo um like server reverse engineering project was wild yeah i don't think it ever ultimately"
5550960,5557440," succeeded but like with that kind of dedication you have to know that if the source code was released"
5557440,5565360," they would have made it happen yep probably would have made it better yeah um so i don't know this is"
5565360,5570880," sad the the question of what gave me most is going to see offline uh i don't know i'm just"
5570880,5576320," disappointed to see any of them offline i think yeah no none of these games should be offline it"
5576320,5583440," should be only if nobody wants to play it anymore but instead we're not given the option we're not"
5583440,5589440," given the choice yeah and even if no one wants to play it anymore maybe someone wants to play it"
5589440,5595120," further out on the line and and to be clear i don't think"
5595120,5602240," stop looking to the error off camera yeah sorry i'll look at cardboard line is a little bit more"
5602240,5611520," often um i don't think anyone is i don't think that these companies should have to necessarily like"
5611520,5617600," host the online servers for these in perpetuity forever they should do um"
5617600,5624080," what i think someone else mentioned i think anthony or or maybe lydis they should make it so"
5624080,5630800," that other people can if they want um like uh uh thiede in twitch chat says uh battle for just one"
5630800,5634560," game where the community fought hard with the a they actually ended up getting the source code"
5634560,5639040," as long as they swore never to monetize the game and it's a similar situation good enough uh"
5639040,5644160," supreme commander forged alliance exactly good enough we don't want to make money off the ip we"
5644160,5650960," just want to play our freaking game yes forge alliance is i i think it's actually brilliant because"
5650960,5657760," they handed it over to community members that are doing an amazing job the lord's work the forge"
5657760,5664320," alliance team uh it's actually just wild what they've accomplished really really really impressive"
5664320,5670720," and they made an agreement you have to have a legit copy of the game to be able to play"
5670720,5675680," so people still buy it because you can buy it through steam the original company actually"
5675680,5682480," a win win yeah everybody wins sounds good you i'm not even asking you to stop profiting off of it"
5683840,5689600," exactly all i want is for there to be a route and if people don't want to put the effort in if you"
5689600,5695920," have made the path clear if people don't want to put the effort in that's fine but the path needs"
5695920,5703760," to be clear there needs to be a path just shutting it down creating no potential path forward"
5703760,5712240," that's not cool i don't like that at all and i i would really love it if something happened i"
5712240,5716080," don't know if it has to happen legally or what but something happens so that this couldn't happen"
5716080,5721440," anymore because we're we're legitimately losing history and it's not it's not good or cool yeah"
5721440,5727840," so what said ashron's call apparently there's multiple community servers now because you can do"
5727840,5736800," that that's great ashron's call is an ancient mmo um and i i suspect microsoft is not expect that"
5736800,5742000," they're going to be able to make money off of the original ashron's call and that might be a very"
5742000,5748160," accurate thing um but yeah just let the community host some stuff and if you want to put in stuff"
5748160,5754320," hey you can't profit off of this or they have to have official license keys for the software to be"
5754320,5759680," able to play on your server whatever sure whatever just make it possible"
5762960,5769440," or or alternate solution you can just get rich enough to buy these companies outright"
5769440,5779760," like kanye west a claimed rapper yee is buying social media platform parlor after being banned"
5779760,5785040," from instagram and twitter for making uh what were i haven't actually seen them but what were"
5785040,5792080," apparently anti-semitic comments kanye west now legally known as yee i actually didn't know he"
5792080,5797840," legally changed his name either yee that's a thing um has decided to take matters into his own hands"
5797840,5804960," by purchasing parlor in a tuesday press release parent company carlamon technologies i don't know"
5804960,5810720," how you're supposed to pronounce that parlor meant uh announced it agrees to be sold to yee"
5810720,5816640," in the same release yee said in a world where conservative opinions are considered to be"
5816640,5821600," controversial we have to make sure they have the right to freely uh we have the right to freely"
5821600,5829200," express ourselves ceo george farmer said this deal will change the world and change the way the world"
5829200,5835040," thinks about free speech yee is making a groundbreaking move into the free speech media space and will"
5835040,5841840," never have to fear being removed from social media again parlamant then docked numerous verified"
5841840,5849920," users and investors by ceo seeing instead of bcc the announcement apparently it's yay not yee"
5849920,5862640," is it yay uh oh really wait so it's yay right but they're called yeezys what they would be yeezys"
5862640,5872480," they're yeezys i'm concerned we're getting trolled it's yay like con yay yeah that's what i thought"
5872480,5878880," yay it's yay then so they're yeezys oh wait that's not what i thought con yee"
5878880,5889440," con yee weast there is some conjecture that yay all right sorry might be getting played for a sucker"
5889440,5897680," by parlamant parlamant technologies tech dirt noted that parlor has around 50,000 daily active users"
5897680,5904240," and that the twitter for people removed from twitter it has the limited audience that is now split"
5904240,5910320," between multiple social networks like parlor and truth social uh they have apparently been trying"
5910320,5917680," to offload parlor for some time but have demanded very high prices uh yay has recently garnered"
5917680,5923040," controversy after being spotted wearing a white lides matter shirt and going on tirades on social"
5923040,5929680," media and making false statements regarding george floyd's death along with other rants"
5929680,5935600," uh there are some discussion questions here but frankly i don't think we're going to get into"
5935600,5941040," any of them discussion question a what is a free speech media platform?"
5942320,5950240," discussion question b are you a yay stan or a hater? c would you ever invest in a social"
5950240,5957120," media platform which one? and oh actually d's pretty good this is from james"
5957120,5964000," doesn't yay know that elon plans to pardon most twitter bans and bring back trump which would"
5964000,5970240," leave how many people on parlor i'm thinking a big fat less than the 50,000 they have today"
5971200,5976560," apparently uh elon also plans to drop like i think it's like two-thirds of the twitter staff or"
5976560,5981840," something like that i thought it was three quarters three quarters wow so uh given actually you know"
5981840,5989040," what hold on a second if he actually does that and actually just like slashes the entire content"
5989040,5995440," moderation staff and twitter turns into an even more toxic cesspool than it is today nice it might"
5995440,6000000," be a really good time to own parlor and be an alternative to it"
6000000,6011360," yeah really fun one uh i don't maybe you mentioned this and i just didn't hear it but uh par"
6011360,6017360," lament part part i don't know whatever the the parent company uh docked numerous verified users"
6017360,6023840," and investors by ce seeing them instead of bccing the announcement yeah that's great that is that"
6023840,6028720," is an a plus um we run a tech company move right there yeah"
6028720,6043440," she's yeah i uh i don't have too much to say about this other than hey plants need water and"
6043440,6051600," float plane chat obama made my frogs gay too let's move on uh better pixels there's a report claiming"

6065760,6071520," the company including cuts to divisions focused on software for non-google devices and more resources"
6071520,6076560," for google's first party hardware divisions why well apparently google views apple is more of a"
6076560,6082560," threat than it has previously sam san is apparently in decline in many established markets and apple"

6112960,6119440," heck apparently sam san one plus and jao me are being singled out as premium android partners but"
6119440,6125360," many other manufacturers may not get the same attention the discussion question here is what"
6125360,6129840," effectful google abandoning other android partners have in the long run i would say not good ones"
6129840,6134640," because one of the biggest perceived problems with android is the lack of long-term software support"
6134640,6140720," and b is it wise for google to switch to a more apple-like model if you'd asked me five years ago"
6140720,6147200," six seven years ago in the next six days i'd have said yes it's extremely wise for google to go"
6147200,6152480," more vertically integrated if you asked me today i would say that sounds like a terrible idea"
6153280,6161760," um they have proven time and time again that they just can't handle it um for lack of a better way"
6161760,6174400," of putting that yeah yeah i don't know i in my opinion the quality level of a lot of google's"
6174400,6183840," hardware was best when they didn't make it uh likes like the nexus devices sorry i just kicked"
6183840,6192000," you um the nexus devices oh there you go there you go um the nexus devices were sweet the pixel"
6192000,6197840," devices almost immediately started to go have had their ups and downs a little bit downhill yeah"
6197840,6202000," um i don't remember a nexus device not being good though"
6202800,6211360," i mean they weren't perfect they were no but they were cheap yeah they were really great for how cheap"
6211360,6216720," they were um but so if you go in not expecting them to be the absolute best thing on the market"
6216720,6222560," uh but to very likely be the best thing in that price segment they were really good um"
6222560,6228000," i don't know as as a as a pixel person i have been disappointed over the last few years"
6228640,6238400," um more than few years i guess yeah i'm not too surprised i we've been hearing for quite a while"
6238400,6242000," about how apples market share has been increasing increasing increasing you wonder who they're"
6242000,6248480," taking that from it's like well probably probably a no phone that's for sure yeah exactly"
6248480,6257680," so yeah yeah i don't i think it's time for us to get to some merch messages what do you think"
6257680,6260800," turn let's do it okay that sounds good to me"
6260800,6270000," hit it then i'm gonna get there um okay this is from garard uh Linus Ubisoft sent out an email"
6270000,6276240," today that they are uh bringing an o 1800 consoles and are having people try it out are you going to"
6276240,6282320," try an o 1800 on a console uh yeah well i'm at it i'm gonna play some warcrafts too on PlayStation"
6282320,6291200," 1 excellent technically a thing that you can do it sounds like a very very stupid yeah i feel like"
6291200,6297920," you should really play it on a computer uh yeah wow i feel like it would be i mean i'm glad that the"
6297920,6303840," i'm glad the franchise is getting this kind of support from ooby soft i'm glad that it's"
6303840,6309520," successful it's it really is a very different gaming experience than almost any other quote-unquote"
6309520,6315840," rts um it's a really cool game yeah i don't see why it needs to be on console it already runs"
6315840,6321440," really well on pc you can run it on like integrated intel graphics um if anything it's poorly optimized"
6321440,6326560," for high-end hardware but it does really well on low-end hardware like low details i i don't see"
6326560,6333040," why this needs to be on on console i think playing high difficulty ano on console will be really hard"
6333040,6339040," um yes just with how fast you can get things done because a lot of at a lot of times you're"
6339040,6343760," kind of fighting against the clock in that game um yeah you got to make decisions quickly and you"
6343760,6348960," have to make them very well you have to do react to emergencies everything's on fire you know that"
6348960,6353920," kind of thing pirates are coming like there's there's stuff going on you have to react really fast"
6353920,6359120," hopefully they do a really good job of it um because more fans of ano would be more cool"
6359120,6366320," but yeah it sounds really tough con red says uh starcraft 64 it's good example yeah maybe maybe"
6366320,6371680," not uh this one's from tyler uh hey liness what are your next plans for your smart home i have"
6371680,6376080," been following your journey and using it to avoid issues you had or take ideas that worked well"
6376080,6383840," oh well one of the things i really need to figure out is what switches uh in a value is"
6383840,6389600," apparently still working on their motion sensing switch so hopefully that'll come sometime in the"
6389600,6396000," new year and i can replace those uh g_e_ jasco ones uh jasco did ultimately do the right thing"
6396000,6401920," in release firmware updates but i'm still having a lot of just general bugginess with them so i"
6401920,6406880," would like to just wholesale replace them at this point and it of lee's new upcoming switch uses"
6406880,6412320," millimeter wave for presence detection which is apparently a lot more accurate than motion sensing"
6412320,6423200," so with that swap out done i think that the next goal would be motion sensing and timed light"
6423200,6428880," intensity throughout the house because right now it's like you're it's cool to walk around"
6428880,6432960," and all futuristic like lights just magically turn on as you're walking around the house but the"
6432960,6438160," brightness is almost never correct so you end up touching the lights which a lot anyway and it would"
6438160,6444560," be really nice to be able to schedule that kind of stuff um i'd say that's the next big one also"
6444560,6450240," i still have not even touched those ecobies that are alongside the american standard thermostats"
6450240,6455600," in all the locations so i'm going to need to figure out now that it's getting chilly for the winter"
6455600,6460880," how to make sure that the heat and the cool are not fighting with each other so that's going to be"
6460880,6467680," a project for jake realistically but um i will have to assign it to jake so that's my role"
6467680,6473040," uh so what pointed out you can plug in keyboard and mouse to consoles these days"
6473040,6479440," i don't know how many people do that i suspect it's very uh common i'd be really interested in"
6479440,6486080," to know how yeah yeah it sounds like a good video for your new gaming channel"
6486080,6491680," maybe not maybe not how do you poll those people though because it's not going to be it's not going"
6491680,6496960," to be like putting up a poll on fopelain chat is is not going to accurately answer that question"
6496960,6504400," at all now that we know that 15 percent of them lie yeah um but but but even then like you're you're"
6504400,6509920," pulling the wrong group of people um you'd need a wider group of non-technical people to get a"
6509920,6514800," more accurate answer on how many people are going to pop in the keyboard and mouse dang zing wow"
6514800,6525600," what did you just call console people non-technical people no hot take hot take luke i didn't"
6525600,6533680," i was i was saying that we have a concentrated audience of technical people here and yeah and"
6533680,6538240," to find out how people game on console you'd have to ask non-technical people to find out how"
6538240,6542640," people game on we find out how people game on computers you'd have to do the same thing because"
6542640,6549920," if you pulled the flip line if you if you pulled the flip line no you're canceled if you pull honestly"
6549920,6553920," console players are probably less technical than computer players that just wasn't my point"
6554880,6559520," we did it a second time this is so good this isn't my point i uh the"
6559520,6566240," minus if you want to pay console gamers if you wanted to figure out the resolution of monitors"
6566240,6570320," that people had on steam and you pulled the flip plane audience it's going to be wrong"
6570320,6575280," because you have to find the delays no the delays over chats exploding"
6575280,6583360," the average steam user which is not the average person in flip plane chat it's a problem the"
6583360,6589200," sample size is is wrong and you're also saying that they have lower IQs as well oh my goodness"
6589200,6602880," and they're and they're ugly you got to stop texting me this stuff off the show you can't"
6602880,6608000," you're just adding fuel to this fire i can't and their mums are ugly well i mean that makes"
6608000,6611520," sense i mean if they're ugly their mums are probably ugly like it's got to come from somewhere"
6613040,6617760," shall we move on before this becomes an issue we don't want to be trending on twitter again"
6617760,6624480," yeah uh this is this one's from eon good evening guys love the channel and all you do my wife"
6624480,6631200," and i are expecting our first can't wait to play space kids in DOSBox with a little one in my lap"
6631200,6636240," just like my dad did with me what gaming memories do you have and want to share recreate with your"
6636240,6642320," own kids you know what i actually went through this pretty recently there's this um i think it's"
6642320,6651040," called pc emu pc pcm it's a pc emulator and it allows you to actually emulate like a windows 95"
6651040,6659920," windows 98 older era cpu on a modern computer and it's one of the only ways to play old like point"
6659920,6665040," and click adventure games from that time and one of the games that my kids actually had a blast"
6665040,6672720," playing is called mixed up mother goose and game experiences like that simply do not exist anymore"
6672720,6679920," i think they're just kind of considered too low-five for today and it was a it was a really uh it was"
6679920,6686640," really cool seeing them play and enjoy the exact games that you know i was playing back in like"
6686640,6693360," 1993 or whatever back back when that came out um there's actually a lot of those kinds of games"
6693360,6700400," that was how at least two of my siblings learned to read was these interactive uh computer like"
6700400,6705680," books um the george shrinks was one of the ones that we had and there's a paper copy of it obviously"
6705680,6709920," but we we also had the digital one that would read it to you and you could kind of interact with the"
6709920,6715040," illustrations on the pages um yeah i think that's uh"
6715040,6721840," that's one that i was able to successfully share and recreate but i think that you know"
6722800,6727200," in line with what we were talking about earlier on the show that may not be an option for kids"
6727200,6732960," that are growing up today their gaming experiences might be not irretrievable"
6732960,6742960," yeah i mean what gaming memories do you have something that i really deeply enjoyed was"
6742960,6750400," morrowind talking about morrowind a lot i know uh morrowind was a game that my dad my dad and i"
6750400,6754240," played a lot no one else like my brother didn't really care he wasn't that into it but my dad and"
6754240,6760160," i played a bunch and um i've told the story before but i didn't realize that i had never actually"
6760160,6766480," started the main quest until we were like we never bought a player's guide before um but the internet"
6766480,6771360," was in its infancy still there were expensive man and they were expensive i never bought one and"
6771360,6776800," it's still the only game i've ever bought one for um but i don't know what really compelled us to do"
6776800,6781200," it but at one point we were just like there's clearly a lot to this game we're clearly missing"
6781200,6786400," a ton let's check out a player's guide and we did and we got one uh and then immediately"
6786400,6791360," figured out that there was a main quest and we just had no idea it existed because you could sell"
6791360,6797120," the item that started the main quest so i just sell it every time i don't need this thing um"
6797120,6805680," and that turned into my dad and i like playing morrowind co-op style"
6805680,6809360," where one of us would be piloting the character and we'd trade back and forth all the time it wasn't"
6809360,6814560," like just me all the time or anything um one of us would be piloting the character and the other one"
6814560,6819440," would be reading from the player's guide and figuring out like what should we go do next and the player's"
6819440,6826160," guide was written in a really really cool way um like it it was genuinely really well written"
6826160,6832240," where they would keep spoilers out of things and they would keep context and information at the end"
6832240,6837520," of what they were talking about um and they they communicated that to you at the beginning of the"
6837520,6843440," player's guide so they made it very clear that like there's gonna if if if you're looking up like"
6843440,6849600," you can use it in a way that if you see some cave or or if you read through the player's guide"
6849600,6853360," and it's like oh there's a cave here and you didn't know that was there or something you could use"
6853360,6858320," it to get you there and then you could explore it on your own and then you could check with the"
6858320,6862160," player's guide to make sure you got everything so it may it tried to make it so that you were"
6862160,6866000," still exploring the world on your own but you could use the player's guide to make sure that"
6866000,6872880," you weren't missing entire whole experiences like the whole main quest um and my dad and I playing"
6872880,6878480," Morrowind is is probably one of if not genuinely my favorite memory of gaming but i that's not"
6878480,6883120," gonna share that if i had a child i'm not gonna share that with my child it's it's not gonna be"
6883120,6891680," the same way um so i don't know i have no idea okay let's have a look this one's from ryan"
6891680,6897840," hi Linus did you test iops on the one million dollar server also will we ever be able to buy your"
6897840,6903280," blanks i prefer plain teas and quality ones are hard to find especially in non-blanned colors"
6903280,6910800," well now that i only shoot blanks i'd say that uh should be pretty easy to get one if you really"
6910800,6918960," want okay sorry i'm sure you meant to create as a piece of cardboard isn't it it is it's challenging"
6918960,6928080," your best could make paper babies um yes we do plan to make the blanks available i think that"
6928080,6933520," our costs have actually gone up on t-shirts we've stubbornly maintained them at"
6933520,6938640," 1999 throughout all of the price increases that have gone on over the last five years"
6939440,6946560," so what i think will happen is we will continue selling our printed teas at 1999 but we are going"
6946560,6952160," to absorb some of that additional cost by also selling the blank teas at the same price which i"
6952160,6958880," think is a perfectly good price for a quality shirt like the one that we have finally finally found"
6958880,6967680," um and made so it's going to not really yield any kind of savings for you but yes you will be"
6967680,6972880," able to buy a blank tea and it'll just be all all different colors i think actually they're"
6972880,6979040," gonna sell really really well because they're great shirts and not everybody wants like a tech"
6979040,6986160," picture or slogan on their shirt um so especially on weekends actually i often reach for my blank"
6986160,6991120," because i just don't want to walk around like and have be even more recognizable than i was"
6993200,6999840," so 1999 is here to stay also oh actually actually i just realized we never addressed this a lot of"
6999840,7005520," people asked if floatplane is planning to increase pricing in light of you know Netflix cracking"
7005520,7012560," down on multi-users youtube increasing pricing for premium the answer is no at our scale we have"
7012560,7018560," not felt the need to do anything like that and especially as long as the platform is growing"
7018560,7022880," like that's one of the things that i actually addressed in the youtube should charge for 4k video"
7022880,7029200," is that the issue is that the proliferation of content has outpaced membership growth"
7029200,7035680," but floatplane has actually seen a huge surge in membership recently between the colony chris"
7035680,7040480," collab the really great behind the scenes content that we've been doing the better image quality"
7040480,7045600," and the fact that wancho was missing for a few hours last week apparently drove about 500 of"
7045600,7051200," you to sign up for floatplane which is hilarious gotta get that fix um but floatplane is growing"
7051200,7057200," like crazy right now to the point where it's like you know dang why aren't there more creators on"
7057200,7062480," floatplane i don't understand it it's like actually a really good it's really good but whatever i"
7062480,7070720," can't i can only make the horse to water i can't make it drink yeah oh yeah okay i got another one"
7070720,7078880," here from anonymous how's daily driving the new air pod pros oh they're great uh if anything the"
7078880,7084800," active noise cancellation is too good i used to be able to like at least hear my kids if they really"
7084800,7092640," needed my attention and now i just really can't when i just have them in a noise cancelling so it's"
7092640,7097760," blissful actually and they're even better for sleeping than the old ones then i'm super happy"
7097760,7102800," with them so far i hope they don't develop the same driver rattle that my previous like two pairs"
7102800,7109760," of air pods pro ones did i mean that's always a possibility i guess this one's from louis my"
7109760,7117360," brother wants to know if you would consider making a cologne yeah we're gonna call it gamer sweat"
7117360,7122240," it's coming next year i i'm kidding it's not happening luke i see the look on your face okay"
7122240,7132160," i'm disappointed liness um i don't know like we could but it's it's one of those it always comes"
7132160,7136560," down to that question that i always talk about what are we contributing to add"
7136560,7143760," yeah what value are we adding here that are there not enough smells to choose from is there not"
7143760,7150720," enough toilet water in the world i just i mean you could take that same approach to t-shirts and"
7150720,7156560," things like that you know well no i think our t-shirts actually have a reason for existing you"
7156560,7161760," know i like that like the commenter said it's actually really hard to find a decent quality"
7161760,7166960," shirt that doesn't suck that's fair i've been violently impressed with all your merchandise"
7166960,7172080," yeah there's there's me being a corpochial but no it's it's surprising how good quality it is"
7172080,7179040," well the thing is that it's surprising how much how little it costs to make something good"
7179040,7184320," like you can make something crap for six dollars and you can make something really good for seven"
7184320,7189360," dollars and fifty cents and people work the six dollars all the time it's great it is amazing"
7189360,7196240," how often people choose the six dollar option it drives me crazy it shouldn't be a business model"
7196240,7202080," that let makes you stand out to spend the extra dollar fifty to make it twice as good like i just"
7202080,7211200," don't get it but here we are yeah so it's very strange it makes me feel bad for uh having bought"
7211200,7217040," things before and then just being bad you should make i would do it before i would do it before i"
7217040,7223280," would do cologne you should make gamified deodorant that'd be cool like you have to wear it every day"
7223280,7229040," or you like lose point or some somehow somehow yeah so it has to like the lid has to come off"
7229040,7234080," every day or something um smart deodorant and if it doesn't they're just gonna bought that you're"
7234080,7240640," you know you're not gonna win like a ruined scape deodorant uh here's one from daniel"
7240640,7247440," linus anthony is hold on anthony is suggesting sense for the uh for the cologne or deodorant"
7247440,7255200," we've got new electronics magic smoke dusting day chiller coolant and uh rtx 2080 ti foam"
7255200,7261920," acting foam i want i want one that smells like exploded capacitors you know that burned electronics"
7261920,7268400," smell yeah magic smoke magic smoke smell yeah exactly yeah i would definitely wear that um"
7268400,7276000," anyway yeah i mean make that make it as a joke uh linus have you ever felt limited by not having a"
7276000,7284800," college degree related to tech what if what if you did what if you did uh like a lt t store discount"
7284800,7289360," if you actually and we'd have to find some way to track it and i don't necessarily know how but"
7289360,7293200," you get like an lt t store discount or like a free full plane subscription or something"
7293200,7299600," if you if you actually use the deodorant you talk about iot internet of things deodorant"
7299600,7304880," so there's a whole thing just getting yours to actually wear it because that that's that's the"
7304880,7309440," problem right no no that's easy because you would just make the deodorant a subscription"
7309440,7314960," and if they cancel this if they have the subscription they are they're either using it"
7314960,7320720," or they are accumulating so pius and i have to be odorant and i know a lot i know a lot of nerds"
7320720,7326160," and geeks and i think that we're all about min maxing right guys yeah you know so i don't think"
7326160,7331840," it's min maxing to accumulate piles of deodorant so yeah if you're going to buy it i think you'll"
7331840,7336880," i think you'll use it i think you'll use it if you're going to get it in the mail anyway so that"
7336880,7342400," could work that could work we just have a subscription service for deodorant oh we uh Conrad Conrad"
7342400,7347760," just said in the very bottom under all the pastes there's a generated discount code genius yes"
7347760,7354080," that's pretty good because yeah you could you could be a butt and you could like cut it off"
