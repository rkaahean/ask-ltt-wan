15300,20420," Okay here in the Wanshow document all right I figured hey, it's a good title for the video"
20420,26280," So let's lean into it and hopefully a short king is not something really insulting. I don't think it is"
26560,33840," In other news this week Microsoft and Google have laid off thousands of workers again"

104160,110320," So at this point in time I literally know less about that than any of you do because I couldn't read that"
110320,115160," No, any what it is. I've been told I'm not allowed to read a certain part of the doc"
115160,119360," All I know is there's a wheel and it's of pain. It's of pain. Yeah. No, no"

213240,216160," Five six. Yes, that is true. It's it"
216160,222760," Yes, yes, that is true. Come on. I'm not gonna lie about it. Are you do you get asked here?"
222760,230880," Does it give you an S tier? I think he's great. He's funny. Oh, that's not he's niche. That's true. That's true. That's true. You're niche"
230880,236880," Okay, they'd be like what the stop. Let's let's put him in let's put him in"
236880,238320," Let's throw him a B"
238320,242360," I don't know if B makes you a king. Well, hold on a second. Hold on a second. Wait a second"
242360,246240," Wait a second was that Tom Holland next to me on in on B shell?"
246240,251640," Okay, because I don't even feel bad at that point. Hold on. Who else are looking at here?"
251640,254640," Hold on. That's markiplier"
254640,260840," That's Tom Holland. All right. All right. Okay. You're doing pretty good. All right, so that's a strong B"
260840,262600," That's a strong B. That's a strong B"
262880,271200," What the hell makes you an a on this list? It's it's gonna be pretty intense. I think what what's in what's an a?"
271200,277880," Who's an a tier king? Hold on a second here. Okay, let's just wait till they zoom in on the thing jump in the end"
277880,282520," Yeah, yeah, I want I just want to see that board. Talk. Show me the board. I want to see the board"
282520,287200," Where's the board at? Oh my god. It is hard to find because it's quite short"
287200,290400," You piece of shit"
290400,299120," You know, you're not allowed to make those jokes, you know, that's how that works, right?"
299120,304960," Got him. Oh, see that's real insecure"
304960,307840," Spencer here with the half inch"
307840,312880," Okay for my metric friends out there a half inch is not a lot"
312880,318480," It's not worth it. It's not it's not worth it. It makes you seem insecure"
318720,321280," If you have to put the half inch in you"
321280,326240," I wouldn't recommend it"
326240,328720," Okay"
328720,334160," Can they can they show I want to zoom in on the board? Oh my god"
334160,338160," There's a tier above a though. There's s tier. They don't zoom into the board"
338160,343520," I can zoom myself. Okay Danny DeVito wait"
345040,348160," Little that's a fictional character"
348160,353920," Okay, I don't recognize any of these other people. It's a little blurry. Okay. Who's my a tier?"
353920,357920," Some soccer player mega man's in there"
357920,365120," Okay, what is this Jesus with a trimmed beard? Okay. I don't know. I don't know who any of these people are you know what?"
365120,369760," I am. I'm pretty happy. I got elmer fud up in here"
370480,374320," B tier looks strong. Yeah, B tier legitimately looks strong. B tier seems like"
374320,379840," Honestly, I feel like the a and the s tier. They were mostly just memeing except Danny DeVito who is amazing"
379840,383840," Yes, and and B tier is like kind of where the solid short came"
383840,389120," So apparently jack black was an s tier. Oh jack black was an s I mean all right messy is up there"
389120,394720," I don't someone said lost to messy, but they didn't say if it was a or s but either way, all right"
394720,399760," Yeah, that's fine. I'm happy with lord far. Apparently you beat tom cruise. I beat tom cruise"
400240,406720," That's pretty good. I mean that's pretty good. Sort of it really strong be it really depends on how you're ranking tom cruise"
406720,410400," If you rank tom cruise as a successful movie producer"
410400,417840," Um then he probably belongs in s tier. Yes, if you rank tom cruise as also s tier as a runner"
417840,419920," Yeah, I mean i've seen him run on a broken ankle"
419920,426160," For real though like he like broke his ankle doing a stun and then just kept running which is like"
426160,429680," He's actually extremely good at running like genuinely. Yeah"
430240,435600," But if you rank tom cruise as an individual with both hinges attached to the wall"
435600,442880," Sometimes when you're extremely excessively good at something other things kind of"
442880,446560," Fall off a little bit. I mean that's one way of talking about it"
446560,448000," Um"
448000,451920," Either way, I'm I'm happy with my B tier ranking and we can move on now"
451920,455120," Maybe we'll get on the spaceship"
455360,456960," In worse news"
456960,462080," Microsoft and google have laid off thousands of workers and this is not"
462080,467840," No, this is not deja vu. You are not watching an old land show from a few weeks ago"
467840,476640," This is like this is like again. This is still happening. The tech sector is shedding workers like there is absolutely no tomorrow"
476640,482320," Uh, microsoft announced is is cutting 10 000 jobs. That's nearly 5% of its workers"
482720,486640," These stated reasons include changes in consumer preferences"
486640,490560," And macro economic conditions"
490560,493600," Um while microsoft is cutting jobs in some areas though"
493600,497360," They are actually still hiring in others notably in the ai department"
497360,502560," I mean we've talked about this a fair bit over the last couple of months, but gpt3"
502560,505040," Um the upcoming gpt4"
505040,509680," Microsoft's major investment in open ai seems to indicate that they are"
510800,517280," Laser focused on what chatbots mean for their future business whether it's as your"
517280,526000," Whether it's bing whether it's windows. I think we're going to see extremely deep integration of the stuff that that microsoft has openly"
526000,530160," Showing that they care about on the consumer side of things for the last very long time"
530160,532560," Cortana bing"
532560,540000," Other things like that would be aided very heavily by the popular thing in ai right now, which is large language models"
540320,544880," Um, so improved versions of that would be extremely valuable to microsoft so it makes sense"
544880,550480," Interestingly microsoft announced the layoffs on january 18th one year to the day"
550480,555920," After they announced their plans to acquire act vision blizzard for 69 billion dollars"
555920,562480," And one week after reports indicated the company plans to invest 10 billion in open ai"
562480,568720," So they have money interesting they have just chosen not to spend it on"
570000,574160," Retaining workers so I don't have notes for this so i'm going to say things that are wrong"
574160,577600," I'm just prefacing a nice like that. We liked you better last week"
577600,582000," But I just couldn't talk at least you didn't say anything inaccurate"
582000,585520," Um as far as I know"
585520,586320," once"
586320,590080," Uh open ai makes enough money that they can pay back whatever"
590080,595680," Like the microsoft's investment you mean yeah, the like shares are gone and everything kind of reverts back to"
596240,601680," Uh being owned and operated under open ai so I wonder if this 10 billion dollar investment"
601680,604320," Is to try to stave that off"
604320,606240," Oh"
606240,610560," I actually I I have no way of knowing clue the terms of no clue"
610560,612640," I don't remember what the terms were"
612640,616880," blah blah blah blah but I feel like this might be kind of like a defensive maneuver because they see them"
616880,623280," Potentially doing too well too fast. So they need to up their investment potentially. I don't know maybe I know nothing"
624000,625360," Moving on"
625360,630800," Meanwhile google is cutting 12 000 employees or around 6 of its workforce"
630800,635040," Google's ceo stated that following two years of dramatic growth google"
635040,645280," Hired for a different economic reality than the one they are currently facing over the course of the pandemic google's workforce increased by 78 000 jobs"
645280,648880," I mean"
650800,656400," I don't know man see this is the thing that's so frustrating to me is when management gets it right"
656400,658960," management benefits"
658960,660960," And when management gets it wrong"
660960,669440," At most companies the employees get hit yeah, so I mean we've talked a lot about"
669440,671520," sustainable hiring"
671520,676800," Um, I I think I've talked about this on wancho before but basically the the way that"
677200,684480," Yvonne and I forecast when we sit down and we set a budget for hiring is we look at the previous year"
684480,687200," and basically go okay"
687200,693120," Assuming no growth whatsoever next year based on that year"
693120,699920," So we we basically build in that we could revert back to last year's performance and not grow at all"
699920,702240," Can we afford?"
702240,707040," Whatever it is that we're hiring for the for for this year is what was that clear"
707440,714960," So our hiring budget for this year is affected by how we performed last year and assuming that the following year will be like that"
714960,717760," What has actually happened is for"
717760,725360," eight out of our 10 years we have experienced significant growth for two out of our 10 years"
725360,728080," We've had what we've kind of called reinvestment years"
728080,735280," um, and that's a big part of the reason that we take that approach is because it gives us the flexibility to have a"
735920,743280," A reinvestment year where we can make long-term investments that might not pay off for two years or or three years"
743280,748160," Um, well, I'm expecting this year that we're in right now to be what we would call a"
748160,754800," Reinvestment year. I'm not expecting well actually we're forecasting less profit this year than last year"
754800,760720," Uh for any, uh"
760800,766400," Line of media group float plane or creator warehouse, um and plays who are watching that's okay. Yeah, yeah"
766400,770080," It will pay off in 2024 to be fine. Everything's good"
770080,775760," And uh, and if it didn't we'd still be able to afford it because it's all kind of based on how last year went"
775760,777680," uh, any who"
777680,783120," Uh, it I don't know it's it's frustrating to me because this feels like such a management failure"
783120,785360," And yet I pretty much promise"
786000,789920," That google's stock went up this week like here. I don't actually know"
789920,795760," I don't actually know response stock does go up in these situations. Uh, do I have google arm? I think oh?"
795760,800960," No, oh wait. Yes google stock is up like 5% today"
800960,804160," Genius, um"
804160,807600," Investors like it when a bunch of people get fired"
807600,810400," Yeah, which I"
811200,819840," I don't know here's a here's an alternate way of looking at it should investors like it when management is so incompetent that they accidentally hire"
819840,822400," 12,000 too many people"
822400,828560," That they then can't afford to pay and presumably"
828560,838160," Whose projects whatever it is that they're working on are now stalled like I I just I don't understand this way of thinking and it's it's frustrating"
839280,844880," Yeah, Ben Mitchell and floatplane chat says google stock went up 5% when they fired 5% of their employees"
844880,847280," maybe"
847280,850640," If they want the stock to go up a hundred percent just fire everybody"
850640,854800," Including cook okay. I'm gonna buy some google real quick here"
854800,862640," On that excuse me on that subject. I actually have some more details to share on my next"
862640,868880," investment that um is now final the wire has gone through they have effectively"
869200,870880," Deposited the funds they've cashed the check"
870880,873600," Um, I'll tell you guys a little bit more about it, but first"
873600,876000," Uh, let's talk through the rest of this google stuff"
876000,882400," So affected employees from google will receive 60 days of pay followed by at least 16 weeks of severance"
882400,885040," I mean you got it at least give them credit there"
885040,890880," That is a pretty decent severance package like if I had 16 weeks of severance is like"
890880,894560," Yeah, if I had six months to kind of figure out what i'm gonna do next"
896160,902160," Fashion place will receive 60 days pay followed by at least 16 weeks severance. What's the difference here?"
902160,905200," I'm not sure. I'm sure there's some distinction like legally"
905200,906800," um"
906800,912640," But like microsoft google's ai department is unaffected and the speculation here is"
912640,916960," Likely because of the threat that chat gpd poses to google's dominance honestly"
916960,923520," Asking chat gpt things is so much better than googling them. You do have to"
924640,927840," I know you know this. I know it's an old data set old data set"
927840,931360," It's an old data set and you have to remember that it will confidently be wrong"
931360,935520," Um, so you have to keep your mind about you, but it it is"
935520,942560," Oh, yeah google search results can be confidently wrong too. Absolutely. That's the thing. Yeah, here's the challenge though"
942560,946560," I read a really interesting article a while back. I really I wish I had it in front of me"
946560,949920," So I could give you guys a more accurate summary of it"
950000,955280," But essentially it made the argument that voice assistance as we know them are doomed"
955280,956880," They're going away"
956880,963520," The the model was supposed to be that by collecting all of this information building these natural language models"
963520,967600," And making these voice assistance ubiquitous in our lives either"
967600,975360," in the phones in our pockets or in the smart speakers in our kitchens or wherever else they happen to be found in our TVs"
976400,979200," They would somehow start to sell us things"
979200,986720," And therefore generate a value to advertisers generating a value to the companies who have built them as far as anyone can tell"
986720,989520," Cortana's gone"
989520,991520," Alexa seems to be losing"
991520,997200," Copious amounts of money. The whole experiment has fundamentally failed"
997200,999840," and what I wonder"
999840,1002960," Is was the problem that they weren't good enough?"
1004240,1009520," Yes, that was part of it. At least part of it. They are fairly crap"
1009520,1012400," Or"
1012400,1019920," Was the problem that people will simply not interact with someone who is constantly trying to sell them something?"
1019920,1022400," So what I'm trying to say is"
1022400,1029840," Is chat GPT going to only be a viable alternative to google searching?"
1030640,1037360," Until it starts trying to sell us crap and if it paid service if it can't successfully sell us crap"
1037360,1039840," then will it ultimately just"
1039840,1045360," Not find a way of being commercialized because like if you think about it"
1045360,1049040," I don't mind looking up information"
1049040,1059040," By myself and being bombarded with ads. It's just kind of part of the process whether I am seeking out information in a newspaper or tv or or"
1059760,1061440," on a webpage"
1061440,1063440," but"
1063440,1067520," And maybe I'm maybe I'm outing myself as a bit of an introvert here"
1067520,1069520," if I have to"
1069520,1071520," communicate with someone"
1071520,1073760," and be sold something"
1073760,1075040," I like"
1075040,1077280," I would rather just buy nothing and walk away"
1077280,1078720," like"
1078720,1084400," There's certain types of purchase experiences that I I just like I read them"
1086240,1089760," like I was I was thinking hey, I have not"
1089760,1097840," Adorned my wife with any precious metals or jewels in a solid seven to eight years"
1097840,1100880," Maybe we're due"
1100880,1103280," I should probably take her jewelry shopping"
1103280,1107600," And I just meant you ever gone like jewelry shopping them all"
1107600,1114320," They're like they're like hyenas. I hate it. They're they're so aggressive. Yeah"
1114960,1121120," You tell them no, I I'm just browsing for now like I will even my body language is completely closed"
1121120,1128560," I I will preemptively before they even get a chance to inhale to open their mouths and start talking to me"
1128560,1130560," I'll say I'm just browsing for now. Thank you"
1130560,1133440," and they hover"
1133440,1138320," they hover they're practically breathing down your neck and and it drives me crazy because"
1139440,1142080," Maybe I'm about to prove myself wrong, right?"
1142080,1146320," It drives me crazy because they wouldn't do it if it didn't work on somebody"
1146320,1147280," Oh, yeah"
1147280,1156560," But if if if the more natural you make the interaction for me with this chatbot or with this voice assistant or whatever it is"
1156560,1159520," I feel like the more personally"
1159520,1164960," Offended or bothered or attacked or whatever the word is the more personally"
1165600,1173040," Anxious I'm gonna be when they try to sell me something ultimately. Does that does that make sense? Are my way off base here?"
1173040,1175920," No, that makes sense. I just I think"
1175920,1182560," And uh, I'm I'm probably going to be wrong and they're probably gonna go with a different model and that will"
1182560,1184720," be super bad"
1184720,1189360," Um, but I'm really hoping they go for a prosumer type of approach"
1189360,1192480," and charge for it"
1195120,1199760," Not if it's Microsoft. I mean Microsoft doesn't even charge for windows anymore. Essentially. Yeah"
1199760,1206000," Like what even what even is Microsoft's business is pretty clear. They're they're chasing that"
1206000,1210160," I mean why else would they have kept beating this dead bing horse?"
1210160,1212080," Yeah"
1212080,1219200," It's gotta be an advertising model. I mean, obviously they're they're certainly open to to software as a service"
1219200,1221440," I mean we we see that with game pass, but like"
1224080,1225840," again"
1225840,1228320," Back to what the best way to monetize"
1228320,1231120," Something that interacts with you"
1231120,1238000," Like if there was like a youtube premium chat gpt or a youtube premium being powered by chat gpt"
1238000,1241920," Whatever I would pay for that like being premium. Yeah, it won't be though"
1241920,1247360," Because they would they you don't want your brand to be sullied by the crappy version"
1247360,1251840," I mean microsoft learned this back in the day with windows 2000 and windows me"
1252720,1257120," I mean what they look at the why are we maintaining a good kernel"
1257120,1262800," It kernel why don't we just have one good kernel one. Yeah"
1262800,1268160," There was a thread on twitter where people were talking about like what they would pay"
1268160,1270800," for"
1270800,1274880," chat gpt powered by gpt 4.0 whatever sure um"
1274880,1281520," And that you and I both know that that type of interaction is always useless trash"
1282480,1286560," Because all the people talking are like oh pay whatever and then it comes time to do it"
1286560,1287360," And"
1287360,1292000," They don't pulling your actual credit card out of your actual wallet is much higher friction than"
1292000,1298160," Talking about how you're gonna like spend money on the internet. Yeah, um, yeah, it like never means anything"
1298160,1303520," It's completely useless conversation, but I was a little bit surprised knowing all of that"
1303520,1307040," How many people were enthusiastically"
1307040,1309680," wanting to line up to pay for it"
1310480,1312480," um, and I think if they made it a"
1312480,1317840," I don't even know if it's prosumer potentially just straight up professional"
1317840,1324960," application. I think they could make a lot of money from businesses because businesses I think would like"
1324960,1330240," powerful 4.0 powered chat gpt"
1330240,1333360," reinforced employees"
1335440,1341360," And you can you look at how much these platforms are charging companies for such basic crap"
1341360,1347440," Yeah, but it's worth it for the company. So they just pay it anyways. Yeah, like the bill for teams"
1347440,1349840," Yeah"
1349840,1351840," enormous. Yeah, but it's like"
1351840,1359200," Well, what are we gonna not have like guess we'll pay for it like enter in intrac company communication"
1359200,1364320," Are we just gonna not have that? I guess it's it's text chat when text chat was free"
1365040,1366000," like"
1366000,1368000," 20 years ago. I know"
1368000,1373840," But we pay out the nose like it's really expensive. Yes. I know how much it is"
1373840,1379280," It's just drives me. Thank you. It's it's crazy to me"
1379280,1384560," Don't forget. We also pay for g-suite and then it's and it'll be sweet and slack and everything else"
1384560,1386720," um"
1386720,1390480," Yeah, it's it's and they're they're they're really expensive"
1390640,1397440," So if you offer something that was actually powerful and wasn't literally a text chat that barely works. Yeah"
1397440,1401120," I think people would pay a lot for it as a company"
1401120,1404960," Maybe not so much as a person. I don't know"
1404960,1408640," Yeah, I mean how there's because it's all"
1408640,1412560," It's kind of like how we talked about the issue with real estate"
1412560,1418640," Where when people are buying it to live in it the calculus is very different compared to when people are buying it"
1419120,1423760," Based on and pricing it based on how much money they can make from it"
1423760,1426800," Like from my point of view when I look at the cost of something"
1426800,1432000," I'm looking at it in terms of how much time which equals money it saves"
1432000,1438400," So I was talking to dan actually before the show and I was saying hey dan"
1438400,1440400," merch messages"
1440400,1444000," Like wouldn't it be cool if when merch messages come in?"
1444000,1447280," Okay, so when people ask a question or something like that down here"
1447680,1452080," When you guys see a response that is almost always from dan occasionally. I reply to them"
1452080,1457200," Do you ever reply to them to what sorry merch messages like the text reply? Okay, so occasionally I'll reply to them"
1457200,1460000," Um, yeah, here's a reply. There's a reply right there"
1460000,1467600," Usually that's handled by dan and he replies to people just from hearing us talk on the wancho because he's like always here"
1467600,1473440," Or just from things he knows internally he'll try to answer your questions as best you can and I was telling dan I was like hey"
1474240,1477200," A it would save you a ton of time and B"
1477200,1480400," I think it would help you filter"
1480400,1486880," Which ones have been addressed before versus which ones we've talked about or which ones we haven't talked about"
1486880,1490400," If you could just take the transcript of every wancho"
1490400,1494000," dump it into a chat gpt prompt"
1494000,1496320," and then say"
1496320,1497760," based on"
1497760,1499760," This library of information"
1499760,1502400," What's the answer to this?"
1502400,1506160," You do a quick sanity check and then you just paste it in it's like"
1506160,1513040," Oh, you can do that. I know well, I know you can yeah, but how much will it cost? Right?"
1513040,1515760," Yeah, right now. We don't know right now"
1515760,1518800," Nothing, but it's it's in a testing phase"
1518800,1522480," Yeah, they've been very open about the fact that it's just in a testing phase"
1522480,1525840," Yeah, but but and what will the tools look like for that integration?"
1525840,1532320," Like will there be will there be api access so that the merch messages dashboard will properly integrate"
1532320,1538660," with that. People's questions could come in, automatically run through this process,"
1538660,1544160," and then our dashboard could be updated so that Dan only has to see their original message"
1544160,1547280," and the suggested output."
1547280,1549260," So there's two things, one of them—"
1549260,1550260," Sure."
1550260,1553740," A bunch of people in chat were like, \"Why don't you guys just run IRC?\" It's not the"
1553740,1558880," point, it's not the point, it's not the point, it's not the point. I don't even explain"
1558880,1562840," the point, it's just not the point."
1562840,1567560," And two, something that I think is going to be a really interesting reckoning is whenever"
1567560,1574320," chat GPT's model changes, and these tools that people are building that are based on"
1574320,1580440," it now have to react to the model change, that's going to be interesting. I know people"
1580440,1586320," that have sold tools built on chat GPT for 10K plus to companies that are trying to buy"
1586320,1591560," these tools that are chat GPT-powered, and they don't seem to understand that it's"
1591560,1593560," just in a testing phase."
1593560,1594560," It's going to change a lot."
1594560,1600000," It's going to happen eventually, they're going to commercialize it some way eventually."
1600000,1601000," Like soon."
1601000,1602000," Yeah."
1602000,1603000," It seems to me."
1603000,1609600," There are people making customer support bots for commercial pages right now based on"
1609600,1611520," chat GPT."
1611520,1614360," Which like, yeah, right now, honestly, it probably works pretty good."
1614360,1618440," Yeah, but when it costs you 10 cents a message or whatever that."
1618440,1620120," Well, you just have no idea."
1620120,1622520," Yeah, we have no clue."
1622520,1623520," No clue."
1623520,1624520," They might just yolk it."
1624520,1625520," Right."
1625520,1626520," Yeah."
1626520,1628040," They might just say, hey, testing phase is over."
1628040,1629520," Yeah, that's too many calls."
1629520,1630520," Yeah, or that."
1630520,1631520," Yeah."
1631520,1632520," Yeah."
1632520,1633520," To get it."
1633520,1635560," Like, I don't know."
1635560,1637640," I wouldn't want to do that right now."
1637640,1641160," That's all I'm saying."
1641160,1649560," But there's some pretty big core feature infrastructure that is being put on chat GPT,"
1649560,1652200," which is interesting."
1652200,1654680," Okay."
1654680,1660960," Speaking of people missing the point sometimes, I have an update on that thing that I said"
1660960,1663960," and then reversed course on."
1663960,1666160," And now I'm just like, I don't know what to do."
1666160,1667160," Okay."
1667160,1669400," You know how I said I was just going to start."
1669400,1674800," I was going to just start shadow banning people who were just like made my brain hurt."
1674800,1678160," And then the next week, I was like, you know what?"
1678160,1679960," I shadow banned like five people."
1679960,1683720," And then I was like, no, this is this is not this isn't helping anything anyway."
1683720,1687240," It's going to do nothing for improving the quality of discourse because it's an endless"
1687240,1690320," sea of bad takes or whatever else."
1690320,1695520," And I don't want to create an environment where people feel like by by expressing their"
1695520,1700440," thoughts, they could, you know, end up shadow banned, which is like sucky, right?"
1700440,1703000," Like that's never really been our approach to community feedback."
1703000,1704000," Never been the goal."
1704000,1705000," Yeah."
1705000,1710120," Well, you can you can find a nugget of gold in a mountain of poo."
1710120,1712560," And that's that's always kind of been my philosophy about it."
1712560,1717640," So I guess I better keep all the poo so that there's a chance I'll find some gold."
1717640,1721840," Then the next day, I read this."
1721840,1729080," So this is on our 47 TI review, Linus, Dyson made everyone post a review at the same time."
1729080,1730280," We don't work with them anymore."
1730280,1732640," And we don't condone this behavior."
1732640,1737320," Also Linus, when a new computer part launches, yes, corporate daddy will post at the same"
1737320,1740240," time as everyone."
1740240,1742840," Why don't I just shadow ban that person?"
1742840,1743840," Why not?"
1743840,1746480," A, that first thing never happened."
1746480,1748760," We worked with Dyson after that."
1748760,1749760," The part that was bad."
1749760,1751960," We just thought it was kind of stupid."
1751960,1756880," Yeah, the part that was bad was that without telling everybody that everyone else would"
1756880,1762720," be posting these vacuum cleaner videos at exactly the same time, they had like an embargo"
1762720,1765680," lift on sponsored vacuum cleaner videos."
1765680,1767760," And it was it was a fiasco."
1767760,1768760," Bloodbath."
1768760,1770800," Yeah, it was."
1770800,1774480," But I never said we wouldn't work with them anymore."
1774480,1782480," And I never said we don't condone a coordinated product launch."
1782480,1786920," Also Linus, when a new computer part launches, no, it's not yes, corporate daddy will post"
1786920,1788280," at the same time as everyone."
1788280,1790120," It's yes, viewer."
1790120,1794640," We understand that once the news cycle is over, you're not going to watch it."
1794640,1801200," Like a perfect example of this is we pushed back on separate NDA lifts for unboxings."
1801200,1802200," Yeah."
1802200,1804720," Hard when that started to materialize."
1804720,1809480," I think one of the first to do it in the IT space was in video."
1809480,1810720," And I'm so surprised."
1810720,1813200," I already knew that, but like, yeah, it should be surprising to anybody."
1813200,1814560," Yeah, you were you were there."
1814560,1819480," You were literally there when there was like this separate unboxing embargo that who was"
1819480,1826880," it Paul, I think technically didn't break because the card was just there and open and"
1826880,1829480," not in a box or whatever was that how it went down."
1829480,1830480," I remember something about it."
1830480,1833040," Because either Paul or Kyle is one of them, I don't know."
1833040,1839640," But the point is that we pushed back hard on these on these separate NDA's and separate"
1839640,1844160," embargo dates for unboxings compared to full reviews."
1844160,1851760," Now I still don't mind that as much as long as the embargo lift for the full review is"
1851760,1854800," at the same time as sales availability."
1854800,1859360," That's fine because that means before you're taking people's money, they will have an opportunity"
1859360,1862040," to see the product properly evaluated."
1862040,1870680," But I do think that a separate NDA lift for unboxings, so I mean, we're up to like three"
1870680,1873120," NDA's for a product launch at this point."
1873120,1875040," There's the announcement embargo."
1875040,1876920," There's the unboxing embargo."
1876920,1879000," And then there's the review embargo."
1879000,1883440," And then sometimes they'll try and sneak another one in there like like a preview embargo"
1883440,1886960," where you can run specific titles or whatever else."
1886960,1890880," And it's gotten kind of ridiculous, but you guys have to understand why they're doing"
1890880,1891880," it."
1891880,1898080," It's because they are leveraging the short attention span or really the shortness of"
1898080,1901480," the news cycle to great effect."
1901480,1907600," And this is one of those things that I just, I don't know what you guys want me to do"
1907600,1909840," because I don't like it."
1909840,1913800," But you guys are ultimately the ones who create this game that I'm playing."
1913800,1921160," I see a lot of people blame the algorithm, okay, for clickable titles and thumbnails,"
1921160,1922160," right?"
1922160,1923160," Or for the,"
1923160,1924160," - The algorithm just reacts to people."
1924160,1927760," - Or the proliferation of garbage content on YouTube."
1927760,1935240," - We the people are the reason why microtransactions are so incredibly smart to put in your game."
1935240,1940120," - All the algorithm is, and this was such a great conversation, multiple conversations"
1940120,1942160," because I was very resistant to it first."
1942160,1950120," One of my favorite contacts at YouTube, head of search and discovery basically has drilled"
1950120,1954800," into me and he's right."
1954800,1960000," Every time you open your mouth to say something, something, algorithm, something, something,"
1960000,1967640," something, try replacing algorithm with the word audience and you will find a much more,"
1967640,1972640," accurate understanding of what exactly is going on."
1972640,1976800," So this is what ultimately bothered me."
1976800,1984160," For the launch of the 7900 XT and 7900 XTX, AMD played the game."
1984160,1988800," They had two separate embargoes, one for unboxing or well three, right?"
1988800,1991320," Announcement unboxing and then the full review."
1991320,1995880," The unboxing video, which I'm not going to, I'm not going to pretend that it's anything"
1995880,1998040," other than what it is."
1998040,2000960," It's low effort content, right?"
2000960,2003320," I've got this box."
2003320,2005200," I open it."
2005200,2008160," There's some specs, right?"
2008160,2013360," I give some thoughts on it, but if I have measured the performance of it, I'm not allowed"
2013360,2015840," to tell you, right?"
2015840,2016840," We can extrapolate."
2016840,2022400," I feel like we added a little bit of value to some of our pre-review coverage of the 7900"
2022400,2030840," batteries by taking what AMD had provided, recreating that bench as closely as we could,"
2030840,2035440," and then extrapolating how we would expect it to perform against the competition when"
2035440,2037120," AMD wasn't disclosing that."
2037120,2043560," We did everything we could with it, but at the end of the day, that's pretty shallow content."
2043560,2051160," That video ended up with 1.9 million views, took a grand total of about an hour of prep"
2051160,2059000," time for someone to just put together a spec list and grab some cards, some relevant comparison"
2059000,2065360," cards off the shelf for me, then about another 40 minutes of me sitting down in front of"
2065360,2066960," a camera."
2066960,2068520," That's it."
2068520,2072880," That is the grand total time we spent on it."
2072880,2079160," Then our full review, and we got to remember too that both of these are with us throwing"
2079160,2086480," the full power of our wonderful thumbnail artist, Maria, and all the expertise we have internally"
2086480,2093960," in terms of titling videos and trying to create catchy intros and all that kind of stuff."
2093960,2099920," Our full review ended up with a whopping 1.9 million views."
2099920,2102720," That doesn't sound like a problem, right?"
2102720,2108400," Okay, so the unboxing and the review ended up with similar view counts, except for a couple"
2108400,2109400," of things."
2109400,2118040," Number one is that that review is, in my humble opinion, the second best GPU review we've"
2118040,2123040," ever done, followed only by the 47ETI, and that's only because it came a little bit later"
2123040,2128600," once we got our workflow settled in a little bit better."
2128600,2135840," And number two, it's on a way bigger channel, like way bigger."
2135840,2141440," But I'm just, I don't know, man, I feel like I'm rambling a little bit now at this point."
2141440,2145800," I'm kind of bothered by how many people look at that short circuit video, which we never"
2145800,2147640," call a review."
2147640,2150040," We never put a review in the description."
2150040,2151400," I never say review in the video."
2151400,2159120," The number of people that think it's a review, and just the appetite for deeper, more analytical"
2159120,2171800," content is just not there compared to just this surface level content."
2171800,2176960," So how did I arrive here?"
2176960,2182680," We're talking about the comment and how you want to remove it because it's annoying."
2182680,2183680," Yeah, okay."
2183680,2185480," It's just bad faith arguments like that."
2185480,2187040," It's really frustrating."
2187040,2188040," Yeah."
2188040,2193040," There you go."
2193040,2200560," Well, I mean, I think it's like you're screwed if you do, and you're screwed if you don't."
2200560,2209880," Yeah, because I mean, unless I were to publish some kind of official policy, like a code"
2209880,2215680," of conduct by which I decide to, if someone is shadow-band or not, I read a particularly"
2215680,2220800," frustrating thread on the forum either today or yesterday where there were a number of"
2220800,2224640," people making, again, these just extraordinarily bad faith arguments."
2224640,2227640," In this case, it was about the screwdriver in the backpack."
2227640,2234120," And one in particular wrote this wall of text about this long after someone challenged"
2234120,2239880," them because what they said before was I could go on AliExpress and get that screwdriver"
2239880,2242920," in that backpack for a fraction of the price."
2242920,2248840," The cost on that screwdriver is like this low, and someone was like, okay, then do it."
2248840,2249840," Show me."
2249840,2251840," And they wrote this wall of text."
2251840,2256800," I'm not going to bother because it's not worth my time, but here's all the knowledge"
2256800,2259560," I have about how that, so I replied."
2259560,2262480," I was just like, I will give you 10 grand."
2262480,2265880," I will give you $10,000 if you can do that."
2265880,2266880," It's worth your time now."
2266880,2267880," It's worth your time now."
2267880,2268880," It's just on AliExpress."
2268880,2269880," Where's your excuse?"
2269880,2270880," Yeah."
2270880,2283760," And it's just like, I don't know how to have a conversation when the person on the other"
2283760,2290880," side of the table is not capable of existing in the same plane of reality that I'm in."
2290880,2297280," They say, I can get that screwdriver for $10, and I say, you cannot."
2297280,2299120," Would you like to reevaluate your position?"
2299120,2300120," No, thank you."
2300120,2307840," And I don't know how to deal with that."
2307840,2308840," You know?"
2308840,2309840," Yeah."
2309840,2312600," It's like, what do you want from me?"
2312600,2320920," Do you need my invoices from Megapro, from pH molds, from ITD tool and dye?"
2320920,2322320," Do you?"
2322320,2326120," Like, we're pretty transparent, actually."
2326120,2328920," Someone's asking if they can enter the contest."
2328920,2329920," You can't do it."
2329920,2330920," Go for it."
2330920,2331920," You can't--"
2331920,2332920," It's the whole point."
2332920,2335880," There is no AliExpress vendor."
2335880,2344960," Those handles are injection molded in pit meadows, or excuse me, maple ridge British Columbia."
2344960,2346480," Like you can't."
2346480,2348320," It just doesn't work that way."
2348320,2349320," It's just one thing."
2349320,2352400," You're missing the point, my dude."
2352400,2356200," And it's like, it's one of those things where, you know, if you were willing to open your"
2356200,2359560," eyes and open your mind, you would know."
2359560,2367760," I mean, we have footage of me in the injection molding facility, hand building screwdrivers"
2367760,2373160," here, you know?"
2373160,2374880," I can't."
2374880,2375880," So--"
2375880,2376880," Yeah, go ahead."
2376880,2377880," No, I keep going."
2377880,2379360," I was trying to derail us, so if you have more to say--"
2379360,2380360," No, I mean, no, it's great."
2380360,2384560," I mean, honestly, like, obviously you guys are-- you guys are the Wancho audience."
2384560,2388400," You guys-- you guys get it, and you're-- you've got my best interests at heart, I think,"
2388400,2391080," and you're sitting here going line, it's don't engage."
2391080,2393120," And you're right."
2393120,2398920," But the thing that you haven't experienced, and, you know, one of the reasons that honestly,"
2398920,2403760," you know, Luke or the other people internally here or my fellow YouTubers or some of the"
2403760,2410800," only people that I feel like I can really talk to about these things, is that you've"
2410800,2421000," never experienced these thousands or hundreds or even dozens of attacks that come--"
2421000,2424440," And you're not allowed to defend generally."
2424440,2428640," And you guys are basically saying, don't defend yourself."
2428640,2431640," But the thing is, is that it doesn't go away."
2431640,2435960," And in some cases, what can happen is it can even grow."
2435960,2440520," And so, you know, I'm kind of looking at it going, you know, okay, a perfect example"
2440520,2447880," is when we had that sexual assault accusation, right?"
2447880,2456200," And I basically took the very controversial internally move of kind of going, okay, here"
2456200,2460320," is my entire relationship history."
2460320,2461320," Start to finish."
2461320,2466040," The only part that was controversial with me was the details."
2466040,2468360," I didn't need to know it tastes like smoke."
2468360,2470760," I will never forget that."
2470760,2473800," I just thought it was kind of funny for that one."
2473800,2479360," It was the most memorable thing about it."
2479360,2480800," Sorry, keep going."
2480800,2483520," So I took the controversial move of basically going, okay, fine."
2483520,2486680," Then, you know, full transparency, here's everything."
2486680,2493040," So anything that doesn't match that, I will not be acknowledging because that didn't happen."
2493040,2495680," So now I don't have to talk about it anymore."
2495680,2503000," But like there's kind of this contingent that refuses to acknowledge any sort of fact"
2503000,2507040," or reality and is always just kind of, I mean, haters going to hate, I guess is the bottom"
2507040,2509200," line and it wears on you."
2509200,2510200," Yeah."
2510200,2511200," Like it really does."
2511200,2514160," And you want to do something about it."
2514160,2521320," And like, this happened on my tour of OVH."
2521320,2525960," There was the do do do do do."
2525960,2527160," Let me see."
2527160,2532000," Yeah, the RTX 6000."
2532000,2539640," And like, who's fault is it that there's a card called the RTX 6000?"
2539640,2541760," It's what it's in videos fault."
2541760,2545720," But I had to say it in the video and I knew when I said it that people are going to go,"
2545720,2547200," huh?"
2547200,2550800," And there's all the, and this is so light and who cares."
2550800,2555880," But there's all these comments everywhere on float plane, on, on YouTube, on everything."
2555880,2558720," One idiot, that card doesn't exist."
2558720,2560560," What a dummy."
2560560,2564280," And the whole time, every single, and this is so light compared to what he's talking"
2564280,2565280," about."
2565280,2569600," But every single time I read that, I'm just like, man, like you, there's a bunch of parts"
2569600,2571160," of the video that are not that great."
2571160,2576320," Like you can call me out on that, but why are you calling me out on this?"
2576320,2579400," And then I want to respond to every single one of them."
2579400,2582200," And then it's just like, okay, no, I need to not do this."
2582200,2583200," Yeah."
2583200,2586120," And it bothers you, right?"
2586120,2592520," Because like, especially in cases where you, you know it was, you know you were right."
2592520,2599760," You just kind of go, well, now, now you're going to sit and think that forever."
2599760,2600760," Yeah."
2600760,2607520," And given that our entire job is trying to inform people about technology, I just like,"
2607520,2613840," I could sit at my keyboard all day correcting misconceptions literally all day and do absolutely"
2613840,2614840," nothing else."
2614840,2616360," That'd be a funny video."
2616360,2620160," I mean, we've done Linus response to haters."
2620160,2623920," I guess, or no, we've done Linus response to mean comments."
2623920,2627240," You should do like the thumbnails, like you pointing at this create just as you're wrong"
2627240,2628240," as the thumbnail."
2628240,2629340," But here's the problem."
2629340,2636400," So we, I guess about about six months ago, we created, well, I shouldn't say we James"
2636400,2638840," created, it doesn't matter."
2638840,2639840," Timeline doesn't matter."
2639840,2642920," Sometime in the last little while James created a document called how to make good"
2642920,2644160," videos."
2644160,2650520," And in how to make good videos, he created a section based on a conversation that we had"
2650520,2653560," had called the laws of Linus."
2653560,2660040," And there's a bunch of really interesting stuff in here that I have, even though not"
2660040,2664720," all of it is actually from me, it was a, it was a team effort building, building it."
2664720,2670760," And I probably wouldn't have called it that just because it's sort of a silly thing."
2670760,2672080," But it's got, he put a flex on."
2672080,2673280," It's a fun acronym, right?"
2673280,2674280," Yeah, I guess so."
2674280,2675280," Sure."
2675280,2676280," Yeah."
2676280,2682520," So the laws, the laws got them really did like you better when you couldn't talk."
2682520,2684520," It's a better show that way."
2684520,2687680," So it was a little disheartening how many people were like, this was the best show."
2687680,2689240," I was like, all right."
2689240,2691440," Yes, we hear haters."
2691440,2692440," Okay."
2692440,2694040," I have to tell you though."
2694040,2697560," And this is the first time I'm telling him on air, but I told you after the show last"
2697560,2706240," week as well, it is actually far more helpful than you and you guys probably realize to"
2706240,2715320," have a friendly presence, like essentially a living, breathing, laugh track, slash supporter"
2715320,2721280," just sitting next to you while you ramble on and on about things kind of nodding or"
2721280,2724120," raising an eyebrow when you say something stupid."
2724120,2728960," Like I could imagine at the height of the pandemic, you know, being an athlete, performing"
2728960,2731240," in an empty stadium."
2731240,2733520," You know, I don't know."
2733520,2735040," Did I play that shot?"
2735040,2736040," Good."
2736040,2737560," You know, like there's no feedback."
2737560,2739040," There's no feedback whatsoever."
2739040,2740040," Yeah."
2740040,2742160," And it really does, it really does get you going."
2742160,2744680," Anyway, back to the laws of Linus."
2744680,2749760," One of the laws is never insult the audience."
2749760,2751240," It doesn't go well."
2751240,2752240," Yeah."
2752240,2753480," And I do it from time to time."
2753480,2755000," I break the rules."
2755000,2759280," You know, someone on, I honestly feel more liberated with the float plane audience because"
2759280,2761800," realistically they pay for the subscription."
2761800,2762800," They're probably hardcore."
2762800,2764440," They can probably handle it."
2764440,2767920," And you know, every once in a while, you know, there'll be a brain dead enough take that"
2767920,2768920," I'm just like, you know what?"
2768920,2772160," No, we're going to, we're going to talk about this because that's, that's pretty bad."
2772160,2778120," But I shouldn't, I shouldn't because, hold on, I'm trying to find the bloody part of it."
2778120,2780720," This is driving me absolutely crazy."
2780720,2781720," Okay, fine."
2781720,2785120," I will resort to find and replace."
2785120,2787520," Is it insult or no, it must be attack."
2787520,2788960," Guys, I'm, I'm fine."
2788960,2789960," You don't have to."
2789960,2791440," Yeah, here it is."
2791440,2795160," Do not personally attack the viewer no matter how wrong or stupid their beliefs are, not"
2795160,2796840," even an implied attack."
2796840,2801240," And this has actually helped us a lot over the last little while because there have been"
2801240,2807600," a few videos where we, you know, we'd make an offhand joke."
2807600,2815080," Say for example, about like DDR2 memory, you know, being old."
2815080,2817440," And it's like, well, hold on a second."
2817440,2822520," In a lot of parts of the world, DDR2 is like still expensive and still current."
2822520,2828120," And it's easy to live in our, in our North American bubble and to, and it's not even"
2828120,2834600," necessarily wrong to live in our North American bubble because that's where solid like almost"
2834600,2841440," 60% of our viewership comes from with probably another 30% from, you know, Western, Western"
2841440,2842440," Europe."
2842440,2847320," So like your Germany's and, and UK's and Francis of the world, places like that."
2847320,2848320," Yeah."
2848320,2854680," But you've got to understand that when you are broadcasting to literally millions of"
2854680,2863080," people, if only 1% of them are personally attacked by what you say, then you just upset"
2863080,2867680," a thousand, 10,000 people for what?"
2867680,2868680," Yeah."
2868680,2869680," Why?"
2869680,2870680," To what end?"
2870680,2871680," Yeah."
2871680,2872680," Like why?"
2872680,2875960," So one of the things that I'll do during script review with people now is I'll say like,"
2875960,2881800," Hey, why are we poking fun at people who liked Windows Vista?"
2881800,2884040," That's just just an example."
2884040,2885040," Why are we doing that?"
2885040,2886960," And they're like, cause it's funny cause they're dumb."
2886960,2890520," I'm like, well, a I like Windows Vista."
2890520,2894760," Not so funny now, is it?"
2894760,2899080," But that's not even the point because be who cares."
2899080,2900080," Is there a benefit?"
2900080,2901080," Yeah."
2901080,2905200," And honestly, this is something where Yvonne has been a really good influence on me because"
2905200,2911600," she has basically said, Hey, look, I think that you're too aggro."
2911600,2915880," And I think that you're going to catch a lot more flies with honey than with vinegar."
2915880,2917600," And she's, she's right."
2917600,2924560," I have basically never one, I shouldn't say I have never."
2924560,2934000," I have rarely witnessed like an aggressive approach winning an argument on the internet."
2934000,2936000," Think about it."
2936000,2940000," I, so I agree with the statement in general."
2940000,2944800," I think sometimes it is not."
2944800,2946800," Okay."
2946800,2948360," So this is, this is a tech channel."
2948360,2949480," We're talking about tech topics."
2949480,2950480," Yeah."
2950480,2953080," So it should basically always be honey because who cares?"
2953080,2954080," Sure."
2954080,2963080," But I don't think this applies to all arguments one could have, if that makes sense."
2963080,2964200," We've talked about this before."
2964200,2967320," I don't remember how I phrased it, but I think it was like sometimes you want to catch them"
2967320,2969360," with the vinegar or whatever."
2969360,2975600," Like I, there's certain times where like I'm not willing to acknowledge any potential"
2975600,2977920," benefits of the argument on the other side."
2977920,2979520," So I'm not going to approach it with."
2979520,2983960," But you don't have to acknowledge merit, you don't have to acknowledge any merit of their"
2983960,2988720," argument when there isn't any, but you could acknowledge maybe how they feel."
2988720,2989720," No."
2989720,2990720," Okay."
2990720,2996160," There's certain, there are certain arguments where I, I think no."
2996160,3000520," There is not like a ton of them necessarily, but there are certain arguments where I think"
3000520,3001520," no."
3001520,3002520," That's fair."
3002520,3004640," I don't know."
3004640,3007040," Intolerance will not be tolerated."
3007040,3008040," Yeah."
3008040,3009040," Yes."
3009040,3013200," I mean, that's fair enough."
3013200,3022200," What we will also not tolerate is AI art generators blatantly ripping off the source material on"
3022200,3024320," which they were trained."
3024320,3025320," That's right."
3025320,3026320," I called this."
3026320,3034160," There is already a two major copyright lawsuits against AI art generators."
3034160,3039920," Geddy Images claims that stability AI scraped the Geddy Images site using it as a database"
3039920,3044920," to train its own AI art generator."
3044920,3050040," These claims are corroborated by an independent study that found that stable diffusion was"
3050040,3054240," trained on hundreds of thousands of images sourced from stock image sites."
3054240,3059760," Notably, stable diffusion has a funny habit of recreating the Geddy Images watermark in"
3059760,3062800," the images that it produces."
3062800,3065840," And this is a figure two down below."
3065840,3068800," This is high lariest."
3068800,3071640," That's really funny."
3071640,3077120," Whoops."
3077120,3079000," This is a super weird image."
3079000,3080000," It is."
3080000,3082480," Is this supposed to be like a baseball catcher?"
3082480,3084440," It looks like baseball mixed with football."
3084440,3086400," It really does."
3086400,3089880," I do have to wonder what the prompt was."
3089880,3096600," Also, I kind of have to wonder what kind of roids this guy's got going on here."
3096600,3100600," Though if you take steroids, that is your own life choice."
3100600,3101600," Don't be upset."
3101600,3103280," No, it's holding the audience."
3103280,3104280," I like it."
3104280,3105280," Yeah."
3105280,3107080," I actually just don't care."
3107080,3116680," Like if that's what you want to do to your testicles, then like mine are bigger."
3116680,3119840," Okay, I bring my rules sometimes."
3119840,3128080," Might be short, but he's got them big ones."
3128080,3132880," A study from the University of Maryland found that stable diffusion can sometimes end up"
3132880,3136840," closely replicating images from its training database."
3136840,3142280," These aren't pixel perfect copies, but the derivation is pretty blatant."
3142280,3151680," That is figure one over here where, yep, I don't think it takes a genius to see that"
3151680,3155320," there's a relationship here."
3155320,3156320," Yeah."
3156320,3161120," I mean, you can't even move the wolves around a little bit."
3161120,3162360," Where's the moon?"
3162360,3164760," Give me three wolves and a moon, you know?"
3164760,3166320," Give me something to work with here."
3166320,3168360," Make it defensible."
3168360,3173920," The second major lawsuit is a class action against stability AI, deviant art and mid"
3173920,3178880," journey claiming that their art generators are simply remixing the copyrighted works of"
3178880,3180520," millions of artists."
3180520,3187000," The lawsuits website calls such AI generators 21st century collage tools."
3187000,3194080," And it's an interesting thing because like the bloodborne one, for instance, if the lower"
3194080,3200400," image, which I believe is the AI generated image, I think, I actually don't know."
3200400,3201920," I actually don't know."
3201920,3205880," But I kind of doesn't matter because they're similar enough to each other that it's irrelevant."
3205880,3206880," And that's sort of the point."
3206880,3207880," Yeah."
3207880,3214200," So say the AI generated image is used for, let's say, a mobile game, right?"
3214200,3224680," If it was called white blood cell birth and it was on the Apple store, they would probably"
3224680,3228520," be gone after because their bloodborne would say that's too close to our logo because you"
3228520,3230920," just clearly ripped off our logo, right?"
3230920,3231920," Yeah."
3231920,3233920," So it's the same thing."
3233920,3240280," And like I've been caught in this argument a little bit because I went anti AI art and"
3240280,3245920," I went pro AI, the large language model and people didn't like that I was kind of on"
3245920,3247280," each side of the fence."
3247280,3249480," But this is kind of the example."
3249480,3256280," And I don't know 100% really where it ends up being okay because it's still 100% true"
3256280,3259920," that the large language model is trained off of other people's stuff."
3259920,3262640," It's not not true that that is a thing."
3262640,3265600," But it's a lot less apparent."
3265600,3267160," It's way less apparent."
3267160,3268800," You don't have it do this."
3268800,3272240," You can get chat GPT to spit out things that other people have written."
3272240,3273240," Yes."
3273240,3274240," It's happened."
3274240,3275240," But it's not as egregious."
3275240,3277040," It doesn't seem as common."
3277040,3278040," Stuff like that."
3278040,3284360," It seems like it's done better, but it also seems like it was easier to do it better because"
3284360,3287520," it's a large language model and the way that works is easier."
3287520,3290840," But when it comes to art, we're seeing a lot of this."
3290840,3295840," I had the example that I gave in the previous one showing these three examples are just"
3295840,3297360," as blatant."
3297360,3300680," I mean, here's the thing though."
3300680,3303440," Are people there?"
3303440,3304440," Okay."
3304440,3309400," I'm going to ask a spicy question."
3309400,3318760," Does it matter what the law is if the overall social benefit outweighs the drawback to those"
3318760,3321560," few who are affected by it?"
3321560,3326520," And to be clear, I'm not taking the position that, you know, the ends justify the means"
3326520,3327520," here."
3327520,3334960," I'm just asking if we all collectively kind of decide this is okay because it has to be"
3334960,3340760," okay because this is really convenient for our lives that we can create a children's"
3340760,3346080," book from scratch in a weekend without needing an illustrator because we never learned to"
3346080,3348520," draw."
3348520,3350800," Is this ultimately going to fizzle out?"
3350800,3353600," And are these lawsuits going to just eventually go away?"
3353600,3357000," I don't think that's the average stance though, so I don't think it would."
3357000,3364360," Well, it's not the average stance now, but most people have not used an AI image generator"
3364360,3365360," yet."
3365360,3369960," Once people get used to the convenience of an AI image generator, will they be willing"
3369960,3372080," to let it go?"
3372080,3373520," Ooh."
3373520,3375000," Yeah."
3375000,3376960," My pessimism would say no."
3376960,3377960," Right?"
3377960,3388120," I mean, okay, another perfect example of sometimes the gulf that exists between what is ethical"
3388120,3396040," and legally acceptable versus what is socially acceptable would be something like the way"
3396040,3399120," that some creators approach react content."
3399120,3401880," And I know this is going to be a hot..."
3401880,3403080," It's going to be a spicy potato."
3403080,3404560," There's going to be a hot take."
3404560,3410880," No, I can't believe he's talking about this, but it's actually pretty cut and dried."
3410880,3411880," I'm not going to..."
3411880,3417000," There's no point not being transparent about it because the internet never forgets anything,"
3417000,3421880," so I might as well just tell you guys we're working on a react channel."
3421880,3426560," It is f***ing effort."
3426560,3428320," Easy content."
3428320,3437040," And it is obscenely profitable if you can generate a bunch of views on content that"
3437040,3439680," takes almost literally no time."
3439680,3440680," That's what it is."
3440680,3443320," That's what react content is."
3443320,3444320," And..."
3444320,3445320," What's your approach to the..."
3445320,3446320," I'm very intrigued."
3446320,3448440," What is the approach to the react content channel?"
3448440,3453280," Well, first I'm going to talk about what are the obvious problems with some of the react"
3453280,3454800," content that's out there."
3454800,3458600," The defense that is used by... and I'm not going to name anyone because I just don't..."
3458600,3460600," I don't need any beef in my life."
3460600,3464080," It's a waste of brain energy for me."
3464080,3470160," But the argument that is often used to defend it is fair use."
3470160,3474800," Fair use is a gray area for one thing."
3474800,3478320," It actually has to be defended in court."
3478320,3484400," It is not as simple as, well, it's fair use therefore it's fine."
3484400,3490280," The only reason that you might get away with saying it's fair use is if nobody chooses"
3490280,3491960," to challenge you on it."
3491960,3498120," So in a way you could look at that fair use argument for react content as basically just"
3498120,3506400," a way that large creators can turn their nose up at small creators who can't afford to defend"
3506400,3514080," their work by saying essentially because you can't afford to sue me, it's fair use."
3514080,3518680," That's a pretty shitty stance."
3518680,3524360," And a lot of what gets defended as fair use is clearly not."
3524360,3529480," Google has a support doc for this because they run a little site you might have heard"
3529480,3532160," of before called YouTube."
3532160,3536240," And so they have a lot of legal Q&A on there."
3536240,3540320," And the four factors of fair use are laid out or pillars if you want to call them that"
3540320,3542240," are laid out pretty clearly."
3542240,3546480," So there's the purpose and character of the use including whether such use is commercial"
3546480,3550880," or is for nonprofit educational purposes."
3550880,3553320," If it's commercial, that's a big strike against you."
3553320,3560320," And the second you hit monetization or pimp t-shirts or screwdrivers or whatever else,"
3560320,3565400," that's very commercial use."
3565400,3568600," Courts typically focus on whether the use is transformative."
3568600,3573560," That is whether it adds new expression or meaning to the original or whether it merely"
3573560,3575160," copies from the original."
3575160,3576880," And this is a spectrum, right?"
3576880,3579680," This is not just black and white."
3579680,3582560," It adds new expression or it doesn't."
3582560,3586080," It's up to the interpretation and it's up to the arguments that get made."
3586080,3592200," Number two is the nature of the copyrighted work, right?"
3592200,3597520," So using material from a factual work is more likely to be fair than from a fictional"
3597520,3598520," work."
3598520,3603880," Number three, the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted"
3603880,3604880," work as a whole."
3604880,3611080," And this is where a lot of react content as it is right now is in deep doo doo."
3611080,3614280," A lot of people in the chat are talking about the H3 ruling."
3614280,3621040," Yes, that did go in favor of Ethan, but you've also got to remember and understand that fair"
3621040,3626240," use is something that is tackled on a case by case basis by the courts."
3626240,3633600," And in the case of H3 productions versus that guy, I can't remember his name, Ethan to his"
3633600,3638840," credit did not use the entire original source."
3638840,3651320," And the bulk of the video was for better or for worse, H3's commentary, right?"
3651320,3657960," As opposed to just the original work being consumed in a way that is not benefiting the"
3657960,3660920," original rights holder in any way."
3660920,3665680," Number four, and this is another huge one that is highly problematic with a lot of react"
3665680,3672440," content right now, the effect on the potential market for or the value of the copyrighted"
3672440,3673440," work."
3673440,3681400," If you play the entire video as part of the video, the impact is enormous."
3681400,3686640," Like if like, let's say for example, someone did a react video to one of ours where they"
3686640,3693160," pulled a few key things, but largely transformed it, largely contributed their own thoughts"
3693160,3695640," and their own expression."
3695640,3700000," That is pretty obviously fair use even though it is commercial."
3700000,3707920," So usually I wouldn't consider our content to be primarily purely fictional."
3707920,3715280," I'd say that we strive to create factual works, so it is more likely to be covered by fair"
3715280,3716280," use."
3716280,3721400," The character of the use while it is commercial, it would be highly transformative."
3721400,3726400," And the amount of that is used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole could be"
3726400,3727640," quite low."
3727640,3732480," There also is potentially a positive effect on the potential market for the copyrighted"
3732480,3733920," work."
3733920,3739840," So in the case of something like, let's say, let's step with the example that we're using"
3739840,3742480," just for the sake of ease of following along."
3742480,3747400," So if you only provide snippets of the original video, but explicitly in your content you"
3747400,3751160," say, but there's some key parts of it that you should go check out."
3751160,3753080," I've got it linked down below."
3753080,3756440," There's a much stronger argument for fair use."
3756440,3763920," As it is right now, if you upload a video that is essentially the entire original work for"
3763920,3772280," profit for yourself with some chunks where you respond to or react to or talk over the"
3772280,3777240," original work, there is no reason whatsoever to go watch the original work."
3777240,3782560," And so you'll see these large creators that are getting, in some cases, many times the"
3782560,3788480," viewership of the original work at the cost of the original work."
3788480,3792760," And I honestly don't have, I don't have the solution to this right now."
3792760,3797440," Because like, it's pretty clear that YouTube's copyright claim system is pretty broken."
3797440,3804040," Like even if something was clearly not fair use, you know, a, I don't necessarily think"
3804040,3810120," that I would be entitled to 100% of the revenue, which to my knowledge is the only way you"
3810120,3811800," can copyright claim something."
3811800,3816120," And basically just say, I think that's all mine."
3816120,3818720," Or you can say, I think I deserve nothing."
3818720,3821000," There's no middle ground whatsoever."
3821000,3826200," And two, the community backlash is just not worth it because there's this perception that"
3826200,3830160," I don't, I don't know."
3830160,3838080," I actually, I actually just don't really understand why because sitting as someone who is relatively"
3838080,3844360," speaking on the top of the online creator pyramid, I can tell you right now that the"
3844360,3850920," community backlash that follows any smaller creator who's trying to enforce a fucking"
3850920,3855720," copyright is wrong."
3855720,3856880," It's wrong."
3856880,3858400," It's just plain wrong."
3858400,3862240," It benefits the people who are at the top who don't need it."
3862240,3864000," They actually have money."
3864000,3867920," They could hire staff, create something original."
3867920,3869840," Get equipment, whatever."
3869840,3874480," Whereas the people who are at the bottom actually need it."
3874480,3878800," They can't build a screwdriver from scratch and sell a hundred thousand units, right?"
3878800,3881520," Like they don't, they don't have the same tools."
3881520,3891920," And so to, to ignore, to ignore these arguments just because, you know, we don't like what"
3891920,3896680," people being mean to people we've formed a parasocial relationship with."
3896680,3897680," It's messed up, man."
3897680,3898680," Okay."
3898680,3901120," So all of that being said, how's yours going to work?"
3901120,3906960," So what I've got in the, I'm not signed into that account on here in one sec."
3906960,3907960," Good."
3907960,3908960," Yes."
3908960,3909960," Yes."
3909960,3910960," Yes."
3910960,3911960," Yes."
3911960,3912960," Yes."
3912960,3913960," Yes."
3913960,3914960," Yes."
3914960,3915960," Yes."
3915960,3916960," Yes."
3916960,3917960," Yes."
3917960,3917960," So basically, I shoot it's in the comments, general reaction channel guidelines."
3917960,3919800," Timeliness is hugely important."
3919800,3921360," Blah, blah, blah, blah."
3921360,3922360," No."
3922360,3923360," No."
3923360,3924360," Where is it?"
3924360,3927160," That time someone reacted to one of our things."
3927160,3929480," Yeah, it was really, really interesting."
3929480,3935380," So again, as a, as a content creator, I have, you know, actual numbers for how beneficial"
3935380,3937680," reaction content is to the original creator."
3937680,3938680," The answer is."
3938680,3940480," Fucking much."
3940480,3945360," In case you guys are wondering, and that's even as someone with a substantial following"
3945360,3951260," already and whose content might already have significant momentum on, on a channel from"
3951260,3955040," someone who's only ever upload, or on a channel that's only ever uploaded one video"
3955040,3958940," or something like that, where they don't have that, that critical mass."
3958940,3961980," I do think there's multiple arguments here."
3961980,3962980," Sure."
3962980,3965780," And it depends on the nature of the inclusion."
3965780,3966780," Yes."
3966780,3969820," If you include, so this is, okay, I'm getting to it."
3969820,3970820," Okay."
3970820,3972500," I'm getting to it."
3972500,3977460," Unfortunately, I just don't have the, basically I lay, I don't know."
3977460,3978460," I can't find it."
3978460,3979460," I've seen it work."
3979460,3984220," I've laid out some guidelines for what I would consider to be like, like ethical reaction"
3984220,3990580," content, where the goal, the stated purpose and not just the stated purpose, but the actual"
3990580,3995420," goal of the content needs to be to uplift the original creator, as opposed to coming"
3995420,4002260," back to the pillars of fair use, harm the value or potential market for the original"
4002260,4003760," work."
4003760,4008340," And I think that's something that has just been completely lost."
4008340,4012980," I think there's, I think there's been, I think there is and there has been reaction content"
4012980,4016980," that is like clearly exploitative, exploitative."
4016980,4017980," Exploitative."
4017980,4018980," Yes."
4018980,4022020," But he has been practicing talking for a week."
4022020,4025220," It's actually true."
4025220,4029100," That's probably not the reason why that just happened, but it is true."
4029100,4033860," But I have also seen reaction content that has like made channels, basically."
4033860,4034860," For sure."
4034860,4035860," For sure."
4035860,4036860," It totally happens."
4036860,4040300," I think a lot of it we were talking about earlier, but like how instead of the algorithm,"
4040300,4043260," you should say community, I think a lot of it has to do with the community that follows"
4043260,4049540," that person are the only ever going to watch this person's content because of the host"
4049540,4052980," and they have no real cares about the source."
4052980,4054140," And they're never going to follow through."
4054140,4055700," They never going to go to that channel."
4055700,4057340," They're never going to check it out, whatever."
4057340,4061180," Or is it a community of people that are going to follow through and are going to give support"
4061180,4064180," when they want, when the creator watches different videos or whatever."
4064180,4066340," The problem with that argument is it's not up to you."
4066340,4067340," Yeah."
4067340,4068700," It's up to the original copyright holder."
4068700,4070100," Well, for sure."
4070100,4071100," Yeah."
4071100,4072380," So it doesn't matter what you think."
4072380,4074820," No, well, that's not a good take."
4074820,4076020," Well, it doesn't though."
4076020,4077020," Well, it doesn't matter."
4077020,4078020," That's not my statement."
4078020,4083020," Oh, I thought you were saying that I as the reactor can just decide."
4083020,4086780," Well, my audience isn't really going to follow through on this, so I should just show it"
4086780,4087780," to them."
4087780,4088780," No."
4088780,4089780," Oh, OK, I misunderstood you."
4089780,4090780," No."
4090780,4094620," Because like really what I'm saying is that in, and I think especially the current era,"
4094620,4097620," there's a big mix of ones that are good and aren't good."
4097620,4103420," And obviously even within individuals, there's a mix of doing the right thing and being"
4103420,4104420," extremely lazy."
4104420,4111860," I've seen example clips of someone who will go from really good reactionary content to"
4111860,4116780," a piece of content that probably wants you to that probably makes you want to go follow"
4116780,4118820," through and see the original creator, all that kind of stuff."
4118820,4122460," And then the next clip, they're like eating."
4122460,4125060," So it just plays the video and they literally never say a whole thing."
4125060,4127460," And then just like, hmm, while they're chewing."
4127460,4130460," And it's like, wow, all right."
4130460,4131460," Yeah."
4131460,4135500," I don't really know what to say about this, but I know what to say."
4135500,4139660," But they might watch LTT and I'm not supposed to insult the audience."
4139660,4141820," Got them."
4141820,4143300," But yeah, I don't know."
4143300,4148580," It's I know of channels that exist that basically only exist because reaction channels"
4148580,4153900," blew them up, but then I also know of channels that hate it and have openly tried to get"
4153900,4156020," people to stop and people just keep doing it."
4156020,4157020," Yeah."
4157020,4160580," And it's like, okay, well, it's rough."
4160580,4163220," Well, the answer is really simple."
4163220,4166580," The answer is reach out and ask."
4166580,4169860," And that I do also know people that do that right now."
4169860,4172820," And that's the worst part."
4172820,4183980," Like I have personally had content used in montages or like mashups or reaction videos"
4183980,4184980," or whatever."
4184980,4185980," Yeah."
4185980,4187980," Like someone brought up in FlowPlaneChat."
4187980,4193740," Gardener Bryant was a Linux creator that reacted to some of our Linux challenge videos."
4193740,4194740," I watched them."
4194740,4195740," I thought they were really good."
4195740,4196740," Yep."
4196740,4197740," Yeah."
4197740,4198740," Hold on."
4198740,4199740," Okay."
4199740,4200740," I'll get to that in a second."
4200740,4210300," Personally known of huge creators, like enormous creators that did not, did not have a valid"
4210300,4213100," fair use argument for their use of our content."
4213100,4214660," Gotcha."
4214660,4221060," And could have reached out like, like, like absolutely could have reached out or had their"
4221060,4222540," staff reach out."
4222540,4229180," Like I'm talking creators with a staff, you know, like Star Wars kid."
4229180,4233740," That's an old reference anyway."
4233740,4235100," And just didn't."
4235100,4237140," And that's just, that's just pure laziness."
4237140,4238140," Yeah."
4238140,4239220," Even people, even people I know."
4239220,4243660," So there's, there's a handful of creators that I have like a standing agreement with."
4243660,4250060," Like Austin, a Marquez for example, it's like, Hey, can we just have a mutual, like,"
4250060,4253580," if I need to use a clip from you and I'm like sure I'd like say it from you."
4253580,4254580," It's from you or whatever."
4254580,4258700," And if you use a clip from me and make sure that you do the same, can we just like, not"
4258700,4260420," email every time?"
4260420,4262860," Sure."
4262860,4265140," But that's, that's a positive."
4265140,4268420," That's a constructive way to build community."
4268420,4272460," Just taking stuff and being like, Oh, it'll probably benefit the moment."
4272460,4274900," Maybe that's not cool."
4274900,4276740," And it should never be acceptable."
4276740,4277940," And you know, you have to ask yourself."
4277940,4281420," Is one of the pillars of your reaction channel going to be that you reach out every time"
4281420,4282420," for every video?"
4282420,4283420," I think we should."
4283420,4284620," Yeah."
4284620,4286260," I think that we're speaking out against it."
4286260,4287620," So I think it would have to be right."
4287620,4289060," Well, it depends, right?"
4289060,4294340," So if you are reacting to, okay, so a perfect example of this would be the recent coffee"
4294340,4297220," Zilla Logan Paul controversy."
4297220,4303700," Logan Paul's not going to give coffee Zilla permission to utilize portions of his video."
4303700,4310900," But in that case, coffee Zilla is clearly transforming the original work."
4310900,4317580," That is not sitting and eating while the Logan Paul video plays as like a weird spectrum"
4317580,4319500," technical or whatever else."
4319500,4328780," So in the case of a clear and obvious fair use argument, I don't think we have to."
4328780,4329780," So we just have to."
4329780,4330780," So would you?"
4330780,4331780," Sorry."
4331780,4336540," Is that reaction channel going to cover divisive things like that?"
4336540,4338060," I don't know."
4338060,4339060," We're not sure."
4339060,4340060," What is it?"
4340060,4341140," Is it a tech reaction channel?"
4341140,4342140," Is it?"
4342140,4343980," So let's go."
4343980,4346140," Let's talk about some of the things we have in here."
4346140,4352380," So one of the things we could do is we've done a few of these on the main channel, reacting"
4352380,4358660," to community submissions, like best and worst builds and stuff like that, reacting to tech."
4358660,4359660," You can use submissions."
4359660,4360660," It's a totally different thing."
4360660,4362220," But it's reaction content."
4362220,4363220," But it's not."
4363220,4364220," It's ethical reaction content."
4364220,4367980," It's not reaction content in the way that the internet would interpret the term reaction"
4367980,4368980," content."
4368980,4369980," Really?"
4369980,4370980," Internet."
4370980,4373060," Would you consider that to be reaction content?"
4373060,4374340," I don't think they would."
4374340,4376660," Because if you say react, let's pull it."
4376660,4377660," Let's pull it."
4377660,4380180," I'm going to do my pole dance."
4380180,4382180," Oh my God."
4382180,4387540," You're going to get some reaction content from that."
4387540,4388620," They're going to side with you."
4388620,4390740," They're going to side with you even if I'm right."
4390740,4392100," Because you're wrong."
4392100,4393180," No."
4393180,4394940," It's reaction content."
4394940,4396620," Anyway."
4396620,4399180," It is reaction content by definition of the term."
4399180,4402740," It is not reaction content by how the internet interprets that."
4402740,4407860," If you say you are react channel, people are going to think that you're reacting to videos"
4407860,4410740," because that's how that works right now."
4410740,4414100," If it's user submitted videos that is seen as a different thing."
4414100,4415100," All right."
4415100,4416100," Let's see the poll results."
4416100,4418100," I'm working on a poll results."
4418100,4420940," Why don't you put up a poll smart guy?"
4420940,4422820," Because I'm typing it out."
4422820,4423820," Come on."
4423820,4424820," Okay."
4424820,4425820," So some other ideas."
4425820,4433940," I really love what corridor crew does where they will bring on experts to react to."
4433940,4440180," So that's actually that's such a good example of how you can take very obviously copyrighted"
4440180,4449300," work from very aggressive IP companies like like a Disney for example and confidently"
4449300,4455660," include stills or even motion from their content in your video."
4455660,4462420," Because if you are for example doing a detailed breakdown of how the CGI was done for a particular"
4462420,4466900," scene, you're sitting there, you're talking about how much work it was and how cool it"
4466900,4468180," was."
4468180,4470620," You are not using a substantial amount."
4470620,4475820," The effect on the original work is obviously positive."
4475820,4484460," The nature of your own work is clearly more informative and/or educational/factual."
4484460,4489140," And even though the nature of the copyrighted work is purely fictional, the way it is being"
4489140,4497460," transformed into something that is educational is very, very cut and dried."
4497460,4500060," So anyway, bringing in experts."
4500060,4503260," Something that I've wanted to do for a long time on the LTT channel, we just haven't gotten"
4503260,4504260," around to it."
4504260,4511100," I've gotten as far as an email to Wendell, SupWendell, is I want to do LTT reacts to"
4511100,4513060," bad hacking scenes and movies."
4513060,4515580," That would be amazing."
4515580,4517780," Is that react enough for you?"
4517780,4520620," That fits my term."
4520620,4521620," Right."
4521620,4522780," That's what I'm saying."
4522780,4523780," Is that acceptable?"
4523780,4526140," Or maybe not."
4526140,4528340," Is that under the umbrella of reaction content?"
4528340,4530420," I don't know if it is."
4530420,4532380," Okay."
4532380,4533380," That is common."
4533380,4537220," Oh, your poll is bad because it makes it seem like a binary choice."
4537220,4538420," Because I didn't include it both."
4538420,4539420," Oh, yeah."
4539420,4540780," Flowplane chat does not like it."
4540780,4542620," Yeah, because they want it both."
4542620,4543620," Okay."
4543620,4546820," But that defeats the whole point."
4546820,4547820," All right."
4547820,4551300," And they don't get that and you don't get that, but it defeats the whole point."
4551300,4554220," We want to do reacting to bad product listings."
4554220,4559220," So going through Facebook Marketplace, people who think their computer is worth way too"
4559220,4560220," much."
4560220,4564940," And I've told this before."
4564940,4565940," Tech memes."
4565940,4566940," Don't leave the question."
4566940,4567940," I didn't leave the question."
4567940,4569140," Reacting to old videos of ours."
4569140,4571660," Well, you've actually found that more people will click the top option."
4571660,4574740," I put the top option is not the one that I was saying."
4574740,4576060," Screw off."
4576060,4577060," They're right."
4577060,4578060," They don't like your poll, right?"
4578060,4579060," No, they're wrong."
4579060,4580060," They're all wrong."
4580060,4581580," The whole audience is wrong."
4581580,4583660," We've got reacting to old videos of ours."
4583660,4587080," So one of the suggestions was, \"Lioness finally watches what it's like to work for"
4587080,4589820," Liness and reacts to it,\" which I commented on."
4589820,4590820," I said, \"I won't do it.\""
4590820,4591820," But you said you never would."
4591820,4592820," Yeah."
4592820,4593820," I was like, \"No, we can't do that one."
4593820,4594820," That one's off limits.\""
4594820,4597160," But overall, that's not a bad idea."
4597160,4601500," Yeah, best and worst of TikTok, stuff like that."
4601500,4605540," But again, that's getting into the gray area unless we're doing a really good job of reaching"
4605540,4613320," out to people, which I will tell you right now for our trying TikTok hacks videos in the"
4613320,4614320," past."
4614320,4615920," I don't think we've reached out to people."
4615920,4620780," However, what we've done has been highly transformative."
4620780,4622280," We are actually doing things."
4622280,4623280," We're actually trying them."
4623280,4630820," I'm not eating a box of noodles while I watch other people's content."
4630820,4637300," So I think what it basically comes down to is just being ethical about it and adhering"
4637300,4643540," to the four pillars of fair use and making sure that regardless of who it is and whether"
4643540,4649400," they could afford to take us to court over it, making sure that we would have a strong"
4649400,4655400," fair use argument that we believe with certainty that we would win."
4655400,4656920," That's I think the bottom line."
4656920,4660720," And/or just getting permission from the original creator."
4660720,4662720," Right."
4662720,4669400," That's where we're at on it because at this point, you're stupid not to have a React channel."
4669400,4670760," It's kind of like a Clips channel."
4670760,4676100," And do you guys have any idea how long they pushed me around here to do a Clips channel"
4676100,4677100," for the Wanshow?"
4677100,4680140," Do you know how successful the Clips channel is?"
4680140,4682940," I think it makes more money than the actual Wanshow."
4682940,4683940," Probably."
4683940,4686700," Which is like, how does that even make any sense?"
4686700,4688580," It's just like must actually."
4688580,4689580," Yeah."
4689580,4692780," Because you're dividing it up into a bunch of content and each one of those content pieces"
4692780,4693780," is doing well."
4693780,4696620," LMG Clips gets 10 million views a month."
4696620,4697620," Yeah."
4697620,4700340," It is actually in terms of just overall viewership."
4700340,4707900," It is on par with like what I would consider to be like beats here tech channels."
4707900,4711920," And I'm sitting here going, how is that even how is it even possible?"
4711920,4715680," They know they can just they know they could just link to a timestamp in the Wanshow."
4715680,4719440," But that's not how people that's not how people engage with content."
4719440,4720880," They want it to be digestible."
4720880,4728160," And there's a huge contingent of our viewers that is absolutely just militantly opposed"
4728160,4731200," to watching long format content like the Wanshow."
4731200,4734760," But does want to hear about what we talk about on the Wanshow."
4734760,4738720," And I've said this before, like I'm not going to sit down and watch the whole Wanshow."
4738720,4739720," Oh yeah."
4739720,4740720," Yvonne's the same way."
4740720,4741720," Yeah."
4741720,4743440," She never looks at Wanshow."
4743440,4745560," But she's like, she'll devour Clips."
4745560,4746560," Clips are cool."
4746560,4748360," She's like, yeah, what are you talking about this week?"
4748360,4755280," And I've always understood why people like the, the timestamp guy in the description"
4755280,4756800," or in the pinned comment."
4756800,4757800," Yeah."
4757800,4761720," Because like, yeah, it's a really, especially lately, man."
4761720,4764680," We've had some like three hour, three and a half hour show."
4764680,4771040," Based on how many of our topics we've hit so far today, this is going to be a marathon."
4771040,4772040," You down, dad."
4772040,4778880," They get pretty intense of being able to sit down and watch the whole thing, especially"
4778880,4779880," in one sitting."
4779880,4781960," It's like half a half a work day."
4781960,4782960," And you know what?"
4782960,4785880," The reality of it is that a good title and thumbnail works."
4785880,4786880," But this is great."
4786880,4787880," This is great."
4787880,4793480," A prime in the float plane chat who is Alex, Alex P, one of our, one of our editors."
4793480,4795520," He goes, I watch WAN."
4795520,4797240," I edit tech tips."
4797240,4799120," I'm going to add something here."
4799120,4802920," I am really good at like creating YouTube thumbnails."
4802920,4808800," I am, I am literally like a, like a, a creator of the, of the drug, right?"
4808800,4810040," I'm a, I'm a dealer."
4810040,4811040," Yeah."
4811040,4815480," I still end up being clickbated into WAN clips."
4815480,4822560," It is literally content he has seen before from people he can talk."
4822560,4830200," Thinking time he wants who he works in the same building as, at least some of them."
4830200,4833760," And he still manages to click on it."
4833760,4834760," That's so funny."
4834760,4835760," I don't make the rules."
4835760,4836760," Right."
4836760,4842800," Like I don't, it comes back to that conversation about is it the algorithm or is it the audience?"
4842800,4844960," I don't determine what works."
4844960,4845960," Yeah."
4845960,4847760," You just have to kind of go with the flow."
4847760,4849360," You have to go with the flow."
4849360,4850840," You got to go with the flow."
4850840,4853240," So we're going to make a react channel."
4853240,4855960," We're also going to tell you about our sponsors."
4855960,4858800," Also names of things matter."
4858800,4860640," I was, I dove into this recently."
4860640,4864960," I was playing Tarkov with a Tarkov creator and he made a clip."
4864960,4869320," I killed a cheater in a game that we were playing in and he made a like YouTube short"
4869320,4870320," thing of it."
4870320,4877560," And he called it, first of all, his name is Goat Moth, but the goat, the Owen goat is"
4877560,4878560," a zero."
4878560,4879560," Okay."
4879560,4884240," Just like if you never want to be searchable ever, that's probably good."
4884240,4891800," And then he named the short, how to kill a gaming chair, assuming that people would understand"
4891800,4894720," the meme of like they're not cheating."
4894720,4896800," They must just have a really good gaming chair."
4896800,4905200," I'm like, man, man, like man, I'm not really in the game anymore, but, but, but."
4905200,4906960," Come on brother."
4906960,4910800," Boom roasted."
4910800,4914640," Anyways, okay."
4914640,4915640," Sponsors."
4915640,4921120," Oh, and then we're going to do the evil wheel or whatever this thing is called the wheel"
4921120,4922320," of pain of pain."
4922320,4923320," I still don't know what it is."
4923320,4924320," Don't worry about it."
4924320,4925320," Okay."
4925320,4929600," This brought to you today by Thorum."
4929600,4931680," Hey, cool."
4931680,4937480," Thorum hand makes wedding bands and rings from rare, unique materials."
4937480,4943120," They work with everything from whiskey barrels to antlers to Damascus steel to World War"
4943120,4947960," Two rifle stocks and even to dinosaur fossils."
4947960,4954200," The Aloha is made out of black tungsten carbide with a Hawaiian koa wood inlay."
4954200,4955920," Are you proposing to me?"
4955920,4957800," I mean, is it finally happening?"
4957800,4961480," I mean, if you say no, then no, I wasn't."
4961480,4963360," But if you say yes, I might let it happen."
4963360,4964360," Unless."
4964360,4967360," Not just check it out."
4967360,4970800," Hawaiian koa is regarded as one of the most beautiful timbers in the world and you'll"
4970800,4974640," have no worries of raster tarnishing thanks to the tungsten carbide."
4974640,4977040," Well, the rest of it."
4977040,4978040," Yeah."
4978040,4979480," Their selection is as unique as your taste."
4979480,4980480," Sorry."
4980480,4982040," I'm not, I'm not a ringsmith."
4982040,4987680," I just don't know what that part of the rig is called."
4987680,4991720," Their selection is as unique as your taste and one of the best parts."
4991720,4993680," It seemed to have fallen."
4993680,4994680," It looks good."
4994680,4995680," I lost it."
4995680,4999000," They make it easy to get a ring size or kit on their website to make figuring out what"
4999000,5000360," rings size fits you best."

5004840,5005840," band."
5005840,5007640," Oh, no, that's what it was."
5007640,5009720," I lost it."
5009720,5014120," It's a beautiful wooden ring box with over 10 years of experience and over 5,000 happy"

5033040,5034280," I don't remember the last time we worked with Audible."
5034280,5035280," It's good service though."

5078520,5081960," to get a spicy first one back, okay?"
5081960,5087280," I wouldn't recommend listening to audiobooks during, you know, bedroom activities, but"
5087280,5088280," you could."
5088280,5089280," You could."
5089280,5090280," You could."

5115560,5119400," I mean, you know what you could think of the queen."
5119400,5121720," Anywho, that's the footwear."
5121720,5126520," That's a reference to the pre-show."
5126520,5127520," Okay."
5127520,5128520," You'd have to be there."
5128520,5129520," Okay."
5129520,5130520," You'd have to be there."
5130520,5131520," Yeah."
5131520,5134120," The show's brought to you by floatplane where you can find the pre-show."
5134120,5135120," Yeah."
5135120,5136480," Both live and in VOD form."
5136480,5138760," It's the only place to find it in a VOD."
5138760,5139760," Yeah."

5145080,5149920," Their dual climate knit material keeps out water and keeps your feet warm in winter and"
5149920,5152240," cool during the summer."
5152240,5157520," I want to make it clear that absolutely nothing on earth is completely waterproof."
5157520,5161400," The Grand Canyon was created by water and if water can cut through, rocket can cut through"
5161400,5162760," a shoe."
5162760,5170280," But, but, Vessy does an excellent job of building their shoes out of materials that are about"
5170280,5172600," as waterproof as you can make a shoe."
5172600,5174520," That's the compromise we've landed on."
5174520,5177360," So the best thing about it though is you don't need to worry about the weather, whether"

5198760,5199760," What's the wheel?"
5199760,5200760," Tell me what the wheel."
5200760,5205120," Let's do the wheel of pain."
5205120,5207640," I don't know if this is going to be a regular segment."
5207640,5211640," I don't know if we're going to come up with like different segments or whatever else."
5211640,5219040," But basically, I asked for a wheel and I pitched kind of a fun idea for the show today."
5219040,5222200," We're going to play a game called Devil's Advocate."
5222200,5223200," Okay."
5223200,5225120," I feel like that's just how the show works."
5225120,5228040," No, but this way is a little different."
5228040,5229040," Okay?"
5229040,5232600," So, you are going to spin the wheel."
5232600,5233600," Okay."
5233600,5235760," And, I'm already excited."
5235760,5240280," Whatever boneheaded thing that happened in the world of tech this week."
5240280,5243320," Oh, apparently I'm supposed to spin the wheel."
5243320,5244320," Okay."
5244320,5245320," I will spin the wheel."
5245320,5246320," I'm not excited."
5246320,5247320," Well, let's take turns."
5247320,5248320," Okay."
5248320,5249320," We each get to spin the wheel."
5249320,5250320," Beautiful."
5250320,5251320," All right."
5251320,5255720," So, whatever boneheaded thing happened in the world of tech, you have to defend it."
5255720,5256720," Oh, okay."
5256720,5257720," Okay."
5257720,5258720," Okay."
5258720,5259720," So, the topic list for this week."
5259720,5260720," Oh, sorry, these topics?"
5260720,5261720," Yes."
5261720,5262720," Ah."
5262720,5264840," Is Twitter's ban on third party apps?"
5264840,5265840," Okay."
5265840,5272040," So, Apple TV's Terms of Service requiring a separate iOS device to accept them."
5272040,5273040," Okay."
5273040,5277920," Samsung's attempt to use patents to block refurbished screen imports."
5277920,5279800," AI art generators."
5279800,5283440," I feel like we should rule out AI art generators just because we've already talked about it"
5283440,5284440," on the show."
5284440,5287280," So, if it lands on that, we'll spin again."
5287280,5288280," Yeah."
5288280,5294480," And Wyoming's bill that was introduced to phase out EV sales by 2035."
5294480,5295480," Okay."
5295480,5296480," Okay."
5296480,5297480," Okay."
5297480,5298480," Okay."
5298480,5299480," Do you want to go first or should I go first?"
5299480,5302560," So, wait, what happens if the is the spinner defending it?"
5302560,5306880," The spinner will defend whatever topic comes up on the wheel of pain."
5306880,5308320," I don't care who goes first."
5308320,5309320," Okay."
5309320,5310320," Whatever works."
5310320,5311320," Go for it."
5311320,5312320," Okay."
5312320,5313320," Either way, right?"
5313320,5314320," Yeah."
5314320,5315320," I don't think."
5315320,5316320," Wow."
5316320,5317320," Really, that's your spin?"
5317320,5318320," That's weak."
5318320,5319320," Well, you can't spin it again."
5319320,5320320," I didn't see what it was."
5320320,5321320," So, it doesn't matter."
5321320,5322320," Well, they did."
5322320,5323320," You must."
5323320,5324320," Oh, no."
5324320,5329720," You must defend Twitter banning third party apps."
5329720,5331720," I feel like I should run through."
5331720,5333000," So, here's how we'll do it."
5333000,5334000," Sorry, guys."
5334000,5335000," This is our first time doing it."
5335000,5336000," We should talk about the topic."
5336000,5337160," I will run through the topic."
5337160,5338160," Okay."
5338160,5339160," Okay."
5339160,5340160," And then you will defend it."
5340160,5341520," Yeah, I like it."
5341520,5347680," Last Thursday, all or nearly all third party Twitter apps broke."
5347680,5352960," The same day, a clause was quietly added to its developer agreement banning the creation"
5352960,5358120," of a substitute or similar service to the Twitter application."
5358120,5362320," So in effect, I don't even remember some of the names of third party Twitter clients"
5362320,5364800," that I've used in the past, but I have used them."
5364800,5365800," Hootsuite."
5365800,5366800," Yeah, yeah, sure."
5366800,5367800," Okay."
5367800,5368800," Yeah."
5368800,5372520," In effect, tools like Hootsuite or no, there used to be like, okay, for example, on Windows"
5372520,5374960," phone, there wasn't a first party Twitter client."
5374960,5378920," There was like a third party one that just hooked into the API and made it, you know,"
5378920,5382840," it wasn't great, but it was usable."
5382840,5389280," After a long silence, Twitter has announced that it was simply enforcing its longstanding"
5389280,5394440," API rules, which may result in some apps not working."
5394440,5399200," Twitter has not responded to any questions about which longstanding rules were broken."
5399200,5400600," Well, they don't have a peer department."
5400600,5405720," Questions that were posed by prominent members of the tech community, like our, our friend"
5405720,5414880," over at MKBHD, one, Mark has Keith Brownlee in high definition."
5414880,5420520," In 2021, Twitter had actually removed a clause discouraging, but not banning third party"
5420520,5427440," apps as a way of building a warmer relationship with these developers."
5427440,5431520," In other news, Twitter is now being sued by a consulting firm claiming that it has not"
5431520,5435200," been paid for services rendered to Twitter during its lawsuit to force Musk to follow"
5435200,5436800," through on his purchase of the company."
5436800,5437800," That's really funny."
5437800,5438800," Okay."
5438800,5440880," We'll talk about that more later."
5440880,5443160," That's really, really funny."
5443160,5444120," Anyway, okay."
5444120,5451480," I think you saw, isn't there one more thing?"
5451480,5452480," Nope."
5452480,5454520," Oh, that's just not very interesting."
5454520,5456520," Okay."
5456520,5459680," Twitter is going through a re-facing right now."
5459680,5460680," It has a new CEO."
5460680,5461800," It has a lot of new employees."
5461800,5463440," It has a lot less total employees."
5463440,5465120," Does it have a lot of new employees?"
5465120,5466120," I believe so."
5466120,5467120," Don't they?"
5467120,5468120," Didn't they?"
5468120,5469120," Are they hiring?"
5469120,5470120," Twitter?"
5470120,5471120," Yeah."
5471120,5472120," Twitter."
5472120,5473120," Yeah."
5473120,5474120," Didn't they let go like 75% of their workflows?"
5474120,5475120," Yeah, I think they're also hiring."
5475120,5476120," Okay."
5476120,5477120," Yeah."
5477120,5478120," Okay."
5478120,5479120," So they've got new employees."
5479120,5480120," Okay."
5480120,5481120," What did that have to do with any employees?"
5481120,5482120," They have some new employees."
5482120,5483120," Oh, yeah."
5483120,5484120," Did I mention that the other person is allowed to poke holes in your defense the whole time?"
5484120,5485120," Sure."
5485120,5486120," Yeah."
5486120,5487120," I haven't made one yet."
5487120,5488120," Okay."
5488120,5489120," So maybe you can sit the F down."
5489120,5493120," This is going to be so hard."
5493120,5495880," No, you have to be straight faced."
5495880,5497200," You're not allowed to acknowledge it."
5497200,5498200," All right."
5498200,5499200," Yeah."
5499200,5500200," Okay."
5500200,5502200," So yeah, they have a new face and they need to be able to control their image because"
5502200,5504120," their image matters, right?"
5504120,5508320," And having all these third party apps running around, making custom experiences that are"
5508320,5512280," different to what they are trying to tailor make for the audience could be bad for the"
5512280,5513280," platform."
5513280,5516400," And they should enforce various rules that they have."
5516400,5518760," You shouldn't just set rules and then not enforce them."
5518760,5523040," It can be frustrating to be on a platform where the rules are really loosey, goosey and"
5523040,5526520," they get applied to some people in a certain way and other people in a certain way."
5526520,5529920," It's a lot easier if it's very clear what you can and cannot do."
5529920,5531880," So if rules exist, it should be enforced."
5531880,5532880," No, no, no."
5532880,5537480," I have to stop you right there because it's obviously not clear what rules, what rules"
5537480,5539320," are trying to make it clear."
5539320,5540840," No, they're not trying to make it clear."
5540840,5541840," They're not responding."
5541840,5544160," Oh, they don't have a yard of work when people."
5544160,5545320," But that's not part of the debate."
5545320,5546960," So it's okay."
5546960,5548160," No."
5548160,5554880," That is not okay because a key foundational piece of your argument is that they are trying"
5554880,5556640," to improve the clarity of their rules."
5556640,5557840," Yeah, by enforcing them."
5557840,5559720," By enforcing them."
5559720,5564920," But if no one can figure out what rules are being violated, then they obviously aren't"
5564920,5565920," clear enough."
5565920,5567720," Oh, just don't make third party apps."
5567720,5569080," Just don't make third party apps."
5569080,5571160," That's not a defense of it."
5571160,5572560," That's the conclusion of it."
5572560,5574840," Yeah, but that's okay."
5574840,5576440," So you're just saying it's okay."
5576440,5577440," Yeah."
5577440,5579440," That's all you got."
5579440,5582560," I think it's fine."
5582560,5586080," Twitter doesn't, Twitter doesn't want you to make third party apps."
5586080,5587720," So don't make third party apps."
5587720,5588720," It seems pretty clear to me."
5588720,5593200," I don't see why they would need a PR department because the answer is very obvious."
5593200,5594200," Don't make third party apps."
5594200,5595200," I see."
5595200,5599680," And just to kind of bring us back a little bit to your argument that Twitter is concerned"
5599680,5603480," about the image that it presents to the rest of the world, of course, and the damage that"
5603480,5606640," third party apps could do to it."
5606640,5610920," I mean, do I even have to explain how wrong that is?"
5610920,5611920," Twitter is doing all--"
5611920,5613960," They're trying to release new features."
5613960,5616040," They're trying to release new functionality."
5616040,5620480," And if these third party apps don't support those features and functionality, then those"
5620480,5622240," aren't going to get to the users."
5622240,5628400," The image, the way that people interpret and use Twitter could be deeply affected by these"
5628400,5632880," third party apps, not responding and reflecting the experience that Twitter is trying to create"
5632880,5634080," for its users."
5634080,5636200," So maybe they just shouldn't exist."
5636200,5639440," And if it follows the rules to get rid of them, well, they should get rid of them because"
5639440,5641200," they should enforce their rules."
5641200,5642200," I see."
5642200,5649640," So if your goal in life is to have your product be as much of a dumpster fire as possible,"
5649640,5654840," then you are well within your rights to ensure that every user who interacts with it experiences"
5654840,5655840," the full dumpster fire."
5655840,5661080," I wouldn't word it that way, but they are fully within their rights, correct?"
5661080,5663080," Okay."
5663080,5669000," Your argument boils down to legally there within their rights."
5669000,5670000," That is a true state."
5670000,5672600," I again wouldn't word it that way, but that is a true statement."
5672600,5676880," Again, they're creating new features."
5676880,5680640," I believe there's-- I'm not super familiar with Twitter features, but I believe there's"
5680640,5683080," new home feed."
5683080,5685200," I believe there's new feeds in your home."
5685200,5686200," I don't know."
5686200,5687200," Okay."
5687200,5688600," I don't know Twitter features very well."
5688600,5691720," But if the third party apps don't reflect that, and that's a big thing that they want"
5691720,5696160," to push because they have this massive wave of new users, so clearly they're doing something"
5696160,5702680," right, and their servers have not gone down despite everyone saying that they would, they"
5702680,5708320," want to push Twitter in a new direction, and you don't want third party people controlling"
5708320,5712040," what direction your platform is able to go in, which they're able to do."
5712040,5713040," Imagine you were releasing videos."
5713040,5714040," All right."
5714040,5718480," You started releasing a new type of video, but some third party thing was just like, we're"
5718480,5722520," just not going to release that type of video whenever they release it."
5722520,5724840," Would that annoy you as a video creator?"
5724840,5726520," But what about user choice?"
5726520,5728120," Would it annoy you as a video creator?"
5728120,5733240," As a video creator, if someone created a curated feed of my videos--"
5733240,5735400," If you started making a new type of content--"
5735400,5736400," No."
5736400,5739200," --and that's the reason-- no, and that's the reason that Twitter has engaged with these"
5739200,5744960," third party apps over the course of their entire history is because overall, they benefit"
5744960,5748760," from a broader ecosystem compared to a closed, more narrow one."
5748760,5750240," If you were using Twitch--"
5750240,5751240," Sure."
5751240,5755320," --and you make a fix to-- say Twitch does more things than it does."
5755320,5758480," Say Twitch actually was successful when they tried to do vods."
5758480,5759480," Sure."
5759480,5762560," Shots fired."
5762560,5769320," And you started releasing a new type of review content, and it's compatible with Twitch, but"
5769320,5771640," Twitch just decides to not upgrade."
5771640,5772640," I don't know."
5772640,5774440," Say it's like AV1 or something."
5774440,5776720," And Twitch doesn't update."
5776720,5780680," So a bunch of users on Twitch are now unable to view those videos."
5780680,5786520," But you've curated a massive user base on Twitch that sees your standard content."
5786520,5790520," So now you have these weird segmented content because you have some stuff that's going on."
5790520,5795680," And all the stuff that can't go on Twitch because they're refusing to update their platform."
5795680,5802640," And if that third party platform doesn't update, then obviously they're going to shed users"
5802640,5803640," through natural attrition."
5803640,5807240," So you can't communicate to those users directly about this."
5807240,5813160," Communication to those users is controlled by that platform."
5813160,5814720," Why is this a good thing for you?"
5814720,5816960," There's no benefit."
5816960,5817960," The benefit is--"
5817960,5818960," So kill all."
5818960,5819960," So kill all the apps."
5819960,5820960," So kill all the apps."
5820960,5822960," So you can actually control feature functionality."
5822960,5823960," All right."
5823960,5828280," So the last new rule I'm going to add to this segment is that we're going to have to add"
5828280,5830280," a time limit because that took too long."
5830280,5831280," Okay, fair enough."
5831280,5835200," Two, our adjudicator will be Dan."
5835200,5841120," So Dan, can you give Luke a rating out of 10 for his defense of Twitter just cutting"
5841120,5843480," off third party apps?"
5843480,5844480," I don't know."
5844480,5845480," That did seem pretty weak."
5845480,5849280," I'm probably going to give you a three out of 10 because they're legally allowed to do"
5849280,5850280," it."
5850280,5853680," Like, no, that's kind of weak."
5853680,5855680," That wasn't my argument."
5855680,5859400," Well, if your argument wasn't clear, then it's still a three out of 10 defense."
5859400,5862000," Okay, I need to make sure that I just completely--"
5862000,5865480," Oh, you do the thing that you don't like."
5865480,5866480," Oh."
5866480,5868360," What did I do?"
5868360,5869800," I need to shadow ban minus."
5869800,5872680," What did I do?"
5872680,5875440," It just wasn't my argument and that you said that it was."
5875440,5876440," I did say it was."
5876440,5877440," Which is what you did."
5877440,5878440," Yeah, you did."
5878440,5879440," When?"
5879440,5880440," Just now the dance in it."
5880440,5881720," He regurgitated what you said."
5881720,5883960," Well, that was the argument you were making at the time."
5883960,5884960," No, it wasn't."
5884960,5885960," Fine."
5885960,5886960," That was when I was paying attention."
5886960,5888840," I was saying if they're going to have rules, they should enforce them."
5888840,5891440," I wasn't saying that it's legally within their rights."
5891440,5894320," Yeah, but they haven't made these rules clear."
5894320,5897280," They don't seem to have them."
5897280,5901680," If they had these rules, then they should reply and say what the rules are."
5901680,5906520," But it's clear that they don't want anyone to know what the rules are because then they"
5906520,5910920," might be able to adjust their third party apps to adhere to the rules."
5910920,5913520," I think they just don't want third party apps."
5913520,5917360," And that's fair enough."
5917360,5923160," But to say that they want clarity in their rules, that's a bad argument."
5923160,5924680," I didn't say they want clarity."
5924680,5925680," You did say that."
5925680,5926980," I said they want to enforce them."
5926980,5929120," This is going to be a great segment."
5929120,5930120," It's already great."
5930120,5931120," I'm already angry."
5931120,5934280," Yeah, I don't think I've seen him misfire it up in forever."
5934280,5935280," I can talk again."
5935280,5937440," I got a lot of pent up energy."
5937440,5941040," Okay, so I mean, yeah, they don't want apps, right, Luke?"
5941040,5942040," But yeah."
5942040,5946360," But why shouldn't they allow apps if it dilutes their brand?"
5946360,5949160," Because they're worse than what Twitter's making."
5949160,5950160," Yes."
5950160,5951160," Yeah."
5951160,5952160," Oh, come on."
5952160,5953160," I mean, that's come on."
5953160,5954960," Okay, Dan, you still have to rate it."
5954960,5955960," We still have to move on."
5955960,5957560," I just been I'll be open you up."
5957560,5960120," There's a poll on the Twitter argument and I'm winning."
5960120,5961120," Four out of 10."
5961120,5962120," 67% of the time."
5962120,5963120," All right, you managed to get an extra point."
5963120,5964120," Are you happy?"
5964120,5965120," Extra point."
5965120,5966120," Four out of 10."
5966120,5968360," I'm going to burn this court to the ground."
5968360,5969360," All right."
5969360,5972840," I'll put a timer and I'll make some things for next time."
5972840,5973840," Okay, cool."
5973840,5974840," It'll be fancy."
5974840,5977320," The real main reason for it."
5977320,5980840," Yes, it boils down to they simply don't want third party apps."
5980840,5982360," There's nothing to do with the rules."
5982360,5985720," It has nothing to do with any kind of."
5985720,5987640," What if the rules that there's no third party apps?"
5987640,5988880," It has nothing to do with any."
5988880,5990080," Well, that isn't though."
5990080,5995800," It has nothing to do with any kind of benefit of having a smaller ecosystem other than that"
5995800,6002440," many third party apps do not display ads."
6002440,6009240," So Twitter is trying desperately, desperately to something."
6009240,6010240," I don't know."
6010240,6011240," Was that not defendable?"
6011240,6014000," I feel like that would be easier to defend than what I just defended."
6014000,6015000," It could be."
6015000,6016000," It could be."
6016000,6018360," Because now you're fighting against your own argument."
6018360,6022840," Sure, but you're also fighting against your own partners and your own users."
6022840,6025600," Your partners, you have."
6025600,6028000," You're defending adblock."
6028000,6029000," So no."
6029000,6030000," Yeah."
6030000,6031000," What you could do."
6031000,6033840," You can't send ads and it uses Twitter's service."
6033840,6037160," There's a correct way to update your API rules."
6037160,6044240," The correct way is you give a time window for compliance and you create transparent,"
6044240,6046160," well communicated rules."
6046160,6049640," And those transparent, well communicated rules include, hey, you have to display ads at the"
6049640,6051440," same rate that the original Twitter app does."
6051440,6053320," Unless they don't want the pretty apps at all."
6053320,6055000," Unless they just don't want third party apps."
6055000,6063560," Which is, I mean ultimately what you said, which is right, but it's not a defense."
6063560,6067640," It's a statement of fact, but it's not a defense."
6067640,6069200," It's still crappy."
6069200,6070360," It's bad partnership."
6070360,6073040," It's bad management."
6073040,6074320," Now I get to play."
6074320,6075320," Sure."
6075320,6076320," All right."
6076320,6077320," I'm only familiar with some of these topics."
6077320,6079560," I don't want to get a final statement."
6079560,6080760," Is it this?"
6080760,6083600," Oh, it's the AI or generators one."
6083600,6084600," Okay, I'll try again."
6084600,6085840," Yeah, this is hard to spin."
6085840,6087400," I shouldn't have made fun of your weak spin."
6087400,6089080," Because the monitor, the screens are in the hole."
6089080,6090080," Any better."
6090080,6091080," Bloody hell."
6091080,6092080," Did I just get AI art generation again?"
6092080,6093080," I'm, yeah, I did."
6093080,6094080," I'm crying a lot."
6094080,6095080," I'll give it a proper."
6095080,6096840," Let's get away from the screens."
6096840,6097840," Yeah."
6097840,6098840," There you go."
6098840,6099840," There we go."
6099840,6100840," Let's go."
6100840,6101840," Okay."
6101840,6102840," Oh, no."
6102840,6103840," What is it?"
6103840,6106480," Oh, Samsung screen patent."
6106480,6108560," Okay, Luke, tell us about it."
6108560,6110920," I got to find it once."
6110920,6116560," Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, where is it?"
6116560,6118240," I guess we can control it."
6118240,6120920," Yeah, it's in the dock."
6120920,6128400," It's in the dock."
6128400,6132960," Hm."
6132960,6139660," For next time in the section of devil's advocate, the topic list should be hyperlinked."
6139660,6140660," Yes."
6140660,6141660," There's, you know what?"
6141660,6143440," There's a lot of things that we could do better."
6143440,6144640," We're just, it's a small thing."
6144640,6145640," I wasn't really."
6145640,6146640," We're trying stuff, right?"
6146640,6147640," Yeah."
6147640,6151940," Like we want to, we want to kind of try to, we want to kind of try to, without losing"
6151940,6158840," track of what the win show is, we want to kind of try and find some novel ways to engage"
6158840,6160880," with these topics is basically the goal here."
6160880,6162000," I hope you guys are enjoying it."
6162000,6164920," I am actually, like, man, he's getting fired up."
6164920,6165920," I like it."
6165920,6169840," So this is the reason why I couldn't find it was this is the US farmers win right to"
6169840,6176840," repair argument or right to repair farm equipment while Samsung undermines independent screen"
6176840,6177840," repair."
6177840,6182500," There's been a bunch of posts in float plane chat that this isn't legit."
6182500,6187340," We'll see through how this is written, how legit that we say it is."
6187340,6188340," Okay."
6188340,6192500," But people are saying that apparently this John Deere didn't actually do that."
6192500,6195700," And Lewis Rossman has a video about it."
6195700,6196700," Then I guess we'll, okay."
6196700,6197700," Sure."
6197700,6198700," We'll see what the notes say them."
6198700,6199700," Yeah."
6199700,6201640," For our new notes creator."
6201640,6202640," Yeah."
6202640,6206820," This month, John Deere signed a memorandum of understanding with the American Farm Bureau"
6206820,6208780," and agricultural lobbyists."
6208780,6210140," Oh, great."
6210140,6215620," Acknowledging the American farmers, God given right to fix their own equipment, including"
6215620,6218580," bringing it to independent repair facilities."
6218580,6223360," The move follows years of efforts by John Deere to lock down its products, which make"
6223360,6227920," up over 50% of the US tractors and combines market."
6227920,6236300," This have long reported huge delays during planting and harvesting due to repair times."
6236300,6241140," There is hope that this memorandum might act as a framework for future law, but similar"
6241140,6245840," to New York's recent right to repair legislation, these kinds of agreements are often riddled"
6245840,6247240," with caveats and loopholes."
6247240,6251900," I do believe that's like the issue."
6251900,6256020," Voluntary standards are not enforceable and the language of the memorandum is vague."
6256020,6257900," Oh, that's an issue."
6257900,6258900," Right."
6258900,6260800," So I'm not allowed to say anything."
6260800,6266540," In 2018, John Deere signed a similar agreement with the California Farm Bureau to limited"
6266540,6271720," effect and John Deere has agreed to provide its repair tools for sale as well as granting"
6271720,6275400," access to manuals, product guides and diagnostic codes."
6275400,6276400," Okay."
6276400,6280200," Meanwhile, and I think this is the actual part that we're talking about because I think"
6280200,6281360," this just said Samsung."
6281360,6282360," Yeah, I did."
6282360,6283360," Okay."
6283360,6287760," So meanwhile, Samsung is now attempting to use an old OLED patent to get certain aftermarket"
6287760,6293420," and refurbished device screens banned from import into the United States."
6293420,6299760," Thanks to buy underscore mu, M-I-E-W, mu, who posted a link to this on the LCD form."
6299760,6304220," This would restrict buyers from getting their phones repaired solely from the original vendor"
6304220,6309180," or licensed partners, which means the company can simply refuse to fix it."
6309180,6313940," Samsung argues that this proposed ban is in part to protect consumers from inferior or"
6313940,6316500," defective products."
6316500,6321580," Samsung has also added some tools and parts to its self repair program with IFixit for"
6321580,6327620," Galaxy S22 phones and some Galaxy laptops."
6327620,6328620," Some tools and parts."
6328620,6330740," Who knows if it's all of them."
6330740,6334960," There are still tons of devices that aren't covered and the program appears to focus primarily"
6334960,6341300," on flagship products from the last three years, excluding easily broken foldables and popular"
6341300,6343220," budget models."
6343220,6347700," The replacement screen for the Galaxy S22 lineup comes bundled with the replacement battery"
6347700,6349300," and frame."
6349300,6354700," It is not available separately and tons of other parts just aren't available at all."
6354700,6357740," Do we do the discussion topics when we do these things?"
6357740,6359740," Nope, I don't think so."
6359740,6361700," I don't think so either."
6361700,6362860," Okay, I get to go now."
6362860,6363860," Yes."
6363860,6371820," I think this one is actually pretty simple to defend."
6371820,6372820," And the reason for that."
6372820,6374740," Nice as intro."
6374740,6378340," Is that, well I'm buying time obviously."
6378340,6380180," I know."
6380180,6389660," Okay, the reason for that is that as you made an argument for very recently actually, I"
6389660,6390660," am Samsung, right?"
6390660,6392700," So I'm taking on the role of Samsung."
6392700,6396500," So I am well within my right to defend my patent."
6396500,6401100," If someone has a problem with my patent and thinks that for whatever reason they should"
6401100,6407220," be able to import their own inferior or knock off products that violate it, well then the"
6407220,6408940," correct legal process for them to go through."
6408940,6409940," Is this defending a patent?"
6409940,6411820," It didn't say anything about defending a patent."
6411820,6412820," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
6412820,6417740," They're using their OLED patent to get aftermarket and refurbished device screens banned from"
6417740,6419380," importing to the US."
6419380,6425220," And so if I hold a patent on these devices, well at the end of the day, I have to defend"
6425220,6432180," my patent and besides, there should be no reason that a user who purchased an authentic Samsung"
6432180,6439980," device made up out of completely authentic Samsung parts should want an inferior part."
6439980,6440980," Why would they?"
6440980,6443180," If they wanted an inferior part, well then they could."
6443180,6444300," It's irrelevant what they want."
6444300,6446380," Well then they could go buy something from some other vendor."
6446380,6448620," You shouldn't be deciding what the user wants."
6448620,6452060," Well I know what they want because they bought a Samsung phone."
6452060,6453500," You still don't get to decide what they want."
6453500,6456700," But they didn't want to compromise on quality in the first place, so why would they want"
6456700,6458260," to now?"
6458260,6459260," Maybe their opinion is changed."
6459260,6462900," You don't get to decide that their opinion or stance on things changes."
6462900,6463900," Phones are also extremely-"
6463900,6465420," You phone your users."
6465420,6467100," Phones are just on your patent."
6467100,6469660," Phones are extremely intricate devices."
6469660,6470660," They are complex."
6470660,6473900," They are difficult to repair and here's the thing."
6473900,6477260," I don't believe that the difficulty of repair should actually judge anything."
6477260,6481980," Our entire lives are essentially tied to our phones."
6481980,6489300," We run off of our phones and so if there is a risk that the user could, thinking that"
6489300,6494780," they are getting a Samsung part, not ultimately get a brand new, authentic, fully functioning"
6494780,6497780," Samsung part, they could actually end up in a-"
6497780,6499060," Was that part of the argument either?"
6499060,6503980," I don't think there's any like duping the users about it being a Samsung part."
6503980,6509060," I would make the argument that the duping does not necessarily have to be done by the"
6509060,6510980," manufacturer of the part."
6510980,6511980," I think that it's-"
6511980,6513660," Are you like repair shops going into this genuine?"
6513660,6520900," As soon as you make these janky parts available to budget repair shops, I think it is as likely"
6520900,6524860," that these repair shops will pass along the discount as it is that these repair shops"
6524860,6529140," will misrepresent the product as a genuine Samsung product."
6529140,6535260," That creates a tarnish on the Samsung brand when users ultimately start to perceive Samsung"
6535260,6539940," as less performance and less reliable."
6539940,6546020," The other bit, and this is really important, is that sure, you can attack the limited devices"
6546020,6551780," that we're providing our self-service repair and our parts for, but I think it's pretty"
6551780,6558380," clear that for these older devices, it probably doesn't make economic sense for people to go"
6558380,6563580," and repair them anyway, given that we have great new phones available like the A-series"
6563580,6564580," where you can get-"
6564580,6567820," I don't think it's up to you to decide what is worth repairing and not worth repairing"
6567820,6568820," these issues."
6568820,6571540," I'm also allowed to make counterarguments."
6571540,6572540," Okay, we have a great-"
6572540,6577100," So I do believe that if you want to enforce this level of patent that you should make"
6577100,6582220," available all parts needed to repair said phones, and I do believe that they should not"
6582220,6583220," have to be bundled."
6583220,6586420," I don't think you should have to buy a frame for a phone when you actually just need to"
6586420,6587420," replace a screen."
6587420,6589140," Sure, but here's the issue with that."
6589140,6595140," For us to build these products to a standard of quality that our customers expect, it's"
6595140,6600260," not economically viable when the reality of it is when we're mass producing them, we"
6600260,6606580," can deliver a great quality product like the A-series that is functionally not even"
6606580,6609620," that much more expensive than if you were to just buy a display."
6609620,6613100," Now you've got a brand new device with a great camera, great display."
6613100,6616500," As a part of your mass manufacturing, you can just create additional screens."
6616500,6619260," Brand new battery, well, we don't have the line spun up for these old phones anymore."
6619260,6620780," Why would we were not making them?"
6620780,6622660," Create more in the first place."
6622660,6623660," But we didn't do that."
6623660,6624660," It's too late."
6624660,6626340," Commit to doing that in the future."
6626340,6629820," Well, we can talk about that in the future, but for now we haven't."
6629820,6630820," As for foldables."
6630820,6633220," I think as a part, if you want to push this bill through, I think it's a part—"
6633220,6634220," Are you letting me finish?"
6634220,6635220," No."
6635220,6636220," I'm allowed to make counterarguments."
6636220,6642140," I think if you want to push this through, we will have to make some form of agreement"
6642140,6647140," that you would over-manufacture parts in the future as would be expected from a company"
6647140,6653540," that is going to service warranties anyways by saying that you can fix these phones directly."
6653540,6655700," You are saying that you have these parts on hand."
6655700,6657580," I'm not saying you can fix the phones."
6657580,6659020," The average user is an idiot."
6659020,6662820," No, you're saying that you don't seem to be understanding my argument."
6662820,6664260," I think you might be one of them."
6664260,6666460," You can't get a girl there."
6666460,6670380," Finally, you're saying that you can fix the phones, which means that you have the parts."
6670380,6673140," The argument of not having the part is completely useless."
6673140,6674340," But the costs are high."
6674340,6676260," Sure, but you're saying that you can fix the phone."
6676260,6677260," But there's storage costs."
6677260,6678260," You have the part."
6678260,6679260," Right."
6679260,6680260," And there's training costs."
6680260,6681260," So charge the users."
6681260,6682620," And we have to build the tools."
6682620,6684020," We have to build the program for this."
6684020,6685180," It's going to take time."
6685180,6686180," Finally."
6686180,6687180," Actually, none of that makes any sense."
6687180,6689660," There's no training costs to train users to fix their own phones."
6689660,6693620," Oh, you have to create the program where they are trained to do it."
6693620,6694620," Absolutely."
6694620,6695620," No, you don't."
6695620,6696620," Apple did it."
6696620,6697820," Do they charge people for it?"
6697820,6699860," No, but you have to do it."
6699860,6701980," It's a fixed cost associated with running the program."
6701980,6703740," You absolutely have to do it."
6703740,6705620," A self-repair program."
6705620,6707620," Just sell it through iFixit."
6707620,6709380," Well we are selling parts through iFixit."
6709380,6712500," It's just more and an individual component instead of packages."
6712500,6713860," It's going to take time."
6713860,6718100," Besides, you've got to understand a lot of the sourcing for the components of a phone"
6718100,6720220," is not done individually."
6720220,6721780," Like even at the factory."
6721780,6722780," Okay."
6722780,6724900," Yeah, but you sell a screen as a component."
6724900,6726380," It's going to have the connector cable."
6726380,6727380," It's going to have everything else in."
6727380,6728380," Sure."
6728380,6730980," Look, you work for this channel Linus Tech Tips or something like that, right?"
6730980,6731980," Technically no."
6731980,6732980," Okay, so they did."
6732980,6735180," Yeah, maybe not anymore."
6735180,6739220," I haven't fired Luke in a while."
6739220,6743300," Okay, they did a video where they toured the factory of one of our competitors where you"
6743300,6750700," could plainly see that on the factory floor components are actually coming in as assemblies."
6750700,6756180," We're not going to take finished assemblies and then break them apart into their constituent"
6756180,6759260," components for these repair programs."
6759260,6763900," At the very most you could possibly expect, we would provide the same assemblies that"
6763900,6764900," we use."
6764900,6766340," Right now we're currently talking about a screen, correct?"
6766340,6767660," Yeah, but a screen."
6767660,6771780," So a screen would be one unit at one point in time in that process, correct?"
6771780,6776380," Not necessarily because I mean, you got to understand like with global manufacturing"
6776380,6783300," that screen factory that is creating the assemblies, that is not like a shipping end"
6783300,6789180," point for this supply chain that goes to a factory as an assembly."
6789180,6790620," You can repair a phone."
6790620,6791620," Yes."
6791620,6793140," If I send you one of my samples."
6793140,6794340," We will use an assembly."
6794340,6795340," Okay."
6795340,6796340," We will use an assembly."
6796340,6797340," So sell an assembly."
6797340,6800500," Well, but I'm only talking about this because you told me not to sell assemblies."
6800500,6802940," I don't think I said anything about an assembly."
6802940,6804540," Well, let the audience be the judge of that."
6804540,6808340," The package that includes a frame and whatnot else I don't think is the assembly that you're"
6808340,6809340," describing."
6809340,6810460," Well, it depends."
6810460,6813100," That assembly may be very fragile."
6813100,6815540," And there could be a high chance that the user would damage it."
6815540,6817740," It's going to have to be handled on a case by case basis."
6817740,6818740," No."
6818740,6825380," Anyway, my final point, if I can finally make it is that we're going to have to handle"
6825380,6829140," these things case by case and as for foldables, I don't believe you have to handle them"
6829140,6830140," case by case."
6830140,6832620," Okay, I really do need to get this last point out so that we can get through the segment."
6832620,6833620," Okay."
6833620,6841900," As for foldables, we don't need replacement screens A because they are basically functionally"
6841900,6846540," impossible to replace and B, they are flexible displays."
6846540,6848540," How could you possibly break it?"
6848540,6849540," There."
6849540,6850540," I rest my case."
6850540,6853860," That's a manufacturing defect."
6853860,6855860," You fix a folding phone?"
6855860,6860740," If a user has an issue with it and sends you a folding phone, I'm talking to you as I'm"
6860740,6862300," I'm Samsung the character right now."
6862300,6863540," I legitimately don't know."
6863540,6864540," Okay."
6864540,6865780," I actually don't know if they'd be able to."
6865780,6866780," They're quite fused."
6866780,6867780," No, I know."
6867780,6868780," Yeah."
6868780,6869780," Yeah."
6869780,6870780," Okay."
6870780,6874540," Well, great points for playing the character of Samsung."
6874540,6877340," I was shaking and angry that whole time."
6877340,6880580," I hate you so much."
6880580,6881580," You did it."
6881580,6882580," Yes."
6882580,6885020," Excellent job."
6885020,6889020," Embodying Samsung and all of the talking points that I can see them making, which are"
6889020,6891020," all disgusting and God."
6891020,6894020," Oh, my cheeks are."
6894020,6895020," Yeah."
6895020,6900780," So you certainly get a bunch more points for root."
6900780,6902340," Well I didn't feel like you were Twitter."
6902340,6903980," You didn't make me feel like you were Twitter."
6903980,6906780," Do you know what I mean?"
6906780,6907780," But yeah, I don't know."
6907780,6914780," Arguments are weak and I think I would have preferred to have a take that was why Linus"
6914780,6918580," would want to protect his phones."
6918580,6925220," Like if a creator warehouse made a phone, why you would lock them down with serial number"
6925220,6927460," and ID in the screen."
6927460,6928460," I see."
6928460,6929460," Okay."
6929460,6930460," Well, you got to give me a score."
6930460,6931460," You're getting a six."
6931460,6932460," I got a six."
6932460,6935460," You got a six because I almost cried."
6935460,6938700," Oh, I would just like to fix things."
6938700,6942940," What would it take to get like a nine?"
6942940,6944420," Well, let's see."
6944420,6948340," A nine to me would be your points are like."
6948340,6951900," That was pretty, I felt like he had me on the ropes for a little while there."
6951900,6952900," Oh yeah."
6952900,6953900," No, absolutely."
6953900,6956340," And then I had some ways to throw back."
6956340,6957780," But like what would he have to do?"
6957780,6961700," Like what would that argument need to look like to be a nine?"
6961700,6965660," I think you would probably have to make a good case for it."
6965660,6969660," I think it might be impossible inherently because the segments is called, actually I"
6969660,6971940," don't know if I ever told you guys what it's called."
6971940,6974740," It's called defend the indefensible."
6974740,6977500," That's what the version of the wheel of pain is."
6977500,6980700," So you would have to actually actually wind and over."
6980700,6982100," Yeah, I mean, not necessarily."
6982100,6983580," So I have my own biases."
6983580,6987380," I can extremely biased against that entire topic, right?"
6987380,6990580," But for you, there is no nine basically is what I'm trying to get to."
6990580,6991940," I don't think there should be."
6991940,6993660," If there was a way."
6993660,6994660," And that's fine."
6994660,6999740," I mean, if there was a reason for Linus to come up with that would make sense."
6999740,7003180," Like I don't know, even locking down the batteries, you're not allowed to open your"
7003180,7007620," phone because you're going to destroy the battery and you're going to blow up your"
7007620,7008620," house."
7008620,7009620," Yeah."
7009620,7011460," You know, liability issues, that sort of thing."
7011460,7017020," There's no eventual argument I think you could find for these topics."
7017020,7018020," And that's yeah."
7018020,7025500," Yeah, I think I think that a well designed defend the indefensible should never have should"
7025500,7028500," never have a nine out of 10 or a 10 out of 10."
7028500,7032740," So basically it comes down to how well you can play the part."
7032740,7037380," I think we absolutely need to set a time limit for next time or we need to set like a like"
7037380,7040100," a like a speaker's baton or whatever."
7040100,7041100," Yes."
7041100,7045820," So we can't talk over each other, but there's like a clear I state my case."
7045820,7051500," You offer your rebuttal, I get to kind of close out my argument and then the judge decides."
7051500,7052500," Yeah."
7052500,7054620," And I think it should take place over a span of like three to four minutes."
7054620,7055620," I think it's a pretty good time."
7055620,7056620," I think that's a good idea."
7056620,7062100," Ferno 182 in the float plane chat says a nine should be being so convincing you actually"
7062100,7064220," need to punch the other person on the face."
7064220,7067980," I mean, I was getting there."
7067980,7069940," Okay."
7069940,7073940," You, you, the pure patent argument was actually pretty good."
7073940,7078260," I think it was, and I think you had to because you have to follow the points that are being"
7078260,7080580," made in the like article or whatever."
7080580,7081580," Sure."
7081580,7087340," But once you, once you veered off the purely talking about patents, then it started getting"
7087340,7088340," pokeable."
7088340,7091020," But when it's just a patent, it's like, oh yeah, they do actually."
7091020,7092340," Well, yes, like that's your patent."
7092340,7094620," So like no, no, no."
7094620,7099020," And I mean, okay, I think you could probably poke holes in that anyway."
7099020,7101180," You could attack the broken patent system."
7101180,7102180," Oh, yeah."
7102180,7103180," I mean, it's atrocious."
7103180,7114300," I mean, we, we became aware of a patent that is basically just like attaching RGB LEDs to"
7114300,7117780," a particular like, like product."
7117780,7118780," You want to know something?"
7118780,7121580," I'm sitting and going, well, come on, right?"
7121580,7127100," And the legal process for it is either you just make your product, wait for them to sue"
7127100,7133900," you and then countersue or you have to like go and try and get their patent invalidated."
7133900,7137900," And it's like, okay."
7137900,7138900," Brutal."
7138900,7139900," Yeah."
7139900,7140900," Yeah."
7140900,7141900," Sorry, what you're going to say?"
7141900,7144820," So I don't know if you remember this, but really long time ago, there was a game."
7144820,7148580," I don't remember what game it was, but during loading screens."
7148580,7149580," Minor VGA."
7149580,7151380," During loading screens."
7151380,7153220," There's like a little mini game that you could play."
7153220,7154220," You know about this?"
7154220,7155220," Yes, I do."
7155220,7160260," There's a patent on mini games during loading screens, which like, isn't that important"
7160260,7161260," these days?"
7161260,7162580," Because most loading screens are pretty short now."
7162580,7163580," Right?"
7163580,7166500," But back in the day, there's some loading screens that were pretty chungus."
7166500,7172020," If you were playing like more wind on the original Xbox, it was long."
7172020,7174300," That loading screen took forever."
7174300,7178860," Loading back off of like DVDs and CDs and stuff like that used to take a really long"
7178860,7179860," time."
7179860,7180860," Painful."
7180860,7183620," So at that point in time, if you could just play like pong."
7183620,7184620," Yeah."
7184620,7187260," If you're playing a multiplayer game and there's a huge loading screen, you and your buddy"
7187260,7190820," can like fight each other in pong or like some other like who cares little game that"
7190820,7192100," will just keep you interested."
7192100,7193980," That would have been way better."
7193980,7194980," But some..."
7194980,7195980," That dynamic."
7195980,7196980," Yeah."
7196980,7197980," Yeah."
7197980,7198980," Yeah."
7198980,7199980," Why?"
7199980,7201980," They panned it and then they were just like, \"Nope, nobody can do it."
7201980,7202980," You don't have to pay us.\""
7202980,7207380," And then it's not going to be worth it to pay them for anybody because it's just a minor"
7207380,7208380," inconvenience."
7208380,7209380," So it's going to buy the game."
7209380,7214220," So basically decades of people's lives were spent just sitting."
7214220,7215220," Staring at loading bars."
7215220,7216220," Staring at loading bars."
7216220,7217220," Just why?"
7217220,7219220," What was the point?"
7219220,7220220," Ugh."
7220220,7221220," Money."
7221220,7222900," Please react to Skyblivian."
7222900,7223900," Yeah."
7223900,7224900," I don't..."
7224900,7225900," Oh."
7225900,7226900," I mean, you were talking about it before the show started."
7226900,7227900," I'm personally excited."
7227900,7228900," I'm personally excited."
7228900,7231180," Why don't you tell the people what it is?"
7231180,7236340," So Skyblivian and let me look it up just to make sure that I say it in the way that"
7236340,7237340," they say it."
7237340,7241820," Skyblivian is a volunteer based project by the Tess Renewal Modding Group."
7241820,7242820," Tess Renewal."
7242820,7243820," Sure."
7243820,7252420," Tess Renewal, as far as my understanding goes, includes Skyblivian and Skywind."
7252420,7253420," Is it Skywind?"
7253420,7254420," I think it's Skywind."
7254420,7257700," Which is the Morrowind in Skyrim Engine."
7257700,7263460," We aim to bring the Elder Scrolls IV oblivion to a new generation of gamers and reintroduce"
7263460,7265740," it to long time fans of the series."
7265740,7270240," We're currently in the process of remaking Cyrodiil along with all of its quest locations"
7270240,7273880," and characters into Skyrim and Skyrim Special Edition."
7273880,7277320," So they built oblivion into the Skyrim Engine."
7277320,7278640," That is wild."
7278640,7280040," And they..."
7280040,7284360," When they make like textures and everything else that goes into making a game visually,"
7284360,7288600," auditorially, everything else, they made really good quality ones."
7288600,7291120," So it looks better than Skyrim did when it launched."
7291120,7292120," Wow."
7292120,7294680," And Skyrim, like Vanilla Skyrim is..."
7294680,7295680," It's okay."
7295680,7296680," It's dated but it..."
7296680,7297880," Sure, it feels old."
7297880,7298880," Yeah."
7298880,7303440," It feels old like original RuneScape or Morrowind, for example."
7303440,7304440," Yeah."
7304440,7305440," It doesn't feel old like that."
7305440,7306440," Yeah."
7306440,7307440," Oblivion's kind of..."
7307440,7308440," Like I can't tell what that is."
7308440,7309440," It's not that kind of old."
7309440,7310440," Yeah."
7310440,7312240," Like is that supposed to be leather or stone?"
7312240,7313240," Yeah."
7313240,7314240," So it's..."
7314240,7315240," Skyrim was like..."
7315240,7316240," Or wood."
7316240,7317240," It's kind of okay."
7317240,7318720," It doesn't age as bad as a lot of old games, even though it's from..."
7318720,7319720," A skin tone."
7319720,7322160," Or over a decade ago."
7322160,7326080," But the models and stuff that they've made..."
7326080,7328440," Let's talk about fair use for a second."
7328440,7331600," I can show part of the trailer here."
7331600,7332600," Can I?"
7332600,7333600," I mean, this player like..."
7333600,7334600," You can try."
7334600,7336160," Let me bring it up on YouTube."
7336160,7337800," It's going to show an ad."
7337800,7340240," Oh my goodness."
7340240,7341240," Okay."
7341240,7342240," Skip."
7342240,7344360," There we go."
7344360,7345360," Let's jump into it."
7345360,7346360," Like it looks..."
7346360,7347440," That looks really good."
7347440,7348760," Really good."
7348760,7350080," It looks great."
7350080,7351440," This is in the Skyrim engine."
7351440,7354120," So the controls are going to be pretty good."
7354120,7357320," It supports these high resolution textures."
7357320,7358320," Wow."
7358320,7360160," The engine does..."
7360160,7362600," The Marble Chas was moving."
7362600,7364160," I'm super excited about this."
7364160,7367880," The announcement is like 2025 or something."
7367880,7368880," Right."
7368880,7373400," But they've been working on this for a really long time."
7373400,7376720," So the fact that it has a date at all is fantastic."
7376720,7381280," And what I've heard from at least one member of the team is that they think that the date"
7381280,7383720," is very safe."
7383720,7387480," They think they're going to be done ahead of the date that they placed."
7387480,7390640," But they put it there because they're like, \"We can definitely make this.\""
7390640,7392040," And that's the right way to approach it."
7392040,7396840," Does that hurt some armor though?"
7396840,7398600," There's some armor sitting on top of the horse."
7398600,7405720," And you can see like, no, it doesn't look like a release today, new AAA absolute title."
7405720,7406720," But that's not the point."
7406720,7407720," It's not the point."
7407720,7412320," It looks amazing for the fact that it's oblivion."
7412320,7416240," It looks amazing even for like really high quality Skyrim mods."
7416240,7421040," Because this is a really high quality Skyrim mod, which is just the entirety of oblivion."
7421040,7422040," And the thing is like..."
7422040,7423040," I'm super, super excited about this."
7423040,7426480," The bar isn't as high for an older game."
7426480,7429800," You're just trying to make it digestible for a modern gamer."
7429800,7432480," Like I tried to play Morrowind when you talked about how much you loved it."
7432480,7433720," And this is even like 10 years ago."
7433720,7434720," I just couldn't."
7434720,7435720," It's brutal."
7435720,7436960," I couldn't get into it."
7436960,7441480," And like for my kids, for example, you know, like I might love Final Fantasy 6, but between"
7441480,7446480," the janky translation and lack of creature comforts like auto save and stuff like like"
7446480,7447960," it's just it's hard for them to get into it."
7447960,7451080," Whereas like I'm sitting here going, oh yeah, Pixel remaster."
7451080,7455000," Even if it's just to kind of share something that I love with my kids, it's probably worth"
7455000,7457680," the 25 bucks or whatever it is."
7457680,7464280," Versus just like, you know, blowing out a cart and sticking it into a SNASS and you"
7464280,7468120," know, it's just yeah, just not worth it."
7468120,7472440," Apparently someone in a full plane chat said they did add horse armor."
7472440,7474800," She's genuinely hilarious."
7474800,7477640," But yeah, Skywind is the other one."
7477640,7482000," I'm obviously like more excited about Skywind because Morrowind is my favorite game, but"
7482000,7485760," oblivion is a I loved oblivion as well."
7485760,7488200," It's the one Elder Scrolls game I've actually played."
7488200,7489200," Yeah."
7489200,7491080," Like all the way through tons of side quests."
7491080,7492960," Like I played the crap out of oblivion."
7492960,7494200," It's a really good game."
7494200,7501320," I wasn't I didn't have a good computer for Morrowind and then I had a lot on my plate"
7501320,7502320," for Skywind."
7502320,7504120," That makes sense."
7504120,7505120," Yeah."
7505120,7512400," Oblivion was a massive step in like visual fidelity and game mechanics that were approachable"
7512400,7514400," for people."
7514400,7518720," A lot of what I don't like about the step from Morrowind to oblivion is like Morrowind"
7518720,7522600," had more different weapon categories and deeper systems in certain ways and like all"
7522600,7523600," the way through the game."
7523600,7524600," But you play Tarkov."
7524600,7525600," Yeah."
7525600,7526600," Yeah."
7526600,7528440," It's like, oh, I'm sorry."
7528440,7534480," You want to put that bullet in that gun and that weather at that time of day."
7534480,7538160," Well, three, six, six ammo fits in a seven, six, two mag, but it doesn't fit into a seven,"
7538160,7539720," six, two rifle."
7539720,7540720," Anywho."
7540720,7541720," Yeah."
7541720,7546320," So like I understand, but yeah, I'm really, really excited about this."
7546320,7549960," I'm absolutely going to play it the day it launches."
7549960,7550960," Really cool project."
7550960,7553400," You believe they're looking for volunteers."
7553400,7559040," So if you're into whatever they're looking for, probably development, but I know they"
7559040,7561240," often look, it might be done now."
7561240,7565440," I don't know, but they often look like voice actors and whatever else because they're redoing"
7565440,7568320," like a lot of the voice lines and stuff."
7568320,7571920," And as far as I know, they're adding more than what the base game had."
7571920,7573120," That's pretty cool."
7573120,7574120," So I don't know."
7574120,7577040," Hopefully I didn't see anything wrong there, but very exciting."
7577040,7578600," Why don't we do a couple of merch messages?"
7578600,7582080," For those of you wondering, the way to have your message come across the bottom of the"
7582080,7584320," screen here, maybe get an answer from Dan."
7584320,7589320," Maybe we'll talk about it on the show is you head over to LTTStore.com and we've got"
7589320,7592320," a new product announcement this week."
7592320,7593320," Yeah."
7593320,7596400," Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, there's"
7596400,7597400," more."
7597400,7598400," Wait, what the crap?"
7598400,7600560," Where's the, where's the link to this?"
7600560,7601720," Ah, yes."
7601720,7603400," Here it is."
7603400,7606840," We have a new color of underwear."
7606840,7613480," How with this cool, like, circuit design in yellow, black, and purple slash, white, and"
7613480,7614960," blue."
7614960,7617720," Here's all the different styles that we have."
7617720,7622560," Thank you to our wonderful underwear models who helped us model all the new stuff."
7622560,7623760," Is he dancing with a skeleton?"
7623760,7624760," I love it."
7624760,7625760," Thanks, Tynan."
7625760,7627160," That's truly wonderful."
7627160,7631360," I'm having a lively conversation with my mannequin."
7631360,7633520," Note our matching underwear, by the way."
7633520,7636440," Anywho, we've got lots of stock of these."
7636440,7642640," They just came in and, I mean, the reviews are, the reviews are in on the LTT underwear."
7642640,7646720," It's four and a half, I think, four and a half stars or whatever it works out to with"
7646720,7648280," over 400 reviews."
7648280,7651880," This has been one of our most successful long-term products."
7651880,7653120," Guys check them out."
7653120,7660560," Anyway, the reason that I'm mentioning this is because lots of people throw money at, like,"
7660560,7665280," well, people who are quite wealthy on the internet and get basically nothing in return"
7665280,7671800," other than maybe being noticed by Senpai, which I've always found kind of ridiculous."
7671800,7673640," So we created a better system."
7673640,7678760," You can send a merch message and that way Senpai might notice you, Senpai might not,"
7678760,7682140," but either way you will get some quality merchandise in the mail."
7682140,7686520," Just check out the merch messages box in the cart and your merch message will go through"
7686520,7691960," to producer Dan, who will funnel it into the appropriate place where it might go."
7691960,7693760," Dan, do you want to feed us a couple of merch messages?"
7693760,7695480," Sure, I've got one here from James."
7695480,7697160," Question for Luke and Linus."
7697160,7699480," Either one of you ever play RuneScape back in the day."
7699480,7701720," Seems like a lot of people have forgotten about it."
7701720,7703520," I never tried it."
7703520,7706360," I definitely did play."
7706360,7710120," I was very into games like that."
7710120,7711760," What are the other games like that?"
7711760,7714120," Well, back then it was, I mean, not back then."
7714120,7715120," It's an MMO."
7715120,7716120," Okay."
7716120,7718360," RuneScape, different format."
7718360,7722160," It was in your browser, all this kind of stuff, but it was still an MMO."
7722160,7727880," I was a little smaller child when RuneScape was first coming around."
7727880,7732040," I have two stories that I think are funny from back in the RuneScape days."
7732040,7738480," We had Netnanny and DialUp, also known as the Internet, is probably slower than most"
7738480,7743720," people watching this could actually understand to the point where I tell this story and people"
7743720,7745320," think I'm exaggerating."
7745320,7746320," I'm not."
7746320,7749960," I used to load up RuneScape, and then I think I've told you this before."
7749960,7755080," I used to load up RuneScape and then go downstairs, make a sandwich, make some juice, eat the"
7755080,7760200," sandwich, drink the juice, go back upstairs, and it was usually almost unloading."
7760200,7765440," I am not exaggerating, and I eat really slowly."
7765440,7767560," This is something that I could do consistently."
7767560,7771960," It was impressive to me, even when I was a kid, that it would complete loading."
7771960,7772960," Yeah."
7772960,7774840," But it would."
7774840,7779240," Then I could actually play the game, which was great."
7779240,7781880," The other one is that it's an MMO."
7781880,7784400," People talk to each other."
7784400,7787440," In that game, speech bubbles."
7787440,7788440," Sure."
7788440,7791880," I would walk by and I would see someone with a speech bubble over their head, and I would"
7791880,7794040," automatically think they were talking to me."
7794040,7797200," I used to just run up to anyone that was talking and just respond to anything that they were"
7797200,7798680," saying."
7798680,7799680," [laughter]"
7799680,7803920," One of my friends watched me play once and then was like, \"What are you doing?\""
7803920,7805160," I was like, \"What do you mean?\""
7805160,7807760," They're like, \"They're not talking to you."
7807760,7810440," They're talking to the person that's standing in front of them or whatever.\""
7810440,7811800," I'm like, \"Oh.\""
7811800,7812800," [laughter]"
7812800,7813800," Okay."
7813800,7816800," [laughter]"
7816800,7821360," I mean, we've all had our idiotic gaming moments."
7821360,7823880," I have some far more recent ones than that."
7823880,7824880," Oh?"
7824880,7833640," Yeah, there was this VR game that was like a three-dimensional arena space shooter thing."
7833640,7835640," Sure."
7835640,7843880," The only way that I could best describe it is there's this showdown scene where the dark"
7843880,7851000," Jedi student fights one of the good ones in the young Jedi Knight series of expanded universe"
7851000,7856240," novels where it's basically this dome cage match zero gravity thing."
7856240,7863840," Anyway, it was kind of like that, which is going to be a pretty obscure way of describing"
7863840,7864840," it."
7864840,7865840," It's like perfectly, though."
7865840,7866840," Yeah."
7866840,7867840," But for most..."
7867840,7870520," The scene with Zek and he has to fight like Jaina or whatever it is."
7870520,7872040," I don't remember anyway."
7872040,7876160," The point is like a lot better than the sequel trilogy."
7876160,7883200," Anyway, it was basically that and I didn't realize as I was like sitting there like just"
7883200,7888240," talking to myself about like my frustrations and like chatting with people that the mic"
7888240,7892920," in this game is just like automatically open and I've got these like 11-year-olds screeching"
7892920,7893920," in my ear."
7893920,7895240," I can't figure out how to turn it off."
7895240,7896920," I'm seeing they're going, \"How do I turn this off?"
7896920,7899480," How do I turn this off?\""
7899480,7902760," It was definitely an old man moment for me."
7902760,7903760," That's pretty funny."
7903760,7904760," Yeah."
7904760,7905760," All right."
7905760,7906760," Dan, hit me."
7906760,7907760," Okay."
7907760,7908760," This one's from Nathan."
7908760,7912440," Thoughts on account locked phones becoming largely e-waste."
7912440,7916760," Fell into the trap of unknowingly buying a locked phone on eBay and Apple would not take"
7916760,7918560," the phone or assist in any way."
7918560,7922000," They can be used for parts but it would be nice if they were reusable."
7922000,7923000," I can't lock phones."
7923000,7924000," What do you mean?"
7924000,7926720," Yeah, iCloud locked phones, that sort of thing."
7926720,7927720," They're basically..."
7927720,7928720," I'm going to use Apple."
7928720,7933760," Yeah, they're basically Internet factory hardware locked and you can't get past them"
7933760,7935760," very easily at all."
7935760,7938120," Honestly, I fully support it."
7938120,7939120," I know."
7939120,7945280," Controversial take but password like hardware encrypted devices."
7945280,7946280," Wouldn't this..."
7946280,7948200," With the NAND?"
7948200,7949200," With like the storage?"
7949200,7954640," Whether through the NAND or through the controller with the storage essentially permanently bound"
7954640,7958640," to the board, basically eliminated phone theft."
7958640,7961560," I was just going to say, wouldn't this dissuade phone theft?"
7961560,7962560," Yeah."
7962560,7966480," And to be clear, phone theft is not eliminated and there are workarounds."
7966480,7968000," You can desolder..."
7968000,7970400," But it significantly..."
7970400,7972400," Could you?"
7972400,7973800," ...do you incentivized phone theft."
7973800,7978480," And phone theft was a huge problem in the early to mid-nots."
7978480,7984560," If you were able to get into the phone, could you release your account from it?"
7984560,7985560," Yeah."
7985560,7987160," Yeah, then I don't think that's a problem."
7987160,7994680," Yeah, but well, it is a problem because we run into careless users donating phones and"
7994680,8002400," not unlocking them or even careless organizations basically saying, \"Yeah, these are all managed"
8002400,8003520," by our organization."
8003520,8008520," We wish for these to be destroyed because we have whatever irrational concerns about"
8008520,8013520," data theft or whatever from our school or whatever stupid thing like what..."
8013520,8014520," What's..."
8014520,8016400," Okay, I shouldn't say that."
8016400,8020040," There are valid reasons why a school might blah blah student grades, et cetera, et cetera."
8020040,8022360," But the point is they can be wiped."
8022360,8023360," It's fine."
8023360,8024360," Chill."
8024360,8030160," So where they basically dictate, no, these iPads need to be destroyed because someone"
8030160,8033440," might find out our typing tutor scores or whatever."
8033440,8034440," Take away."
8034440,8040320," I don't think they should take that feature away just because there's like negligent use."
8040320,8045440," No, but we do need a solution though, right?"
8045440,8051000," And the only really viable solution is a backdoor."
8051000,8053560," And a backdoor is automatically..."
8053560,8055000," A backdoor is a door."
8055000,8056800," If you have the key, someone else has the key."
8056800,8057800," Exactly."
8057800,8060800," So yeah, it's one of those really tough ones, right?"
8060800,8063200," I've said before on this show."
8063200,8068400," Someone who claims that the solution is simple to a problem that has not been solved yet"
8068400,8072640," is either a liar or an idiot, right?"
8072640,8078000," All I'm saying here is that I think the solution is worth it."
8078000,8080200," Like I think phones should be hard-locked."
8080200,8081200," Yeah."
8081200,8082200," Oh, no, no."
8082200,8083800," I meant the solution to the Seawaste problem."
8083800,8084800," Oh, yeah."
8084800,8085800," Yeah."
8085800,8086800," And I just..."
8086800,8087800," Yeah, no."
8087800,8092120," I fully support working device encryption."
8092120,8099520," Whether it's phones or laptops, computers, portable ones, not portable ones, are no longer"
8099520,8102200," such a huge target for theft."
8102200,8105280," And it's..."
8105280,8108160," It's my..."
8108160,8113800," My take, whether I can defend it or not, is I think it's better this way."
8113800,8114800," Yeah, me too."
8114800,8115800," Yeah, me too."
8115800,8116800," And you know what?"
8116800,8117800," Me too."
8117800,8119680," That's one thing that I do agree with."
8119680,8123600," But let me into the bootloader when I own the phone."
8123600,8124600," Yeah."
8124600,8125600," You want another one?"
8125600,8126600," You're going to move on."
8126600,8127600," You won't get any argument from us there."
8127600,8128600," No."
8128600,8129600," You know what?"
8129600,8131760," I want to do a not-merged message one real quick here."
8131760,8134240," This is from Dark24 over in the floatplane chat."
8134240,8136280," I don't like merch messages."
8136280,8139040," To me, it's too convoluted to try and get a message to WAN show."
8139040,8141440," It needs to be as easy as it is on YouTube."
8141440,8145080," Plus, I get you think it's better for the user, but users don't necessarily care that"
8145080,8149880," YouTube gets a split where our LTT does not want YouTube to get that cut."
8149880,8151240," So it's a couple of things."
8151240,8153000," Number one is, yeah, it's more convoluted."
8153000,8156680," We had to build the tool ourselves because merch messages wasn't working properly, still"
8156680,8157680," isn't working properly."
8157680,8158680," No, stop."
8158680,8159680," Or merch."
8159680,8162680," Super chats wasn't working properly."
8162680,8164680," Back to my screen sharing."
8164680,8167320," Still isn't working properly."
8167320,8168320," Literally none."
8168320,8169320," The entire show."
8169320,8170320," I doubt it."
8170320,8171320," Oh my god."
8171320,8172320," Stop."
8172320,8175000," Usually when I show you guys this, there's like one here because people don't get the"
8175000,8177920," message and they send it through here and I'm like, okay, I mean, if you really want"
8177920,8179440," to, by all means, I'm not going to turn it off."
8179440,8186200," Like if you just want to throw money at the screen, that's your right, I guess."
8186200,8187640," So yeah, it's convoluted."
8187640,8188960," We had to build it."
8188960,8196840," But it's also not about being a part of it is, yeah, I don't think YouTube should get"
8196840,8199480," a split for building features that don't work properly."
8199480,8202000," No, no, I actually don't think they do."
8202000,8204160," We can disagree on that."
8204160,8209440," We've had a lot of cases where you need to refresh the page or something."
8209440,8211160," Whatever happens, you lose that tab."
8211160,8212160," And they go away."
8212160,8215280," Now, historically, all of them are gone and that's a huge friction point."
8215280,8216760," That's a bad user experience."
8216760,8220360," I don't really think that's debatable."
8220360,8224120," And then as for, as for, I get you think it is better for the user."
8224120,8230240," Again, I don't really, I don't really think that's debatable."
8230240,8237040," It is everything that, you know, whatever bits or whatever other thing is, it is a way"
8237040,8238760," of interacting with the show."
8238760,8242880," You know, you can have a little thing come up or whatever."
8242880,8247600," And if you don't want the thing in the mail, you can just buy a gift card."
8247600,8251360," Like if you just want to throw money at the screen, then like, I guess you can do that."
8251360,8253200," We have gift cards."
8253200,8258360," And I mean, I'm about to, I'm about to have a super hot take here."
8258360,8265280," I had someone criticize us for the lowest, the lowest barrier of entry for merge messages"
8265280,8267200," being the $10 gift card."
8267200,8270680," Because that's the lowest value of gift card on LTT store."
8270680,8272200," And I had typed up the thing."
8272200,8277320," I decided not to send it, but I guess I'm going to say it now live on the show is that $10"
8277320,8279000," threshold shouldn't be a problem."
8279000,8282520," If you don't have $10 of disposable income, you should not be throwing it at me."
8282520,8283760," Don't do a merge message."
8283760,8284760," Yeah."
8284760,8286680," Plain and simple."
8286680,8290920," If you happen to need something and we have a high quality version of that thing, you happen"
8290920,8293440," to need by all means sending a merge message."
8293440,8298160," But if $10 is if money is that tight for you that that you need it to be $5 instead"
8298160,8300040," of $10, we don't want to."
8300040,8302840," I don't want it."
8302840,8304840," Yep."
8304840,8305840," All right."
8305840,8306840," All right."
8306840,8311200," Dan, hit me with one more and then we'll do a couple more topics and then we'll go into"
8311200,8313920," more of the like, merge message Q&A towards the end of the show."
8313920,8318680," Oh, yeah, sure."
8318680,8324320," What is your process of selecting a supplier for a new or existing LTT store.com merch?"
8324320,8325800," Oh, yeah, sure."
8325800,8330640," I mean, well, one of the, there's a lot of different ways you can kind of tackle it."
8330640,8335320," So with the backpack, for example, we are not working."
8335320,8341680," We are, okay, we are, we can communicate directly with the actual manufacturer, but we are working"
8341680,8347360," through a firm that facilitates these kinds of products."
8347360,8351960," So they have their own kind of like factory network and they helped us out a lot with"
8351960,8354680," the durability material selection."
8354680,8363480," Like we were not, I don't know, whatever the way of using the word hubris is to describe"
8363480,8370000," this, we're, we're not egotistical enough to think that somehow we can just walk into"
8370000,8375960," a completely new product category and imagine that we're somehow going to absolutely nail"
8375960,8378320," it on the first try without some help."
8378320,8383320," So we, we worked through a third party firm."
8383320,8387200," So in that case, it was, you know, we found someone who had the relationships and had the"
8387200,8390160," capabilities to help us bring it to market."
8390160,8397200," In the case of the screwdriver, for example, it was pretty similar, but then ended up being"
8397200,8404080," different because of the way that the relationship between our partner and their factory broke"
8404080,8407680," down during the process, which we outlined in more detail in the video on the making"
8407680,8409640," of the screwdriver."
8409640,8414840," In the case of something like water bottles, you know, we were, we kind of reached out"
8414840,8421240," to pretty much every water bottle manufacturer we could find until we laid out our specs."
8421240,8424280," So it's kind of like an ODM job."
8424280,8426760," So do you know the difference between OEM and ODM?"
8426760,8428720," No, I've actually never heard of ODM."
8428720,8429720," Oh, okay."
8429720,8437720," So OEM, or original equipment manufacturer is basically where a factory builds a product"
8437720,8442600," for someone else to slap their label on and sell."
8442600,8445000," That is an OEM product."
8445000,8452000," An ODM product is where you go to the manufacturer who makes said products and you go, okay,"
8452000,8457400," what you have is pretty okay, but here are my specs and we need you to build it to this"
8457400,8458400," standard."
8458400,8459400," Okay."
8459400,8466240," So the vast, vast majority of what is on LTTstore.com would be ODM work from the manufacturers."
8466240,8468920," So with our base product, you wanted some changes to it."
8468920,8471400," Yeah, so like plushies, for example, they make plushies."
8471400,8475600," They don't make a Linus-shaped one."
8475600,8476600," That makes sense."
8476600,8477600," Obviously, right?"
8477600,8478600," Why would they?"
8478600,8479600," Yeah, like you're not."
8479600,8480600," Yeah."
8480600,8481600," Yeah, that makes sense."
8481600,8484800," So you didn't just rebadge a product."
8484800,8485800," No."
8485800,8489200," But you also didn't make a new manufacturing facility for a product."
8489200,8490200," No."
8490200,8493000," You worked with a manufacturing facility to make similar things and just got them to adapt"
8493000,8494000," it to what you wanted."
8494000,8495000," Yeah."
8495000,8498840," And a lot of the times, you know, it's not everything comes from under one roof, right?"
8498840,8502640," Like even something as simple as a pair of underwear, right?"
8502640,8507000," There's, they're going to have to bring in elastics from somewhere else."
8507000,8514800," Having this plastic free packaging involved finding a source for plastic free packaging"
8514800,8517320," that will also keep it safe and shipping, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera."
8517320,8522400," Like we're trying to move completely away from plastic in our packaging."
8522400,8528680," So what I'm trying to say is that when everything you're building is custom, you know, even"
8528680,8536680," down to the, even down to the composition of this, the, the, I don't want to get it"
8536680,8538320," wrong."
8538320,8540880," And our first generation labels are really bad."
8540880,8542720," That's something we're improving."
8542720,8543720," So I actually can't read it."
8543720,8544720," So you know what?"
8544720,8545720," It doesn't matter."
8545720,8552640," The point is the fiber blend of like our custom shirts was a painstaking process."
8552640,8555640," That's why it takes us so long."
8555640,8556800," All right."
8556800,8559480," Why don't we do a couple more topics here?"
8559480,8560480," All right."
8560480,8563240," Oh, there's an LTX 2023 update."
8563240,8564800," We have an FAQ now."
8564800,8568800," We have safety policies."
8568800,8571800," Do we have, do we have a contact info?"
8571800,8577400," We don't yet have a date that we're going to be reaching out to LTX 2020 VIP ticket holders,"
8577400,8581680," but they are saying very soon."
8581680,8588480," Ask us questions via the form on the FAQ page or by emailing info@ltxxpo.com."
8588480,8589480," There you go."
8589480,8590480," All right."
8590480,8592960," So we have, we have support now, which is pretty cool."
8592960,8593960," We don't."
8593960,8596120," Everyone message support your question at once."
8596120,8599680," Maybe assume someone else will do it and it'll be added to the FAQ sometime in the next"
8599680,8600880," week or two."
8600880,8605600," We do not have a team of eight people working on support for LTX at this time, given that"
8605600,8609240," the Expo is still like almost six months out."
8609240,8612280," We do have Expo sponsors and partners that we can share publicly."
8612280,8613280," Oh, cool."
8613280,8622720," Courser, the gaming stadium, Kanto, Memory Express, MSI, NZXT, CSONIC, and SecretLab."
8622720,8625560," Those guys."
8625560,8627560," Cool."
8627560,8633440," If there are partners who want to exhibit or work with us, reach out to partner@ltxxpo.com."
8633440,8635960," Heck yeah."
8635960,8638560," All right."
8638560,8644600," Oh, I need to talk about the new angel investment disclosure."
8644600,8649720," So I had talked recently about how there was a NAS product that I was really excited"
8649720,8651480," about the future of."
8651480,8653760," I have a couple more things to share."
8653760,8660000," So first of all, is that based on you guys being overwhelmingly supportive of it, I really"
8660000,8666000," don't think that I've allowed the float plane sponsorship to affect our content in any meaningful"
8666000,8667000," way."
8667000,8669480," I obviously daily drive a float plane laptop."
8669480,8674920," I obviously want them to succeed, but okay."
8674920,8675920," I mean, hit me."
8675920,8677920," I just didn't know we were making laptops."
8677920,8678920," We are."
8678920,8682840," Oh, I video players, video website is hard enough."
8682840,8684160," No, no, no, no."
8684160,8685800," I'm not making laptops."
8685800,8687760," I invested in float up."
8687760,8691240," Oh, it's a big endeavor."
8691240,8693880," If you want me to do it, man, I'll figure it out."
8693880,8697480," I'm just saying it's hard and we already do a lot of hard stuff."
8697480,8698480," Framework."
8698480,8700600," Apparently, I can't even remember what company I'm invested in."
8700600,8701600," So I got money."
8701600,8702680," I'm invested in that one too."
8702680,8704840," So it's all kind of the same to me."
8704840,8705840," Yeah."
8705840,8706840," Yeah."
8706840,8707840," Anywho."
8707840,8713960," Yeah, I don't, I sincerely do not believe I have allowed it to affect my laptop coverage."
8713960,8718640," Frankly, most days, I don't think of it at all."
8718640,8724440," Even when I am sitting down, like evaluating a laptop, I don't necessarily remember unless"
8724440,8728760," I look at the laptop and go, wow, that seems like really anti-consumer or really anti-write"
8728760,8729760," to repair."
8729760,8733360," I wish it was more like framework who I'm invested in."
8733360,8734760," Like that."
8734760,8736840," It's kind of an afterthought for me."
8736840,8741960," But this one, I think, is even more cut and dried just because it's a category of product"
8741960,8745800," that we don't really cover to the same degree."
8745800,8748040," So it's NAS software."
8748040,8755440," And the bottom line is that enterprise NAS solutions, yeah, they have their place, but"
8755440,8759680," current operating systems tend to assume that the person managing and configuring the server"
8759680,8760920," is an IT expert."
8760920,8768320," And not like enthusiast who's into it, but someone who actually has some training or"
8768320,8775360," has done extensive research, they can be frustrating and inaccessible to small creators, consumers,"
8775360,8777200," prosumers, and enthusiasts."
8777200,8782760," So the goal with this project is to design an intuitive and accessible home server solution"
8782760,8784640," for all users."
8784640,8788080," The new company has, they describe themselves as an impressive team."
8788080,8789340," I love you guys."
8789340,8791480," They have a team, for sure."
8791480,8793720," I look forward to being impressed."
8793720,8795960," You call your team world class."
8795960,8797360," My team is world class."
8797360,8800360," Sometimes they even get the P in the toilet without getting it on the seat."
8800360,8802760," I consider that to be quite world class."
8802760,8805680," A bit of an inside joke."
8805680,8807680," Anywho, you know what, fine."
8807680,8808680," I'll bite."
8808680,8812660," The new company has an impressive team headed by two longtime tech veterans who recently"
8812660,8817160," completed an eight-year stint at Unraid, where they were responsible for modernization"
8817160,8822180," in the form of implementing Docker and virtual machines, GPU pass-through, and rebranding"
8822180,8823540," and marketing respectively."
8823540,8829260," We're not going to get too far into the weeds for now, but I am officially their angel investor"
8829260,8832700," and you can expect some updates in the future."
8832700,8834460," I'm actually excited for this."
8834460,8836700," Yeah, I'm really excited."
8836700,8838700," Have you ever met those guys?"
8838700,8839700," No."
8839700,8840700," Oh, okay."
8840700,8841700," Cool."
8841700,8842700," Okay."
8842700,8843700," Well, okay."
8843700,8844700," The video call."
8844700,8845700," Okay."
8845700,8846700," Yeah."
8846700,8853260," They're cool enough that I don't even have a proper legal document for my shares, and"
8853260,8855220," they already have the check."
8855220,8858420," So either I just got ripped super hard."
8858420,8859700," That'd be pretty epic."
8859700,8867540," Or these guys are super chill, and I'm right about that, and this is going to be awesome."
8867540,8871420," There really is no middle ground here, I think."
8871420,8874060," Oh, no."
8874060,8875060," Yeah."
8875060,8876060," Cool."
8876060,8878380," What else we got to talk about today?"
8878380,8880780," Oh, oh, oh, thank goodness."
8880780,8884140," There's a new home pod."
8884140,8887380," Now with temperature and humidity sensors for smart home."
8887380,8888900," I thought they were done with these."
8888900,8892540," I thought so too, but no, it's a second gen home pod."
8892540,8897540," It's $50 less than the first gen starting price at $300 US dollars."
8897540,8903620," Has fewer tweeters and fewer mics, which is cool, but it adds UWB and thread."
8903620,8910660," So it has that location chip, which could be actually really neat."
8910660,8914700," If you had a home pod all over your house because you're a mega baller, and then you"
8914700,8920300," have your iPhone, it could know where you are and play music your farther away."
8920300,8921740," It could make it louder or something."
8921740,8926300," I don't know if they'll ever implement anything like that, but theoretically they could."
8926300,8932180," The home pod mini also secretly included the humidity and temperature sensors, so it will"
8932180,8933660," be updated to activate them."
8933660,8934660," So that's cool."
8934660,8937300," Adding features to a smart home product instead of removing them."
8937300,8939100," I mean, I guess I support this."
8939100,8945900," I'm not that into hidden sensors and things that are not disclosed."
8945900,8952660," I mean, you know, I'm dancestly."
8952660,8955020," He's gone."
8955020,8956460," He walked right off the set."
8956460,8959300," If he's anything like me, he probably has to go peepee at this point because we've been"
8959300,8960700," on the show for quite a while."
8960700,8962180," It has been a long time."
8962180,8966860," Anyway, there's some also other more different new Apple products."
8966860,8971780," There's M2 Pro and Max and they're faster, and there's like some MacBooks and some Mac"
8971780,8972940," minis that have those in them."
8972940,8973940," I guess that's pretty cool."
8973940,8975740," This is a pretty quiet announcement."
8975740,8978060," I think we got our hands on a couple of them."
8978060,8982620," I don't even know if we're going to cover these things on LTT though."
8982620,8987340," We tend to be so late on them that by the time we cover them, the conversation's sort"
8987340,8988340," of over."
8988340,8990060," So we'll probably just hit them on short circuit."
8990060,8993740," Yeah, sorry, it's lower quality content, but you guys don't want the in-depth stuff apparently"
8993740,8996500," because you don't watch it, so I guess whatever."
8996500,9000260," And then we'll definitely cover them on Mac address eventually."
9000260,9002860," They'll get around to it."
9002860,9006620," And then in the future, once the lab is all set up, we'll be able to really pump this"
9006620,9010260," stuff out, but in the meantime, I just don't think it's feasible and LTT we've got too"
9010260,9011780," much else going on."
9011780,9020020," In other Apple news, Apple TV requires a separate Apple device to accept the terms of service."
9020020,9027780," This week, Twitter user @HugeLgUp posted a picture of their Apple TV which was inoperable"
9027780,9032900," because it required the user to accept the terms and conditions agreement on a separate"
9032900,9037740," device using an up-to-date copy of iOS."
9037740,9046060," I have talked extensively about this kind of error from Apple."
9046060,9047820," Oh, I'm sorry."
9047820,9050700," You haven't purchased enough of our products."
9050700,9054860," Well, I hope you don't expect the ones you did buy to function."
9054860,9057700," Ha ha, maybe next time you should be more rich."
9057700,9064420," I was actually hoping this was going to come up from the wheel because I was really interested"
9064420,9069020," in how this was going to go so I had to try to defend it."
9069020,9070820," Every time it was spanned by either of us."
9070820,9074100," I was just going to go straight after poor people."
9074100,9075100," That was my plan."
9075100,9079220," I was going to be like, well, they should get more money then."
9079220,9080220," That's a 10."
9080220,9081220," That's a 10."
9081220,9082220," That's a 10."
9082220,9083220," And boom."
9083220,9084220," Now we know."
9084220,9085220," Oh, man."
9085220,9092420," I mean, I've talked about this whole much in the past as a daily driver user of one"
9092420,9098820," to exactly one Apple product, the AirPods Pro 2s, or they called Pro 2."
9098820,9099820," I don't remember."
9099820,9100820," Whatever."
9100820,9103580," The second gen AirPods Pro, I can't keep track of their naming crap."
9103580,9106340," I am also a user of one and exactly one Apple product."
9106340,9109500," And it is the first gen just straight up AirPods."
9109500,9115540," So as a user of one Apple product, I have found myself extremely frustrated at the way"
9115540,9116820," that I am treated."
9116820,9119100," I am treated as a second class citizen."
9119100,9120340," There is no."
9120340,9125700," There is literally no way for me to update the firmware of my product."
9125700,9130140," In the case of the first gen AirPods, that was apparently a bit of a bullet dodge given"
9130140,9132660," that they nerfed the active noise cancellation."
9132660,9135900," But in the case of the second gen AirPods, I haven't seen any reason to believe that"
9135900,9137460," that would be a benefit."
9137460,9141980," And the fact that there is no way to plug that device because they don't explicitly"
9141980,9146100," say that it is not supported on Android or Windows devices."
9146100,9148740," And it does in fact work just fine."
9148740,9149740," Okay."
9149740,9156460," So then would you consider not providing firmware updates to be supported?"
9156460,9157980," I don't know."
9157980,9158980," I don't know."
9158980,9160820," Seems pretty BS to me."
9160820,9168340," And so the only way to update your firmware is to be paired to an iPhone, to have it nearby"
9168340,9171780," and to have them both be charging and sleeping essentially."
9171780,9174700," And then it will just happen automatically."
9174700,9175980," That's not an acceptable answer."
9175980,9178100," And I mean, Apple knew that once upon a time."
9178100,9183060," Back in the days of the iPod, they built iTunes for Windows because they understood"
9183060,9188220," when you bought an iPod, you expect an iPod."
9188220,9190220," Yep."
9190220,9196300," Someone in Flowplane chat said that they're an Apple employee and that this is a bug,"
9196300,9199100," but I don't believe them."
9199100,9201460," I believe them."
9201460,9204660," I just don't believe that it's a high priority bug."
9204660,9208860," I think that if there's no public confirmation, it's not a high priority bug."
9208860,9210260," Yeah, I don't know man."
9210260,9212700," I think that this is one of those."
9212700,9216740," This is also one of those bugs that comes about from tunnel vision."
9216740,9220780," Like this, this, this is a bug that exists because that's not a bug."
9220780,9224700," There'll be a lack of a feature because the no, no, I mean, the product is developed in"
9224700,9227420," an environment where there's an assumption."
9227420,9233900," There's it's kind of like, okay, I had a really awkward encounter in a bathroom once."
9233900,9234900," Oh my."
9234900,9235900," Okay."
9235900,9236900," Wow."
9236900,9237900," I."
9237900,9238900," I."
9238900,9247980," I, I, this, this man was at the sink to wash his hands in the bathroom and he got all"
9247980,9253740," soaked up and put his hands under the sink and like it didn't come on."
9253740,9257500," And he was like trying to figure out if there was like a manual button somewhere."
9257500,9260380," He's like getting right up to it."
9260380,9266740," And he goes, you kind of turns me goes, bro, it must be broken or something along those"
9266740,9267740," lines."
9267740,9270980," And he kind of like is on his way walking out and I go, oh man, I went, I don't know."
9270980,9272980," I put my hands under the sink."
9272980,9274620," It immediately works."
9274620,9275620," Why?"
9275620,9280020," It's skin color."
9280020,9281020," Yeah."
9281020,9282020," Yikes."
9282020,9283020," God, he was black."
9283020,9284020," Yeah."
9284020,9285980," And I'm looking at it going."
9285980,9286980," That's brutal."
9286980,9287980," That's a bug."
9287980,9288980," Oh yeah."
9288980,9291780," But fucking bad bug."
9291780,9292780," Yep."
9292780,9300380," That's not like, oops, that's like we literally only ever considered that white skin might"
9300380,9302020," go under this sensor."
9302020,9303420," That's brutal."
9303420,9304420," Big yikes."
9304420,9305420," Right."
9305420,9311180," And honestly, I see a lot of this in Apple's product development is they just have these"
9311180,9316140," complete and utter to the point where it has to be intentional blind spots."
9316140,9317140," Yeah."
9317140,9321220," But doesn't everyone have an iPhone?"
9321220,9327020," So this screen would have come up and remember, this is a big company, right?"
9327020,9333180," It's not like one person worked on the updater or like the terms and conditions update flow"
9333180,9334660," for this, right?"
9334660,9340940," So this would have come up for many people at some point and they all would have gone,"
9340940,9343500," oh, okay, so I can use my iPhone for this."
9343500,9348980," And no one at any point thought, what if I don't have an iPhone?"
9348980,9349980," That's what happened."
9349980,9350980," So yeah, it's a bug."
9350980,9353540," Yeah, it's probably an accident."
9353540,9354980," But you still suck."
9354980,9355980," Yeah."
9355980,9358660," Like that doesn't make it better."
9358660,9364820," Obviously, this is not as bad as that sensor, right?"
9364820,9370820," But it also is really bad because what if your reason for not being able to have an"
9370820,9374260," iPhone is your socioeconomic position?"
9374260,9378660," What if you got an Apple TV as a gift and this is just a giant FU for not being able"
9378660,9380620," to afford more?"
9380620,9382900," That's not cool either, right?"
9382900,9386580," So yeah, not cool."
9386580,9388580," Not cool, not even a little."
9388580,9393180," Yeah, maybe that's why Tim Cook's salary got cut."
9393180,9395220," It could be it."
9395220,9399980," Anywho, I think that was kind of all there was to say about that."
9399980,9402260," Oh, Alex has a note in here though."
9402260,9406500," I really hate that with Apple TV Plus, the service, not the device, the video quality"
9406500,9408860," settings are horrific unless you're watching on an Apple device."
9408860,9410700," Yeah, like that's the kind of thing."
9410700,9411900," Man, why is that necessary?"
9411900,9416060," Back when Apple used to make their keynotes only watchable on Apple devices until after,"
9416060,9420820," it's like what you don't want to sell to people who don't already have one?"
9420820,9428380," What kind of next level living up inside your own rectum universe do you exist in?"
9428380,9430980," What is your problem?"
9430980,9440060," Like it's not even that they're outside of their rights to do that they can, but that's"
9440060,9443620," just a whole thing to do."
9443620,9445740," Like just why?"
9445740,9446740," Ew."
9446740,9447740," Yeah."
9447740,9449380," Why would I buy anything from you?"
9449380,9451940," I would even talk to you."
9451940,9453940," Anyway."
9453940,9462660," Speaking of crazy things to do or alternative things to do, Wyoming plans to phase out EVs."
9462660,9463660," Weird."
9463660,9468060," Lots of other places are planning to phase out gas powered vehicles."
9468060,9475900," The Wyoming legislature passed a resolution to eliminate all sales of new EVs by 2035."
9475900,9479780," Legislators justified this move based on potential pollution from battery waste ending"
9479780,9485420," up in landfills and the importance of Wyoming's oil and gas sector."
9485420,9491100," Beyond that, they say that Wyoming is simply too empty and under populated to ever need"
9491100,9499700," EVs because there is only limited EV infrastructure consumers should be banned from buying them."
9499700,9503940," State Senator Brian Bonner?"
9503940,9504940," Good."
9504940,9505940," Nice recovery."
9505940,9506940," Good save."
9506940,9514940," Brian Bonner, the bill's sponsor, describes it as tongue in cheek, but a serious issue"
9514940,9516860," that deserves discussion."
9516860,9517860," Okay."
9517860,9521860," Well, it's still a bill."
9521860,9531220," The bill is purely symbolic and has no effect on the legal status of I'm genuinely confused."
9531220,9535940," It's pretty much just a way of."
9535940,9542380," If it bans a resolution, though, not a law."
9542380,9543780," So it's like something that goes."
9543780,9550540," It's kind of like when a country creates a resolution that they will reduce climate"
9550540,9551540," change by XML."
9551540,9553540," So it's a goal."
9553540,9554940," It's a New Year's resolution."
9554940,9555940," It's yes."
9555940,9556940," Got it."
9556940,9557940," Nothing will happen."
9557940,9558940," Nothing will change."
9558940,9559940," Yeah."
9559940,9563040," Okay."
9563040,9567780," It was mostly included because it was one of our topics for defending the indefensible."
9567780,9568780," God."
9568780,9569780," I don't know."
9569780,9570780," You know what?"
9570780,9573820," This is another thing that I've had some really good sort of conversations with Ivana"
9573820,9579980," Boat where she kind of goes, you know, for her."
9579980,9586140," I really like her sort of analysis of how polarization has gotten out of hand because"
9586140,9592940," it's a behavior that she's noticed in herself and in me over the years when we will argue."
9592940,9598240," You know, when we are legitimately taking up two different sides of an issue and she"
9598240,9603680," says, yeah, you know, what I have a tendency to do is when I feel like the other side of"
9603680,9612480," the argument has gone so far away from the truth, which often lies somewhere in the middle,"
9612480,9614960," is that I feel like I need to compensate."
9614960,9620680," You know, it's kind of like how if you've got a parent who's super, you know, angry all"
9620680,9626920," the time and abusive, the other one might feel pressure to try to make up for it."
9626920,9631680," Whereas if both took a more balanced approach, that might actually be healthier for the child."
9631680,9639800," And in the same way, if two sides of an issue were to attempt to see eye to eye on it rather"
9639800,9648680," than be sort of lured into these farther and farther extreme positions, we might have a"
9648680,9654520," chance of actually having a constructive conversation because the reality of it is that the upcoming"
9654520,9658840," avalanche of battery e-waste is a legitimate problem."
9658840,9663800," And how we harvest the minerals required to manufacture them is also like super horrible."
9663800,9669080," And where they're coming from is a super not okay is a legitimate problem."
9669080,9679000," The defense of the oil and gas sector is absolutely not a defensible reason for bringing it up."
9679000,9680000," Yeah."
9680000,9681200," They're deplorable too."
9681200,9685160," And like just because you don't like parts of one thing doesn't mean that you need to"
9685160,9691400," be 100% aligned with everything on the other side and yada yada."
9691400,9693360," Yeah."
9693360,9696760," So that's, that's all I have to say about that."
9696760,9697760," These are a huge problem."
9697760,9702800," When you actually talk about this on Wancho fairly often because I think probably around"
9702800,9707560," two years ago, it felt like every few months we'd hear some rumor about a new battery"
9707560,9708560," technology."
9708560,9709560," Do you remember this?"
9709560,9710560," Yeah."
9710560,9711560," I mean, they're still coming."
9711560,9713360," I mean, my school news feed is full of them."
9713360,9714360," Yeah."
9714360,9715360," Yeah."
9715360,9716360," Yeah."
9716360,9717360," All the time."
9717360,9718360," Yeah."
9718360,9719360," This, this was 1000 miles and blah, blah, blah, and it'll be perfectly recycled."
9719360,9720360," Yeah."
9720360,9721360," Where is it?"
9721360,9724480," The main thing we need is just something that doesn't require the same materials."
9724480,9728840," Like that's the materials required for current high end batteries is like, I like it."
9728840,9729840," That's fine."
9729840,9730840," That's problematic."
9730840,9731840," What?"
9731840,9732840," Current high end battery."
9732840,9733840," Okay."
9733840,9735480," No, I know that's a chance for you to get a cut."
9735480,9738080," But yeah, I don't, that's, that's a, it's a huge problem."
9738080,9742360," I mean, that's a big part of the argument for hydrogen fuel cells, right?"
9742360,9746760," Is that they're supposed to be, well, essentially they're supposed to just run on."
9746760,9747760," Why?"
9747760,9750000," I, I, I, that energy blah blah."
9750000,9751000," It's not true."
9751000,9752360," I know I get it."
9752360,9757280," But we can't, we can't reach an optimal solution if we aren't willing to at least consider"
9757280,9759160," the concerns of the other party."
9759160,9760160," Yeah."
9760160,9766000," Now, that's not to say that every concern from the other party is valid."
9766000,9768240," Also fair."
9768240,9769960," And that, that makes it very challenging."
9769960,9771400," But some of them maybe."
9771400,9772760," That makes it very challenging, right?"
9772760,9773760," Yeah."
9773760,9779720," What is valid is Google's move to make the Stadia controller usable."
9779720,9780720," Not so dead."
9780720,9783120," But the other after Stadia goes the way of the dodo."
9783120,9787320," They released a self service tool to enable Bluetooth on Stadia controllers."
9787320,9789200," Probably should have just supported it in the first place."
9789200,9790920," But hey, cool."
9790920,9795320," Bluetooth must be enabled before December 31st, 2023."
9795320,9796480," That's weird."
9796480,9797480," Why?"
9797480,9802240," Oh, okay."
9802240,9806120," While Stadia was compatible with most third party controllers, the rationale for the Stadia"
9806120,9809960," controller was that it could connect directly to Google servers via Wi-Fi, reducing latency,"
9809960,9810960," super cool."
9810960,9812240," But it won't do that anymore."
9812240,9816160," It'll just be Bluetooth, which is, I guess, also fine."
9816160,9820360," I think we can kind of switch over to some merch messages here."
9820360,9821360," Should we do that?"
9821360,9822360," Yeah."
9822360,9823360," All right."
9823360,9825360," Let's get into it."
9825360,9826880," I've got one here."
9826880,9829560," Oh, no, that we've already done."
9829560,9830560," Okay."
9830560,9831560," This one's from Austin."
9831560,9832560," Hey, I just wanted to bring--"
9832560,9833560," Wow."
9833560,9834560," Austin, Texas?"
9834560,9835560," The whole state."
9835560,9839920," Hey, I just wanted to bring up that I'm currently working at a fiber to home."
9839920,9844880," Well, ISP that is bringing 10 gig to residential in California at a reasonable price."
9844880,9847880," Some of my coworkers claim that it's not necessary."
9847880,9849120," What are your thoughts?"
9849120,9850120," It's not necessary."
9850120,9851120," Yeah."
9851120,9853600," Get what I want."
9853600,9855960," What the heck are you going to do with it?"
9855960,9856960," Have it."
9856960,9859600," What are you going to connect to?"
9859600,9862680," I just wanted."
9862680,9867840," Like, I actually-- no, I actually think this should have been on the defend the indefensible"
9867840,9873240," wheel because it is an indefensible position to say that you could need 10 gig internet"
9873240,9874240," at home today."
9874240,9878800," So you're poorly secured IoT device, because it's like DDoS the world?"
9878800,9883680," I mean, honestly though, like you could-- okay, let's go through the arguments, right?"
9883680,9886680," So that you could have lots of people there."
9886680,9889680," Well, realistically, you probably live in a single family dwelling."
9889680,9891240," You said it's residential."
9891240,9893760," So no, no actually the number--"
9893760,9897560," Well, it might not be lots of-- it might be lots of people, but it's not going to be"
9897560,9898560," like--"
9898560,9899560," The vast majority of the--"
9899560,9900560," Not an office building."
9900560,9905520," The vast majority of the services that you connect to, A, will not even have one gigabit"
9905520,9909120," of available uplink bandwidth to you."
9909120,9916000," And B, especially for things like web browsing are more likely to be limited by like DNS"
9916000,9919160," lookups than by the actual transfer speed."
9919160,9924520," Okay, number three, let's say you sail the high seas hard."
9924520,9925640," Okay?"
9925640,9927040," At that speed--"
9927040,9928040," Russian waves."
9928040,9932800," You are going to be spending-- you will not be able to work enough hours to afford the"
9932800,9939560," hard drives that you are going to need to contain all this data."
9939560,9945960," Everyone so far that saying that they want it says just because no one has a reason."
9945960,9949840," Well I get it, because when we got a 10 gig connection here, that was why I did it."
9949840,9953840," Yeah, I mean it's sick, but like, yes, it's-- okay, but--"
9953840,9955640," We have a hundred people here now."
9955640,9958240," So, yeah, we might actually use a lot of it."
9958240,9959240," Yeah, finally."
9959240,9960240," It was the question."
9960240,9964000," Yeah, the thing was claims that it's not necessary."
9964000,9965680," Of course it's not necessary."
9965680,9966680," Yeah."
9966680,9967680," Yeah."
9967680,9968680," All right."
9968680,9969680," Put it in anyway."
9969680,9970680," Sorry, Austin."
9970680,9972560," Are you guys actually opposed to being tech forward right now?"
9972560,9975320," This is A-prime, I'm sorry."
9975320,9976800," This is the I like waffles."
9976800,9982080," But you hate pancakes, argument, that is stupid, that is not what we said."
9982080,9984120," We said it's not necessary."
9984120,9985120," Yes."
9985120,9986720," We're saying it's not necessary."
9986720,9995120," By all means, let's get ready."
9995120,9996120," Yeah."
9996120,9997120," Let's do it."
9997120,9998120," Yeah, I don't know."
9998120,9999120," You know what?"
9999120,10003040," Stream 3D model files into whatever, who knows, I don't know."
10003040,10004040," Hot take."
10004040,10005040," Yeah."
10005040,10006040," Hot take."
10006040,10009280," We will never need a 10 gigabit home internet connection."
10009280,10010640," Yeah, that is a bad take."
10010640,10012960," I didn't say it was bad, I said it was hot."
10012960,10013960," Okay."
10013960,10015560," It's a lot because, okay."
10015560,10016560," Can I?"
10016560,10019120," The amount of water needed to put a note is not very much."
10019120,10020120," Are you going to give me a chance here?"
10020120,10023080," We need to have our time segments."
10023080,10024080," Can I talk?"
10024080,10025080," Sure."
10025080,10026080," All right."
10026080,10027080," Okay."
10027080,10032440," What are the primary drivers of bandwidth consumption now?"
10032440,10034440," Video?"
10034440,10036680," Yeah, I mean, yes."
10036680,10037680," Right."
10037680,10038680," This guy knows."
10038680,10039680," Look at his shirt."
10039680,10041480," Yeah, primary driver of bandwidth."
10041480,10042480," Okay."
10042480,10044440," He looks and stuff."
10044440,10047840," Right now we are at 4K, right?"
10047840,10048840," 3D."
10048840,10049840," Coming back?"
10049840,10050840," Probably not."
10050840,10051840," Okay."
10051840,10053720," We're at 4K."
10053720,10059920," We are at color depths that while not, we are at dynamic ranges and color depths that"
10059920,10064840," are not maxing out the capabilities of the eye, but we're starting to talk about the capabilities"
10064840,10065840," of the eye."
10065840,10066840," Fair enough?"
10066840,10067840," Okay."
10067840,10068840," Sure."
10068840,10070600," Okay."
10070600,10073000," We're a resolution, right?"
10073000,10082200," We could go further, but at what is considered to be, and even going back to the early days"
10082200,10090240," of projection theaters, at what is a ratio of your field of vision..."
10090240,10091240," I know what it's reading."
10091240,10092240," Ah."
10092240,10096920," At what is a ratio of your field of vision that is considered optimal to reduce motion"
10096920,10097920," sickness."
10097920,10098920," Okay."
10098920,10104400," So there is a solid argument to be made that 8K is unnecessary."
10104400,10105400," Okay."
10105400,10108840," And certainly anything beyond it will be triply unnecessary."
10108840,10109840," Can we counterpoint?"
10109840,10111240," Yeah, yeah, of course."
10111240,10115000," The type of data being consumed may change in the future."
10115000,10116800," You're saying you will never need it?"
10116800,10117800," Well, no, hold on."
10117800,10118800," Hold on."
10118800,10119800," Is that what you said?"
10119800,10124880," I am saying we will never need it, but what I'm trying to lay out is sort of the groundwork"
10124880,10125880," for..."
10125880,10126880," Sure."
10126880,10130520," ...about video, and you're talking about 2D frame video on a screen."
10130520,10131520," So far."
10131520,10132520," Okay."
10132520,10133520," But I haven't gotten there yet."
10133520,10134520," All right."
10134520,10135520," Okay."
10135520,10136520," So..."
10136520,10137520," We need timers."
10137520,10142520," If 8K is realistically, as far as we're going to get before, we've filled up too much"
10142520,10149920," of our field of vision and is no longer discernible anyway, then my argument is that we are kind"
10149920,10154240," of reaching a point where we can at least see the final destination."
10154240,10155240," Sort of."
10155240,10163360," There are two 8K images in stereoscopic 3D through a VR headset or through some kind of holographic"
10163360,10165360," projection system or whatever else it is."
10165360,10168360," You sure should know that it's not just resolution, though."
10168360,10170400," No, no, absolutely."
10170400,10171400," That's part of it."
10171400,10173000," That's not really that strong of an argument."
10173000,10179640," However, however, I mean, we already, we already, again, though, we know what that might look"
10179640,10180640," like."
10180640,10184640," So we are approaching the limits of what the eye can discern."
10184640,10188720," And we're sitting at like the highest bit rate blue rays or something in the neighborhood"
10188720,10190480," of 100 megabit."
10190480,10195960," So if we say, okay, 100 megabit times 4 is 400 megabit."
10195960,10202240," Times 2 is 800 megabit for a stream that is now stereoscopic."
10202240,10206960," And let's throw, let's go to gigabit, okay, to say, okay, we're going to need, we'll need"
10206960,10208640," more color depth than we have today."
10208640,10211120," It might come in bursts when you're buffering and stuff like that."
10211120,10214440," But even that isn't really enough to fill that pipe."
10214440,10215440," Not even close."
10215440,10216440," Yeah."
10216440,10218520," Not even a significant fraction."
10218520,10219520," Not even a little."
10219520,10224200," Now you could make the argument for a five user household."
10224200,10225480," All consuming that at once."
10225480,10227560," All consuming that at once."
10227560,10234080," I would counter that point by saying, I pretty much promise you that that experience for"
10234080,10239960," at least in our lifetimes is not going to be something that all five of those users are"
10239960,10244240," consuming in much the same way that right now you might have five people watching Netflix"
10244240,10245240," in the house."
10245240,10248400," I promise you, they're not all at 4K."
10248400,10252640," There, that's my argument."
10252640,10254800," Why are they not all at 4K?"
10254800,10257240," You just think one of them is on like a, yeah, so much like your device."
10257240,10258240," Almost probably on the phone."
10258240,10261000," So not every person has like a TV, basically."
10261000,10264680," Has a top, top of the line experience is kind of, I'm saying that I think."
10264680,10266240," You don't have five theater rooms."
10266240,10271840," The vast majority of households or whatever might have at most one of these, this peak"
10271840,10272840," tier experience."
10272840,10273840," Yeah."
10273840,10276080," So phones or laptops or computers or whatever else."
10276080,10277080," That's my argument."
10277080,10278080," Yeah."
10278080,10282520," So my thing I think would be new alternate experiences."
10282520,10289360," So yes, I do think we would have a hard time getting there in like flat frame video player"
10289360,10292000," type of content."
10292000,10297680," But I made like an offhand comment earlier about like streaming 3D models, whatever I"
10297680,10299280," wasn't describing it very well."
10299280,10301200," But that's sort of what I'm talking about."
10301200,10302200," Sure."
10302200,10308000," So high poly count complicated things being live streamed instead of rendered locally."
10308000,10314040," Game stream style to your house in more complex things that might not exist yet in regards"
10314040,10318720," to how we consume content could start hitting bandwidth levels pretty hard."
10318720,10321440," Count, I think it's super likely not really."
10321440,10327040," A lot of the market is going towards actually while we're increasing the, oh, you can get"
10327040,10328040," 10 gig to your house."
10328040,10332160," A lot of the market is going towards making it so that less data is being sent out."
10332160,10337200," Yeah, that's exactly where I was going to go to because at the end of the day, the higher"
10337200,10345600," the bigger the pipe between the service and the user, the more data was being stored."
10345600,10350840," And as we talked about in the video, yeah, in the video we did recently why YouTube should"
10350840,10353200," charge for 4K."
10353200,10360440," Basically, the trend that we were looking at was the way that storage is not getting"
10360440,10365440," cheaper anymore and you don't just like plug ethernet cables into hard drives either."
10365440,10369960," You need systems to run this data transfer to put things in packages, send them out,"
10369960,10370960," handle all that."
10370960,10372520," Now we will still get faster compute."
10372520,10375920," We will still get specialized encoders and decoders."
10375920,10384440," But, and that, but those will exist to minimize that data storage burden to minimize that data"
10384440,10386240," transmission burden."
10386240,10393160," No service, no company anywhere is looking to just use up more infrastructure."
10393160,10394160," Let's go."
10394160,10395480," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
10395480,10398520," It's not happening."
10398520,10400840," So that's my argument."
10400840,10402160," I'm saying it now."
10402160,10403360," This might be one of those."
10403360,10405600," I don't see Bitcoin going anywhere."
10405600,10411000," Moments, 10 years from now when everyone needs 10 gig to have the best gaming experience."
10411000,10417040," But you know what's funny is I might have even made a stronger argument for 10 gig back"
10417040,10424320," when we were back when game streaming was in its infancy and we couldn't really see"
10424320,10425640," the trajectory of it."
10425640,10434120," As it is now, I just, it's pretty clear that to keep latency down, compute has to stay"
10434120,10435120," down."
10435120,10442280," Data rates have to stay down and we are not going to see like an uncompressed, you know,"
10442280,10447240," 4K game stream product, not in a reasonable amount of time."
10447240,10448240," Yeah."
10448240,10450400," It's, this is a tangent thing."
10450400,10454280," I just want to say it before I get mobile gnome on the forum and also in flip-plane"
10454280,10461680," chat mentioned today is the fifth anniversary of the streak of WAN."
10461680,10465080," So a WAN show never being missed at all."
10465080,10466240," Oh, really?"
10466240,10467240," And it is."
10467240,10473840," And it is the 123rd episode in a row of Linus and Luke."
10473840,10474840," Nice."
10474840,10475840," Yeah."
10475840,10476840," We knew we had a streak."
10476840,10477840," We just weren't sure."
10477840,10478840," This didn't know what it was."
10478840,10479840," Yeah, we didn't know how long it was."
10479840,10480840," So it's over two years then."
10480840,10481840," Yeah."
10481840,10482840," Nice."
10482840,10483840," Yeah."
10483840,10484840," I'm not going to be the one to end it."
10484840,10485840," I'm either."
10485840,10486840," I'm clearly."
10486840,10489520," Yeah, he's on vacation right now."
10489520,10490520," No, not today."
10490520,10491520," Oh, not today."
10491520,10492520," I was on."
10492520,10493520," Oh, okay."
10493520,10494520," All right."
10494520,10495520," It was up until yesterday."
10495520,10496520," Got it."
10496520,10497520," Yeah."
10497520,10498520," All right."
10498520,10499520," So it's technically back at work."
10499520,10500520," That's good."
10500520,10501520," Yeah."
10501520,10502520," All right, Dan hit us."
10502520,10503520," Okay."
10503520,10506480," This one is from anonymous in the future."
10506480,10511040," Would you create an add on like honey, but warns us when we check out trying to buy"
10511040,10518400," an item that you have tested with labs to not live up to their claimed expectations."
10518400,10520200," That's a pretty cool idea."
10520200,10528320," I could see man, I could see a third party websites getting super mad, like especially"
10528320,10533800," if we got into the business event, like selling those products or whatever else, like a competitor,"
10533800,10538960," basically, like warning customers on your website that you shouldn't buy something from"
10538960,10539960," them."
10539960,10542960," That seems maybe that's even man, how would we be?"
10542960,10543960," Yeah."
10543960,10545960," We couldn't do it for segments that we."
10545960,10549640," Yeah, for that we participate in, but in ones that we didn't or maybe if we just never"
10549640,10554200," did that, then that could be a pretty cool alternative business model for it where we"
10554200,10561280," basically just go, Hey, here's a link to add one with our affiliate code, obviously,"
10561280,10566320," from this very same site that we recommend."
10566320,10567320," That's pretty cool."
10567320,10572760," I don't know that labs is going to want to make such concrete individual product recommendations,"
10572760,10573760," though."
10573760,10574760," So that's a challenge."
10574760,10581880," You might be able to suggest possible alternatives, but we could maybe use the commonly compared"
10581880,10582880," against tool."
10582880,10583880," Yeah."
10583880,10589400," Yeah, but like, oh man, especially for so many products or down to personal taste, right?"
10589400,10593880," Like headphones are one of the classic ones because that's one of the one of the product"
10593880,10597600," categories that we're going to be best set up for very early on print on a certain sound"
10597600,10598600," signature."
10598600,10599600," Yeah."
10599600,10602200," And then just like, or you might have a weird shape dome."
10602200,10603200," Yep."
10603200,10605800," Like, you know, that one's honestly better for you."
10605800,10610080," So we would always need to be really careful about making a solid recommendation on someone"
10610080,10615240," else's website where the return is going to be their liability and not our own, right?"
10615240,10617360," So there's like kind of ethical challenges there too."
10617360,10618360," I don't know."
10618360,10620720," We'd have to figure out the best way to deal with that."
10620720,10621720," Yeah."
10621720,10622720," Yeah."
10622720,10623720," Okay."
10623720,10629600," Hey guys, recently just started my first full-time job in networking for a very large group."
10629600,10634080," We've been chucked in the deep end, any advice for dealing with the incredible information"
10634080,10638480," overload that comes with starting a new job in an unfamiliar field."
10638480,10639480," Read the docs, man."
10639480,10640480," Yeah, go for it."
10640480,10641480," Go for it."
10641480,10642480," Go hard."
10642480,10643480," Go hard."
10643480,10644480," That's all I can really say."
10644480,10645640," He said large organizations."
10645640,10647920," So hopefully there's docs."
10647920,10654720," If there aren't docs, networking stuff."
10654720,10655720," Wow."
10655720,10660680," If there aren't docs, stay there long enough to get good experience and look for a new"
10660680,10661680," job."
10661680,10662680," Thanks."
10662680,10669640," Stay long enough that it looks good on the resume and not bad."
10669640,10671200," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
10671200,10676240," Or just press a huge amount of importance that you need to make them and be the one"
10676240,10679680," to champion the creation of them because you need that."
10679680,10687800," Like creating systems is almost always a higher position in the org chart than just following"
10687800,10690280," created systems, almost always."
10690280,10695440," I got a couple of messages in the chat here that I want to highlight here."
10695440,10699840," Recon Messenger says, \"Speaking of headphones, what headphones are Linus and Luke using?"
10699840,10706880," They're AT, something, M50, X, they suck."
10706880,10708200," They're uncomfortable."
10708200,10715560," There was this whole trendy thing for a while where everyone was super hard on for these"
10715560,10718600," and at the time I didn't understand it."
10718600,10720280," I still don't understand it."
10720280,10723080," They were always commodity."
10723080,10726520," I think the argument was they're used in recording studios."
10726520,10730840," Yeah, they're used in recording studios because they're basically disposable."
10730840,10731840," Yeah."
10731840,10734200," If you're going to break them, you don't get the good ones."
10734200,10736240," You had a box of these."
10736240,10739800," You got musicians, you just throw them at them and they wear them and if you destroy"
10739800,10741720," them then you just give them another one."
10741720,10745880," Yeah, so someone, they're also close back so they're nice and isolating."
10745880,10753560," Someone grabbed onto that little like factoid that these are used in recording studios,"
10753560,10758880," completely missed the context, had absolutely no idea what headphones are supposed to sound"
10758880,10762000," like and was like, \"BEEP\""
10762000,10763000," \"Suck.\""
10763000,10764000," Yeah."
10764000,10765000," Let's go."
10765000,10766000," Do they do the..."
10766000,10767000," Yeah, they do."
10767000,10768000," Yes, they do."
10768000,10775600," They're here because they are cheap and disposable and we needed four pairs for the, they're just"
10775600,10778560," movies, podcasts and stuff and they were cheap."
10778560,10780560," They're good enough."
10780560,10781560," Yeah."
10781560,10786880," And then in the float plane chat from Jake, Luke doesn't put his camera up during our"
10786880,10788760," twice a week stand-ups."
10788760,10792160," We can hear him chewing but he blames the birds."
10792160,10794120," How would you like to respond to that?"
10794120,10795120," I just..."
10795120,10796800," You've been outed, sir."
10796800,10800400," Every call I do that's wrong is the bird's fault."
10800400,10802600," No, I don't know."
10802600,10804520," I can put it on Jake."
10804520,10805520," Okay."
10805520,10806520," Jeez."
10806520,10810520," I don't have a dog that I can cuddle like you do in yours."
10810520,10811520," All right."
10811520,10812520," Oh, I love it."
10812520,10813520," Okay."
10813520,10814520," All right, Dan, hit us."
10814520,10815520," All right, this is from Ari."
10815520,10818880," \"People who say your merch is overpriced have never worn it."
10818880,10820320," Thanks for making nice quality clothes."
10820320,10824080," For my question, what fictional technology do you wish you could?"
10824080,10825080," Could review.\""
10825080,10826080," Oh, man."
10826080,10829640," This is a cool one."
10829640,10836000," How much fun would it be to review like the Star Trek beam me up, whatever those are"
10836000,10838080," called, teleporters or whatever."
10838080,10841600," Like, \"Oh, no, no, no, the food fabricators.\""
10841600,10844000," Oh, yeah."
10844000,10849600," That's the kind of technology that is going to go through a period of being absolutely"
10849600,10850600," horrible."
10850600,10851600," That's ferocious."
10851600,10858560," A short period of being horrible, a long period of being kind of acceptable, and then they're"
10858560,10861280," going to get really good and things are going to get really interesting."
10861280,10862280," Yeah."
10862280,10863280," Yeah, yeah."
10863280,10867800," Just grind up cockroaches into it and it spits out a burger and you're going to be"
10867800,10868800," like, \"How did they do this?"
10868800,10869800," It's going to be awesome.\""
10869800,10872880," My brain immediately went to lightsabers."
10872880,10875840," There's material stuff because how does the grip feel?"
10875840,10876840," It's style."
10876840,10877840," Stuff like that."
10877840,10878840," There's a lot of style involved."
10878840,10883480," But then there's also crystal choice and like, \"Yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada.\""
10883480,10884760," I just, I don't know."
10884760,10886200," My brain immediately went to that."
10886200,10887200," All right."
10887200,10889120," Nerds, the La Dia."
10889120,10892560," This one's from James with multiple LMG branches, EG Labs."
10892560,10896880," Would you consider creating a team to investigate shady practices by tech companies?"
10896880,10901200," For example, Activision's broken anti-cheat that bans innocent players and their lack"
10901200,10903040," of response/appeal process?"
10903040,10907160," I mean, I think that in the longer term, we obviously, yeah, we want to cover the industry"
10907160,10910920," from every direction that we can."
10910920,10914360," But I don't know that we would have a dedicated team just for shady practices."
10914360,10921160," I think that you can expect to see, especially if talk linked and tech longer, see some success."
10921160,10925160," I think you could expect to see us build out that team in order to do more content like"
10925160,10926160," that."
10926160,10927960," Tech Link is our news."
10927960,10932080," I was going to say news group, but it's not a news group."
10932080,10933240," That's a different thing."
10933240,10938760," But that's kind of our news focused group right now."
10938760,10942120," I don't know."
10942120,10943920," It's not a top priority on the roadmap."
10943920,10946720," I think the next thing you're going to see from us is a React's channel."
10946720,10952280," And the next thing is you're going to see after that are going to be more product focused"
10952280,10954920," stuff as we build up the lab."
10954920,10956920," Okay."
10956920,10959920," And now I have a bit of an interesting one here."
10959920,10963600," Can you explain the need behind improving Wancho?"
10963600,10969520," One big draw for me was Wancho was the lack of gimmicky slapstick nonsense like the spinning"
10969520,10970520," wheel."
10970520,10973320," I'd love to understand your thoughts driving it."
10973320,10978240," I thought this was pretty mean, but also probably quite an interesting discussion."
10978240,10984560," I spoke with a few of the other team members yesterday and it's kind of nice."
10984560,10988320," What?"
10988320,10991920," You spoke with a few of the other team members yesterday and it was kind of nice."
10991920,10992920," Yeah."
10992920,10997520," Hearing Linus' maybe thoughts behind improving the Wancho."
10997520,10998520," Oh, okay."
10998520,10999520," The Wancho."
10999520,11000520," That's a..."
11000520,11002560," Stance for a long time has been, don't touch it, including with the thumbnails for the"
11002560,11008480," Wancho being kind of generally extremely old age YouTube and they've never grown or gotten"
11008480,11009480," better."
11009480,11013280," And people have offered to like, hey, maybe we should make better thumbnails for it."
11013280,11016120," And it's always just been like, no."
11016120,11018680," So I'm a little bit surprised by the change."
11018680,11024120," I'm surprised that you're saying that you like that the show has never been like gimmicky"
11024120,11028400," or jank because I think that's all the show has ever been."
11028400,11034320," I guess not technically gimmicks in this form, but like it's never been professional."
11034320,11037560," It's a little gimmicky, I guess."
11037560,11038560," Sure."
11038560,11041640," It's not slapstick though and it creates very interesting discussions."
11041640,11044920," Is the show in general not just kind of slapsticky?"
11044920,11045920," We've made slapstick."
11045920,11048280," That has a kind of specific definition."
11048280,11049280," Does it?"
11049280,11050760," I genuinely don't know what it is, I guess."
11050760,11053400," I thought it was just like..."
11053400,11057040," Like slapstick would be like visual gags and stuff like that."
11057040,11058040," Oh, okay."
11058040,11059040," Yeah."
11059040,11060040," And this would be a gimmick."
11060040,11061040," That is a bit."
11061040,11062040," For sure."
11062040,11063040," I'm just..."
11063040,11064040," I'm in listening mode right now though."
11064040,11065040," I mean, I don't know."
11065040,11066760," I'll give my two cents, but..."
11066760,11072880," I feel like we've been on a very good arc for a while."
11072880,11077000," I think the beginning of that arc was probably the beginning of merch messages."
11077000,11083120," I don't know how it happened, but the show as a whole changed, not just the inclusion"
11083120,11084600," of merch messages."
11084600,11088000," It's really long now, so that's interesting."
11088000,11090200," There's no shortage of content."
11090200,11092280," I think that's a big part of it."
11092280,11094400," Because of merch messages, to be completely honest."
11094400,11096720," Yeah, but you guys make the show what it is."
11096720,11101480," Because like the same thing happened to Wanshow that happened to LTT, where when Linus and"
11101480,11105280," I first started way back in the day, there was too much stuff to cover."
11105280,11111880," So we just covered the things that showed up at the door, and there was always enough"
11111880,11113200," content."
11113200,11118600," And then over time, the amount of things that showed up at the door reduced, because the"
11118600,11123560," frenzy of tech being in a relatively early stage kind of stopped."
11123560,11126720," And then it happened with phones and then that fell off."
11126720,11130080," And then it started becoming a situation where like, okay, well, there isn't enough"
11130080,11133880," new stuff to cover, so we have to create new content."
11133880,11137600," So we started creating shows, and we started creating different content types and experiments"
11137600,11138600," and whatever else."
11138600,11142680," Building things that were more dependent on the personality rather than the product"
11142680,11143680," that we were covering."
11143680,11146000," Yeah, so that changed over time."
11146000,11150960," Similar thing happened to Wanshow, where there used to be just this infinite pool of"
11150960,11156040," tech news that we could cover, and we would just grab the best parts of it."
11156040,11160840," And over time, it got to the point where it's like, wow, there's really not a lot to talk"
11160840,11162360," about this week."
11162360,11164040," How do we make this interesting?"
11164040,11167000," And we just started going off the rail more."
11167000,11171440," And then with merch messages, you guys kind of throw us off the rail, which I think is"
11171440,11172520," even more interesting."
11172520,11175240," So I think we've been on a good track."
11175240,11181160," I don't see necessarily the need to change things when we've been on probably the best"
11181160,11183680," track that we've been on for a while."
11183680,11185600," But I didn't mind the wheel."
11185600,11189200," I thought it was interesting."
11189200,11193040," I think the wheel can't be an every week thing."
11193040,11194520," No, it would be."
11194520,11198160," Because it depends on there being topics that make sense to be on the wheel, and it depends"
11198160,11200320," on there being enough of them."
11200320,11203800," But I don't see anything against it."
11203800,11212040," I don't think working to make something better is a bad thing."
11212040,11213040," So yeah."
11213040,11214040," Okay."
11214040,11218280," Well, thank you for having my-- I've typed up some of my things."
11218280,11220600," That was sort of where I was going to land on."
11220600,11222680," But I'll tell you some of the other things."
11222680,11227080," So I can tell you right now, the reason we've not changed Wanshow in the past is not because"
11227080,11229400," we haven't had ideas for how to make it better."
11229400,11230400," It's because--"
11230400,11233040," We're going to hire someone."
11233040,11235240," I'm cheap."
11235240,11243240," And Wanshow is the lowest possible priority thing to spend money on in the entire company."
11243240,11246880," Wanshow is literally at the very bottom of the totem pole."
11246880,11253720," I would rather pay for cleaning services for the year for every employee of the company"
11253720,11257320," than hire someone who's dedicated to Wanshow."
11257320,11258520," That has happened."
11258520,11259680," That happened."
11259680,11260680," Yeah."
11260680,11262680," Traditionally."
11262680,11267200," I'm trying to explain what my position has been on Wanshow."
11267200,11271880," Wanshow came about as a necessary evil."
11271880,11272880," I like filler."
11272880,11276160," It killed two birds with one stone."
11276160,11280920," Bird number one was it gave us some kind of foothold into live, which at the time it"
11280920,11286080," wasn't clear to me how that was going to evolve and how meaningful it was going to"
11286080,11287080," be."
11287080,11290560," But it was a trend and it was something that was not going away."
11290560,11293520," And we needed some kind of presence in live."
11293520,11298600," And I was like, OK, well, the easiest, lowest hanging fruit at a time in my life when I"
11298600,11302280," have an infant child in a fledgling company is Q&A."
11302280,11303520," So that's how it starts."
11303520,11308160," And then from Q&A, well, people just started asking about what's going on in the tech world."
11308160,11315080," So it's not that much of a leap to go from just trying to preemptively answer the questions"
11315080,11319400," that you would have had, which is what's my take on X, Y, or Z in the tech world."
11319400,11320400," Right."
11320400,11322560," So Wanshow served that purpose."
11322560,11327200," And then the second purpose it served was it was killing us trying to upload seven LTTs"
11327200,11333560," a week."
11333560,11340960," And because it was live and because we branded it as a podcast, it was easy to sell to sponsors"
11340960,11346960," for, if not the same rates, at least a close enough rate compared to what we could charge"
11346960,11355960," for LTT videos that we could afford to not do an LTT video that day at only the cost"
11355960,11361400," of about an hour and a half of each mine in Luke's time, which so it was a very, it was"
11361400,11365200," a very calculated move, the creation of Wanshow."
11365200,11373560," As for why it was a low priority to improve it, well, it's because Wanshow morphed into"
11373560,11380560," the one way that we can really engage with the community and kind of touch base with"
11380560,11386480," you guys on a weekly basis and to serve that purpose, Wanshow doesn't need a fancy set."
11386480,11388120," It doesn't need better lights."
11388120,11391200," It doesn't need 4K cameras."
11391200,11394480," It doesn't need really anything."
11394480,11399000," We are not going to be more professional on the show."
11399000,11403480," So making the show more professional doesn't necessarily make a lot of sense and could"
11403480,11405720," even contribute to making it seem less genuine."
11405720,11410960," So I have this thing that has kind of this ceiling for how much we can charge for it"
11410960,11412440," from a sponsorship standpoint."
11412440,11416480," So from a business point of view, I can invest more in it."
11416480,11418960," I will not get a return on it."
11418960,11423080," And then from a personal point of view, I was just like, I don't know, Wanshow's fun."
11423080,11425800," And it's fun the way it is."
11425800,11430920," However, there are a few things that have prompted this recent change."
11430920,11434840," So first of all, I want to make it clear that our new Wanshow writer, I guess I'll call"
11434840,11436120," it a writing position."
11436120,11443720," Our new Wanshow writers primary raison d'etre is not to create gimmicky nonsense."
11443720,11449880," Their primary purpose is to make sure that the stories we have for the week are better"
11449880,11451920," fleshed out and more accurate."
11451920,11457760," I think we are reaching the point where there's just no excuse for us to get details wrong."
11457760,11463720," And honestly, I think it's fair to say that the quality of, while the titles might still"
11463720,11469920," be kind of inflammatory, the quality of the way the topics are written out is better than"
11469920,11471680," what we've had in the past."
11471680,11473720," I think it's been pretty balanced."
11473720,11476560," I think there's some areas where there could be some improvement."
11476560,11480120," But realistically, this is the first week of actually preparing the doc for us."
11480120,11484320," So great job."
11484320,11489160," As for why I do want part of their job to be gimmicks and segments and stuff like that,"
11489160,11491600," well, because I think they're fun."
11491600,11494640," There's nothing wrong with trying new things, like Luke said."
11494640,11499240," And a big part of the inspiration for these segments is the success of the merch messages"
11499240,11500920," segment."
11500920,11506720," You guys might not have realized it, but we totally created this gimmicky way to interact"
11506720,11510800," with the show that has actually ended up making the show a more fun for us."
11510800,11514000," Like I never would have even wanted to do a three hour Wanshow before, but now I kind"
11514000,11515960," of enjoy it."
11515960,11520000," Like at a certain point, I'm hungry now and I kind of have to pee, but like, you know,"
11520000,11521400," it didn't really look like there's a lot of fun."
11521400,11522400," There's a limit, right?"
11522400,11527160," But I enjoy it more and that's why the show is longer."
11527160,11530880," And I know you guys enjoy it more because I can see it in the analytics."
11530880,11533360," So it's working for both of us."
11533360,11538240," So let's do it."
11538240,11542520," So we're going to try stuff and sometimes it'll land and sometimes it'll be crap and"
11542520,11546920," we won't do it again."
11546920,11547920," Hit me, Dan."
11547920,11548920," Okay."
11548920,11549920," Excellent."
11549920,11550920," This is from Denver."
11550920,11551920," Really?"
11551920,11552920," Yeah."
11552920,11553920," The whole city."
11553920,11554920," There's another one."
11554920,11556760," The best city in Denver."
11556760,11560320," I need 10 gig for three to one backups."
11560320,11561640," You don't need it."
11561640,11567680," I want 4K 3D and want to move past the draconian 30 and 60 Hertz paradigm."
11567680,11568680," That's not a cool one."
11568680,11570320," Wait, you say I want 4K 3D."
11570320,11571320," 4K 3D."
11571320,11573080," 120,000 Hertz."
11573080,11576120," Okay, but you can want it, but that doesn't make it exist."
11576120,11581840," If you're going to watch that one video, you could just download it."
11581840,11584560," My home internet is 40 gig."
11584560,11591560," And other than transceivers, fibers fiber be it one gig, 10 gig, even 100 gig."
11591560,11595400," Yes, but I never oppose building out fiber."
11595400,11598760," I said you don't need a 10 gig."
11598760,11603160," I don't know why this is so hard for people."
11603160,11610600," But the thing we were talking about was if it was necessary for the user to have 10 gig"
11610600,11611600," in the home."
11611600,11615920," And I would also make the argument that if you are a 3-2-1 backing up something with"
11615920,11624040," that kind of data requirements on a daily basis, that sounds like it is not home use."
11624040,11630760," So while you are technically at a residential address, I am going to stand by my original"
11630760,11633560," statement and I'm going to say you are not a home user."
11633560,11634560," There."
11634560,11635560," Yeah."
11635560,11640840," We're talking about if it was necessary, there is a bunch of which has to come first"
11640840,11644920," type of questions with this type of stuff where if you wanted to build a service that"
11644920,11650280," needs those types of bandwidth requirements, well no company is going to do that if no"
11650280,11654240," one is able to receive that type of data."
11654240,11659880," So we would need home users to be able to have things like 10 gig in place."
11659880,11666880," The plans would need to be available so that a company could make something that actually"
11666880,11668880," uses that whole pipe."
11668880,11672240," So it is not a bad thing to do."
11672240,11675640," It is just for the user it is not necessary right now."
11675640,11676640," That is all."
11676640,11677640," Okay."
11677640,11678640," Here is one from James."
11678640,11679640," Hi Linus."
11679640,11683280," I would like to go to LTX but my wife is giving birth to our first born."
11683280,11684280," My wife."
11684280,11685280," My wife."
11685280,11689600," I forgot he was going to do that to our first born in late March."
11689600,11693480," Do you have any tips for traveling with a newborn and should I take my four month son"
11693480,11694480," to LTX?"
11694480,11695480," No."
11695480,11696480," No."
11696480,11699120," You would have to drive 14 hours to get to LTX."
11699120,11700120," No, just don't."
11700120,11705560," I traveled with a newborn a couple times and it sucked every time."
11705560,11706560," No one had fun."
11706560,11707560," Come later."
11707560,11709400," I'll see you next year."
11709400,11710400," Yeah."
11710400,11711400," Yeah."
11711400,11712400," I'm sorry man."
11712400,11715880," I wish I did have some tips for you."
11715880,11717280," We're into potentials now."
11717280,11718280," Okay right."
11718280,11719280," Sorry."
11719280,11720280," Sorry."
11720280,11727080," I might have to just do these then because if I have to read them anyway then okay anonymous"
11727080,11730040," says when you plead Beat Saber do you feel that external tracking like with the valve"
11730040,11734160," index works better than internal tracking like with the quest to my saber sometimes"
11734160,11738880," float away from my hand in the quest to so there are always going to be technical limitations"
11738880,11746120," when it comes to occlusion which is when your sensor and your object are occluded that"
11746120,11749040," is there's an object between them of some sort."
11749040,11753440," You can make up a lot of ground with really accurate accelerometers and gyroscopes like"
11753440,11756360," valve valve excuse me."
11756360,11763920," Meta does build into their controllers but those are inherently going to drift."
11763920,11764920," They do."
11764920,11765920," They must."
11765920,11766920," They will."
11766920,11771880," So there's that you're always going to need to kind of snap them back to reality."
11771880,11774720," There goes gravity you know."
11774720,11778400," Every once in a while like like really a lot."
11778400,11784960," External trackers especially for full body tracking I mean I think they will always have"
11784960,11791600," an advantage whether that advantage is enough to justify the additional cost and space and"
11791600,11796680," wiring requirements and maybe not maybe the next valve headset is going to make me regret"
11796680,11801280," drilling a bunch of holes in my rec room to put up lighthouses."
11801280,11808840," But yeah so for full body tracking it's not really an option for me to use inside out"
11808840,11813320," for now because I have a sensor on my waist it sensors on my feet sensors on my hands"
11813320,11816400," and sensors on my head from the headset you're just not going to be able to see them all"
11816400,11821400," and and maintain the natural movement for my avatar."
11821400,11825920," But if I was not doing full body tracking then yeah I think an array could be built"
11825920,11830160," that's good enough even if the current stuff is not quite there yet especially at the consumer"
11830160,11831160," level."
11831160,11834480," Okay got another one."
11834480,11838120," Hey Linus and Luke I usually watch the mansion on Saturday mornings and wanted to thank you"
11838120,11839640," for the content."
11839640,11844880," What's your favorite dad joke?"
11844880,11849360," I think the best dad jokes aren't like fixed I think they're just constant puns."
11849360,11855440," Yeah it's got to be people well I mean actually the social team asked me to tell a dad joke"
11855440,11859200," for for a float plane exclusive and I was like you don't you don't come up with it on"
11859200,11860200," the spot."
11860200,11866000," Yeah like I constantly I'm telling dad jokes but it's because that's what makes it a"
11866000,11867000," dad joke."
11867000,11868840," Yeah my brain's just actually wired that way."
11868840,11873920," I have heard people that have like recitable dad jokes but I don't think that's very common"
11873920,11876120," I think most of them are just play on word."
11876120,11882240," Yeah and what's funny about them is the way that you've gone and interpreted something"
11882240,11886920," that that person said 45 seconds ago."
11886920,11891160," And like the ah I knew it was going to be something that just happened but I would not"
11891160,11893560," have gone there with it you know."
11893560,11897080," I'm sorry I'm sorry I don't I don't have something."
11897080,11900800," I got to address something in chat because people still don't understand and that's okay"
11900800,11902600," but I got to address it."
11902600,11906440," What about when a game is a one terabyte download?"
11906440,11910200," What about when it is download it?"
11910200,11915560," If the game server is still incapable of actually sending you what your pipe is capable of"
11915560,11923240," receiving then it's irrelevant and are they going to send you 10 gigs a second to just"
11923240,11924240," you?"
11924240,11930360," Yeah not just you to everyone who has a connection like that good luck."
11930360,11936760," Ever maybe foreseeable future near future near future I seriously doubt it."
11936760,11938360," Yeah but I want it."
11938360,11939360," Oh my gosh."
11939360,11940360," You can want it."
11940360,11942960," We're talking about is it necessary."
11942960,11943960," No."
11943960,11946320," Okay cool moving forward."
11946320,11948520," James asks Linus do you code?"
11948520,11950360," The answer is no."
11950360,11959880," Sorry I just never I never learned and realistically I'm at a point in my life running the company"
11959880,11963480," with the kids blah blah blah where if I was going to pick up something it'd probably be"
11963480,11967920," like a musical instrument or something at this point."
11967920,11971880," Like I just I don't think that would be my next endeavor."
11971880,11976560," I think I would probably want to learn enough to be dangerous like just you know simple"
11976560,11981520," things like scripting but then with chat GPT being as powerful as it is I mean yeah I"
11981520,11985040," guess I'd like to know enough to be able to like proofread like a chat GPT script."
11985040,11990280," Oh I was just gonna say I think right now okay not right now I think in the near future"
11990280,11994600," a more usable goal would be able to understand."
11994600,11995760," Yeah."
11995760,11997880," Being able to try to."
11997880,11999560," To read it even if I can't write it."
11999560,12000560," And debug things."
12000560,12001560," Sure."
12001560,12006160," At least this is why I'm tripping right now is I don't necessarily think that you should"
12006160,12010000," be able to fix it but I think you should be able to understand why it's not working so"
12010000,12012920," you can ask chat GPT to fix it."
12012920,12018000," Because I've had code outputs from chat GPT that I've been like oh it's getting this error"
12018000,12021600," and I think it's because of this can you fix that and it'll be like yep and it'll actually"
12021600,12022600," do it."
12022600,12024560," So like that doesn't really require a lot."
12024560,12025560," Sure."
12025560,12027800," And as long as you are familiar with the tools and stuff and get it to do that then you'll"
12027800,12028800," be fine."
12028800,12033400," A certain amount of like human nature that leads us to kind of take the easiest solution"
12033400,12034760," to a problem."
12034760,12042320," And for me the easiest solution to a coding problem is to go to one of the over a dozen"
12042320,12048560," like professional capable programmers that I have at my disposal now and say hey can you"
12048560,12051320," help me with this."
12051320,12054000," Like learning that's a dangerous thing."
12054000,12059400," And I think that's where a lot of the kind of the stereotypical dumb know nothing executive"
12059400,12069440," kind of comes from is that when it's so much faster and your time is so so pressed when"
12069440,12072080," it's so much faster, easier and more efficient."
12072080,12073920," It's not efficient for you to learn things."
12073920,12076400," It's not efficient to learn."
12076400,12078520," Learning is super inefficient."
12078520,12082600," The good news for me is I get bored and I get frustrated and like depressed when I'm"
12082600,12083600," not learning things."
12083600,12086920," So I'm just I'm sort of self motivated to keep doing it."
12086920,12092120," But if I wasn't if I didn't just have a joy of learning, I feel like I'd already just"
12092120,12098520," be like kind of useless, you know, like I like there is no reason for me to know anything"
12098520,12100720," about how cameras operate."
12100720,12104080," There is always someone to do it for me."
12104080,12110680," However, when the pandemic shutdown came along, what I discovered was that just because I"
12110680,12116200," tend to be naturally curious, I had actually absorbed enough that is it as good as our"
12116200,12118120," people who do it every day all day?"
12118120,12119120," No, of course not."
12119120,12123000," I'm not going to pretend it is, but it was did the channel survive?"
12123000,12124000," Did we miss an?"
12124000,12125840," I think so."
12125840,12126840," All right."
12126840,12131160," So clearly I managed to I managed to gain a serviceable enough knowledge that I was able"
12131160,12134640," to set it up myself."
12134640,12138320," And so I don't remember what the question was."
12138320,12144480," No, I'm not going to learn to code because that's it's something that I have almost no"
12144480,12148240," need to interact with on a daily basis."
12148240,12152640," Whereas like cameras, I really do even if I'm usually on this side of them and they're"
12152640,12157640," usually on the other side of them."
12157640,12158640," The next one is for me."
12158640,12162840," So this question for Luke, what is your biggest struggle as a new dev after graduation?"
12162840,12167360," I'm coming up on two years after school and I'm struggling to find a motivation to pursue"
12167360,12172600," learning/projects on my own time due to life obligations."
12172600,12180680," Well interesting question for me because A, I didn't graduate and B, after school I was"
12180680,12185640," immediately doing things that had nothing to do with software development at all."
12185640,12189440," And also while I was in school, I was doing a lot of things that had nothing to do with"
12189440,12192240," software development at all."
12192240,12200440," So I don't know, it doesn't sound like your problem is necessarily finding work or working."
12200440,12204120," It sounds like your problem is finding motivation to sort of learn learning and projects on"
12204120,12205120," your own time."
12205120,12206360," And/or work/life balance."
12206360,12207720," And/or work/life balance."
12207720,12210600," That is a totally separate question."
12210600,12213240," Motivation is an interesting thing in its own right."
12213240,12218520," I don't find motivation to be in my own personal experience and you're asking me so I'm going"
12218520,12219520," to answer it this way."
12219520,12222200," And I don't know if this is legit for everyone, I don't know."
12222200,12227200," I don't find motivation in what most people see from that or take from that word to be"
12227200,12229440," super useful to me personally."
12229440,12233720," I find dedication or discipline to be super useful to me personally."
12233720,12239960," Motivation seems like a burst thing and something that's only useful for a short period of time."
12239960,12244320," You can just hope that you'll have it whereas if dedication is something you can control."
12244320,12250760," Yeah, so like you need to employ discipline or something to make yourself do those things"
12250760,12253040," if those are things that you need to do."
12253040,12254040," Big if."
12254040,12255040," You might not need to."
12255040,12259320," You might just be able to go to work, do your job, go home and not do these types of things."
12259320,12260560," You don't have to."
12260560,12265120," I know it's very popular in the space and I'm not saying it's a bad thing to be super"
12265120,12266200," clear."
12266200,12268760," But you don't have to do that stuff outside of work."
12268760,12269920," You don't need homework."
12269920,12271400," You're now graduated."
12271400,12275440," You could go to work, do your job, go home and not do it anymore."
12275440,12280160," But if you feel like you should or if you want to for career advancement reasons or"
12280160,12286520," whatever, I would use what motivation you do have to set up a situation where you're"
12286520,12294400," able to use something like determination, discipline, those types of things to actually"
12294400,12300080," get that stuff done."
12300080,12301080," That's it."
12301080,12306600," I've kind of addressed this topic on Wancho before and I hope I did it better this time."
12306600,12310640," But yeah, like if you need to get something done, motivation is not the right thing in"
12310640,12317880," my opinion to look towards because it's a resource that definitely depletes and you"
12317880,12320080," need to find more rigid things to be able to lean on."
12320080,12321400," Or at least I do."
12321400,12323160," Again, they asked me."
12323160,12328240," Delta Braga Man says, \"Here's what chat GPT had to say regarding 10 gigabit per second"
12328240,12329240," internet.\""
12329240,12330240," I was hoping someone would do this."
12330240,12334360," First, it would enable multiple users in the household to engage in high band with activities"
12334360,12338440," simultaneously such as streaming, 4K video gaming and teleconferencing without any lag"
12338440,12339440," or buffering."
12339440,12342600," Second, it would enable faster download and upload speeds which would be beneficial for"
12342600,12347200," tasks such as working from home, online learning and remote backups."
12347200,12350800," Therefore, it would be necessary."
12350800,12354760," And chat GPT can be confidently wrong."
12354760,12356800," Yeah, that's all we managed to prove there."
12356800,12357800," I'm afraid."
12357800,12358800," That's a one out of 10 there."
12358800,12361840," [LAUGHTER]"
12361840,12366720," Nicholas B, \"I watched Pure Living for Life's video on their horrifying cyberbullying story."
12366720,12370840," How can you to be an engaging, relatable, and successful YouTube world keeping your life"
12370840,12373080," private from your community?\""
12373080,12378520," I mean, I think that it wears on a lot of YouTubers."
12378520,12382960," I think that pressure can manifest in a lot of ways."
12382960,12389440," You see ones that are neurotic about maintaining their privacy."
12389440,12399560," I know of one that either did or does keep their face private that literally would not"
12399560,12400960," leave their house."
12400960,12405640," I spoke to this person and they had not left their house more than maybe twice in the last"
12405640,12412920," six months because they had a highly recognizable voice and were so concerned about maintaining"
12412920,12419240," that secrecy that they became essentially a shut-in."
12419240,12426320," And then you've got people that put their entire lives online, themselves, their parents,"
12426320,12431920," their kids, their pregnancies, their births, their deaths, whatever else."
12431920,12436760," And they just kind of embrace it."
12436760,12444560," I think that both ways eventually burn you out and everything in between eventually burns"
12444560,12452880," you out and you have to learn to kind of find a balance between sticking up for yourself,"
12452880,12465280," letting things roll off your back, like being sad sometimes, getting mad, learning to kind"
12465280,12467280," of get over that."
12467280,12469600," Yeah, it's tough."
12469600,12470600," I don't know."
12470600,12473960," I mean, like to be clear, one of the things that I remind myself constantly is like I"
12473960,12475880," chose this."
12475880,12477920," I could turn it off tomorrow."
12477920,12485280," I mean, how famous would I be in a year if I didn't upload a single video for a year?"
12485280,12486280," Not very."
12486280,12488480," I'm not famous famous."
12488480,12490760," I'm internet famous, niche famous, right?"
12490760,12493880," I went through this and I was still on Wancho every week."
12493880,12494880," Yeah."
12494880,12502280," I would get recognized walking around like plummeted really fast when I wasn't just constantly"
12502280,12503280," in videos."
12503280,12504280," Yeah."
12504280,12505280," Yeah."
12505280,12511480," So like that's the thing is there's that constant reminder that for me that's like,"
12511480,12514200," yeah, I could end this."
12514200,12521200," And that's encouraging."
12521200,12524080," Alexander says, hey, excited about the Henley shirt and screwdriver."
12524080,12527080," Thanks for being transparent about your products and how the company works."
12527080,12529760," How do you guys come up with new products to work towards slash developed a sell and"
12529760,12530760," sell an old TT store?"
12530760,12537040," I mean, sometimes it's just like I was looking through pictures of like computer stuff in"
12537040,12545720," my gallery, like in my photo archive for an upcoming Linus or Linus's team reacts to Linus's"
12545720,12546720," old computers."
12546720,12550360," By the way, you should almost certainly be one of the reactors because you haven't seen"
12550360,12551880," most of the janky stuff I've done."
12551880,12552880," I'm super down."
12552880,12553880," Yeah."
12553880,12559320," So I came across an image of one of my daughters."
12559320,12562080," Oh, here, can I borrow that for a sec?"
12562080,12565280," Okay, you know how these pillows often have a strap?"
12565280,12570920," I came across an image of one of my daughters while people were playing VR in the background,"
12570920,12573200," wearing one of these like a VR headset."
12573200,12578120," And I was like, Oh my God, we should do a VR headset plushie."
12578120,12579720," So we're going to do that now."
12579720,12580720," That's funny."
12580720,12583120," So sometimes it's just like a flash of inspiration like that."
12583120,12585280," Sometimes it's my ongoing, yeah, right?"
12585280,12587200," No, tell me something."
12587200,12591760," Should it have plushie wands or no?"
12591760,12593760," I don't think so."
12593760,12595760," Oh, but it's kind of like that."
12595760,12599080," Yeah, what if I kind of what if you want to kind of pose it on a shelf?"
12599080,12600840," Would you have the plushie wands next to it?"
12600840,12602520," Yeah, actually, I think so."
12602520,12605280," When I said no, I was thinking about it more as a pillow."
12605280,12606280," Sure."
12606280,12607280," And I was like, I feel like there'll be a no."
12607280,12608280," No, it's not a pillow."
12608280,12609280," It's wearable."
12609280,12610280," Yeah."
12610280,12611280," Yeah."
12611280,12612760," It's like it's kind of like that I feel like because yeah, you'd hold the ones."
12612760,12613760," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
12613760,12614760," Yeah."
12614760,12618600," So anyway, and then sometimes I'm just like really frustrated by the existing solution"
12618600,12619960," and I want a better one."
12619960,12622120," Like I was so tired of the stupid snap on bit storage."
12622120,12625560," I was like, no, no, no, no, no, no."
12625560,12627280," No, there must be a better way."
12627280,12629000," That's ridiculous."
12629000,12631360," I want a new backpack."
12631360,12632760," I did want a new backpack."
12632760,12634880," I know, I know."
12634880,12636040," I wanted a new backpack."
12636040,12639920," That one actually was really championed by Bridget, though, because like I wanted a new"
12639920,12644760," backpack and I was like willing to pay for a new backpack, like the whole development"
12644760,12646400," of a new backpack."
12646400,12651100," But I didn't have the confidence that we could make it happen."
12651100,12654080," And she was like, look, let me try."
12654080,12657000," I'm like, okay, it's your funeral."
12657000,12658800," She was like super new at the time."
12658800,12661120," Like, yeah, okay, you can waste your time."
12661120,12665640," But like, I'd really rather you were working on these things that have like a clear, a"
12665640,12667680," clear path to a great ROI."
12667680,12672560," And then backpack has outperformed probably everything else she ever did combined, which"
12672560,12674480," is not I'm not saying that those other things were bad."
12674480,12675640," I'm just saying she was clear."
12675640,12676640," She made the right call."
12676640,12677640," Good."
12677640,12678640," Yeah."
12678640,12679640," Yeah."
12679640,12682680," Christian says, Luke, since he played Tarkov and Elder Scrolls, have you looked at darkens"
12682680,12683680," darker?"
12683680,12689600," Yeah, I haven't had enough time to jump into like the play tests and whatever else they've"
12689600,12691760," done recently."
12691760,12694720," But yeah, I mean, you kind of nailed it."
12694720,12700720," The internet sphere of knowledge about me figured out that that would probably make"
12700720,12706040," sense for me and has just sent a deluge of information about it at me, just various videos"
12706040,12709720," and Google News things and whatever else have all hit my feeds."
12709720,12711120," So I'm aware of it."
12711120,12715320," And I'm sure I'll try it out at some point, but I haven't tried it out yet."
12715320,12718080," Looks really interesting."
12718080,12723040," I suspect it's going to be one of those games that are just like perpetually in beta."
12723040,12728080," But I hope that it hits a stable release or a stable playable state at some point at"
12728080,12732160," the very least because I know right now it's like kind of sometimes available and sometimes"
12732160,12733160," not."
12733160,12734160," I don't know."
12734160,12738560," Gregory asks, hey, Linus, will the lab have an API with clear rules that will allow us"
12738560,12740520," to make our own Chrome plugins?"
12740520,12745720," I mean, it really depends on what you would expect your Chrome plugins to do."
12745720,12747920," No third party, whatever."
12747920,12748920," And I'm--"
12748920,12750240," It's a reference to earlier in the show."
12750240,12751240," Yeah."
12751240,12756680," I'm legitimately just not exactly sure what a third party plugin would do."
12756680,12761240," Like I mean, that shopping comparison one, yeah, it could be third party."
12761240,12762240," I don't know."
12762240,12763240," That's weird."
12763240,12772240," API access for like a data set is like a paid feature."
12772240,12777320," From my point of view, like if you are an individual user interacting with a website"
12777320,12782880," to learn about products or help you build a computer or whatever else, I'm of the mind"
12782880,12786600," that that should be basically free."
12786600,12788800," We can give you a big solid maybe."
12788800,12794040," Yeah, advertisements, maybe affiliates almost certainly, like there are ways we're"
12794040,12796720," going to monetize that kind of interaction."
12796720,12802000," But I don't want us to basically just go, oh, you who needs to build a computer once"
12802000,12805600," every five years, we expect you to pay a monthly subscription."
12805600,12812960," Like I just don't really-- that doesn't seem like a viable way of engaging with users."
12812960,12819240," Whereas if you are-- yeah, if you're building it like some kind of comparison engine tool"
12819240,12825200," that integrates into AMP, is it like-- I mean, I don't think anyone would even expect that"
12825200,12828400," kind of access to the database to be free."
12828400,12830120," So I don't know."
12830120,12832000," I don't know what this is going to look like."
12832000,12834000," Yeah, solid maybe."
12834000,12836000," Last one."
12836000,12838400," Oh, there's two."
12838400,12843400," Caleb asks, have you considered adding a gym for employees to use?"
12843400,12844640," We technically have one."
12844640,12846760," It doesn't have equipment in it."
12846760,12847760," That could change."
12847760,12850360," That'd be great."
12850360,12855960," Basically what I was kind of thinking is when the real badminton center opens, there would"
12855960,12859080," be no reason to have like a badminton court in the gym."
12859080,12862200," So I was kind of thinking of just like shoving some equipment in it."
12862200,12864360," I'm deeply concerned about liability though."
12864360,12866480," Liability is a big problem."
12866480,12869480," Because I have no way of supervising and knowing if people are using it properly and"
12869480,12875080," if someone like breaks their knee the wrong way or whatever else in it, there's no first"
12875080,12876080," date attendant."
12876080,12879720," There's no-- so it's possible it won't happen."
12879720,12885240," There have to be ways because there are 24-hour fitness centers where you just like badge into"
12885240,12888040," them and there's nobody working there at the time."
12888040,12889200," But I don't know what the way is."
12889200,12892160," The way might be that they're just rolling the dice."
12892160,12894160," Sometimes that actually is the answer."
12894160,12895160," It could be."
12895160,12898880," I hope it's not because this sounds amazing and I would personally love it and use it"
12898880,12901640," all the time."
12901640,12903720," I use it as it is every week."
12903720,12904720," Liability is terrifying."
12904720,12907160," But a lot of the stuff that I am doing--"
12907160,12908160," Yeah, not everyone could."
12908160,12909160," You'd need equipment."
12909160,12910160," I get it."
12910160,12911160," Yeah."
12911160,12915360," And you would need equipment that would be sketchy from a liability standpoint."
12915360,12918520," And even if I went with someone because it's like something I would want to do with a spotter"
12918520,12926800," or whatever, they're not going to be hired by your gym to be responsible for whatever."
12926800,12928400," So there's still liability."
12928400,12931160," It doesn't help the liability problems at all, actually."
12931160,12932160," Yeah."
12932160,12933160," You know what?"
12933160,12934160," I think I'm kind of talked out of it."
12934160,12935160," No."
12935160,12937160," No, it's not happening, sorry."
12937160,12940160," We'll make that a maybe."
12940160,12941600," So thanks for tuning in to the WAN Show."
12941600,12942600," We'll see you again next week."
12942600,12944600," Same bad time, same bad channel."
12944600,12945600," Bye."
12945600,12950600," I'm running for the bathroom."
12950600,12952600," Yeah."
12952600,12959600," How long was this show?"
12959600,12960600," Four hours."
12960600,12961600," Four hours."
12961600,12962600," Four hours."
12962600,12963600," We're at--okay."
12963600,12964600," All right."
12964600,12965600," Three hours, 52 minutes."
12965600,12966600," This show is brought to you by Thorium, Audible, and Bessie."
12966600,12967600," I'm sorry."
12967600,12968600," Thanks."
12968600,12969600," In the bathroom."
12969600,12970600," Four hours, 52 minutes."
12970600,12971600," Thorium, not Thorium."
12971600,12976600," Thorium, I'm sorry, Thorium."
12976600,12978600," I'll say our name again, Thorium."
12978600,12979600," 52 minutes, 15 seconds."
12979600,12980600," I'm going to kill it there."
12980600,12981600," Beautiful ring, genuinely."
