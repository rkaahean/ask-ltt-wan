0,8640," What is up guys? Welcome to the WAN show. We're remote again. Luke, we're remote again."
8640,14000," I'm so sorry. What is going on? We're going to do in person. We're going to do in person"
14000,20020," WAN show eventually, eventually, but we're keeping the streak alive. It's been the Linus"
20020,24960," and Luke hosting the WAN show for over two years running now. Haven't missed a Friday"
24960,29560," because the truth is we make fun of you guys for having nothing better to do on a Friday"
29560,35480," than watch WAN show, but like the reality is we don't have anything better to either."
35480,43600," We're all here. We're all here. We've got a lot of great topics for you guys today. At"
43600,48440," least half of them are about mistakes we've made. I want to talk a little bit about what"
48440,55400," went on with our RTX 4080 coverage. Also, there's been some complaints about service"
55400,60640," from the LTT store. We've got some updates for you guys there. The other bad news you"
60640,64760," guys might not care about. It might actually be funny to you if Alex's reaction is anything"
64760,70680," to go by, but Luke and I have officially gone arc. You know what they say. Once you go"
70680,81000," arc, you never go back to arc again. Do you want to do a headline topic too? I kind of"
81000,88920," took most of it. Yeah, I mean, that is legitimately most things. Pokemon Scarlet and Violet plagued"
88920,92480," by performance issues. It's actually crazy. I don't know if you've seen this, but it's"
92480,98720," wild and I have some I have some takes. Also, the Doom Eternal soundtrack allegations are"
98720,108360," crazy. Yeah, like, like really wild and Bethesda slash ID soft response to it is also wild."
108360,115360," Yeah, the whole thing is wild. I'll talk about that later. Yeah, let's roll that intro."
115360,137960," The show is brought to you by OVH Cloud, Vessy footwear and 45 drives. Why don't we jump"
137960,147440," right into our first topic of the day. The RTX 4080 launch. So the 4080 is one and a half"
147440,157000," times faster than the 3080 10 gig for a 71.42 price increase. So $700 to $1,200. Meanwhile,"
157000,165560," the 4090 is 1.6 to 1.7 times faster than the 3090, sometimes more for a 6.7 price increase"
165560,177560," $1,500 to $1,600. The issue with this is that the 4080 still sold out on day one, though"
177560,183880," we don't know how many Nvidia shipped. And I think that where there's a bit of a disconnect"
183880,189960," between us and the community on the coverage of this card is that a lot of people feel"
189960,198080," that we didn't go after Nvidia hard enough for the pricing of the RTX 4080. I think that's"
198080,204560," a valid criticism. I think that we could have made more noise about it. But having debriefed"
204560,209400," with the team after the fact, like, you know, obviously after we released the video, after"
209400,213400," we saw the comments from people, there's a few things that I want to definitely want"
213400,220920," to address. So first of all, the idea that we are paid Nvidia shills is just stupid."
220920,226600," That's like, that's that's all I can really say about it. Not only has Nvidia not sponsored"
226600,235160," us to do anything in ever since the controversy with hardware unboxed, they have not so much"
235160,241520," as said a word to me personally. If you think for a second that with the way that we call"
241520,246840," out Nvidia when they do something wrong that we are somehow in their back pocket, I have"
246840,252200," no idea what to tell you. I just I can't anymore. That's it. That's my final word on"
252200,258160," the subject that I don't know what to tell you. You're confused. Okay, you hurt yourself"
258160,267680," in your confusion. So that's not what happened. What happened was a couple of things. A,"
267680,274720," we did call out the pricing, but it was towards the end of the video. And that that's our bad"
274720,280280," because we should know better. We know that by the end of the video, even a really good,"
280280,285200," really engaging video, you know, lots of great comments, really good like dislike ratio,"
285200,290760," you know, every indicator we possibly have people are tweeting out, well, that video,"
290760,296840," even a really good video is lucky to have 60 to 70% of the viewers who started watching"
296840,303600," it still watching by the kind of the conclusionary statement. And part of it is that is just"
303600,309960," an attention span thing. And part of it is that Austin Austin Evans actually described"
309960,314600," it to me the best way that I think I've ever heard anyone describe it. He said, you want"
314600,319640," to make sure that no part of your video allows the viewer to smell blood in the water. And"
319640,325080," by blood in the water, he means that it's wrapping up that the video is essentially over"
325080,330960," and there's no more pertinent information to convey. And when you get that reaction,"
330960,335320," if I if I'm like, Oh, it's over now, I'll just leave. Yeah, like that totally makes"
335320,341720," sense to me. So if you were to say something like in conclusion, the performance is great,"
341720,347400," but the pricing is a real problem here. So many people are just going to bail. I write"
347400,352760," as soon as you say and in summary, in conclusion, with all of that out of the way, the bottom"
352760,356440," line is as soon as you say those words, we try to avoid them. Sometimes we do it anyway,"
356440,361960," though, because we really do have an important point to make that makes the most sense in the"
361960,366840," conclusion, because from our point of view, our role when we're evaluating a piece of technology"
366840,371480," is to evaluate it as a piece of technology. This video will go up today, but it will still be"
371480,378440," there a year to years, five years from now, when the RTX 4080 might be in, might be, you know,"
378440,384840," one of the cards and just like a bargain bin of used cards at a local computer store, right?"
384840,388360," Like we don't know what's coming down the line, especially with regards to pricing."
388360,393880," And it's one of the reasons that we don't talk about it as much. Somewhere that we made a bad"
393880,402120," call was we're just kind of fatigued on complaining, whining about pricing. The bottom line is that,"
402120,406040," don't don't do no, don't do no, this is an important point. The bottom line is that it doesn't make a"
406040,410600," difference. And I've seen a lot of people kind of pushing back on that from me,"
410600,415160," or pushing back on me about that. No, Linus, it does make a difference. You have to use your"
415160,422520," position to advocate for lower pricing. But the thing is, the guys I've been doing this a long"
422520,428520," time, it doesn't work. You can absolutely advocate for change. And we do, and we will."
428520,434520," An example of a time when there's an actual like, law with the product itself."
434520,437960," Yeah, one of the things that I can often be quite efficient. Yeah, one of the things someone brought"
437960,444760," up to me was that I absolutely complained about the team viewer issue. But the issue there was"
444760,449080," that they were violating CanSpam. They were actually breaking the law by contacting me."
449080,456840," That's a separate problem. I have leverage. Okay. And so some people pointed out the seemingly"
456840,463240," contradictory stance, where we reviewed the card as the performance it was. We did comment on the"
463240,469800," pricing. We said it sucked. But we reviewed it as it was. And then I was turning around making memes"
469800,473880," about overpriced 40 series cards. And they're like, well, that's contradictory. And I'm sitting"
473880,480360," here going, no, you got to look at what I said. What I said was, until gamers stop buying"
480360,488280," Nvidia cards at inflated prices, there is nothing I can do. And just like with many other GPU launches,"
488280,493640," there was lineups outside the door for people waiting to buy this insanely overpriced product."
493640,498760," And people bought it out and it sold out. Yep. And the counter argument to that, like,"
498760,502200," I'm trying to, I'm trying to play devil's advocate against myself here, right?"
502200,509480," Because I did read through a lot of your comments and like, I get it. This situation sucks. But the"
509480,515720," counter argument to that guys is that we spent the entirety of the pandemic silicon shortage"
515720,520760," complaining about pricing and people kept buying stuff anyway. So people would say, well,"
520760,524600," Linus, if you complained about the pricing, if you said it was bad, people might not buy it."
524600,530440," And like, I wish I had that kind of power. I clearly don't. Because we"
530440,534920," gaming industry would probably be in a significantly better space with a lot less loot boxes and"
534920,541160," pay to win mechanics and other various junk. The final, the final argument that people made was,"
541160,547880," well, what about the 40, 80, 12 gig? Okay. Media and consumers made a lot of noise about that."
547880,555080," And Nvidia did reverse course, to which I would say, guys, do you really think that was a W?"
555080,559800," What did they do? What did Nvidia actually do?"
559800,569000," Renamed it? Yeah. They renamed it. That's not a win. We didn't win."
570440,574520," It's a bit of a win. It's a super, it's a very small W."
574520,578840," That's not a win. It's like lower than a lowercase W. It's like, it's a fine print W."
578840,584040," That's not a win. That's like, that's like them putting it in our mouth instead of all over our face."
584040,589160," Like, nah, that's not a win."
594680,602680," Now, it is still possible. It is still possible that Nvidia will alter the pricing of the 40,"
602680,607640," 70, 12 gig or whatever the devil they're going to end up calling it. That's possible. But if that"
607640,615320," happens, that is not in response to people complaining about it. That is in response to AMD's"
615320,622520," competitive pricing. The only thing, the only thing that matters is are the cards sitting on"
622520,626600," shelves. Actually, I lied. There was one more argument people made. They were saying that I"
626600,630760," was defending the higher pricing because Nvidia has a lot of 30 series that they need to move."
630760,636760," No, no, no, you're halfway there. You're halfway there. The higher pricing is because Nvidia has a"
636760,643560," lot of 30 series they need to move, at least allegedly. But that, that, that, I'm not, that,"
643560,649960," that has nothing to do with me. Nvidia is beholden to their shareholders. They need to drive as much"
649960,655240," profit as possible in order to appease their shareholders. They want their stock to go from"
655240,660280," doing this, which is what it's been doing lately, to doing this. And the way to do that is to make"
660280,666440," more profit. Yeah, they don't make more profit by making me happy, by making me not complain."
666440,669000," That's just not how it works. And I'm sorry. I wish it was."
669000,674120," I do think all these arguments are legit. I've had a big frustration for quite a while now."
674120,679720," For sure. It was buying stuff that it's like where everyone knows the whole vote with your wallet"
679720,684760," thing. But instead of buying, instead of not buying things that they shouldn't, people are like voting"
684760,688840," with their wallet in the wrong way. It's like they walked into the wrong booth or something. I don't"
688840,693400," know. I don't get it. Everyone's like super mad about microtransactions and pay to win stuff."
693400,697720," But then people buy it to insane degrees. Like Diablo and Mortal, people were spending"
697720,702760," people were spending like as much money as they could in the game to be like,"
702760,706760," when does it break the game? It's like, just, just don't."
707320,712920," Exactly. Don't spend excessive money in the game. But we still should have brought it up a little"
712920,717400," bit earlier and a little bit harder. Okay, Photon Pixie, Photon Pixie and Flow Plane Chat."
717400,721960," I want to hear your argument for this. You say the naming was a huge part of the problem. So"
721960,727720," them changing the name is important. Why? How does that matter?"
727720,735320," No, I do agree because it was misleading misleading in what way? FPS per dollar is all that matters."
737160,740840," We're not getting any more FPS per dollar if they just call it something else."
740840,747800," Yeah, but if you expect same performance but different RAM capacity, memory capacity,"
747800,751720," that isn't what you're getting. And based on the naming scheme, that's what it."
751720,755960," That aspect of changing the name, absolutely. And that is something that we would have called"
755960,760440," out. And that's why it's a little W. It's still a W. I mean, that's not a W. That's a thing that"
760440,766600," should have never happened. So, okay, so I want to clarify. When I said, when I was talking like,"
766600,771560," whether it's when I was saying whether it's a W or not, I meant in terms of what we are,"
771560,777640," what we're talking about, which is price to performance. So you're right, from a different"
777640,782440," point of view, from a consumer confusion point of view, absolutely that card should have been"
782440,788600," renamed. But we said that. We did say that. We never took up a contrary position. And that card,"
788600,794360," the 40, 80, 12 gig, never was released. So we never got a chance to review it and say,"
794360,800600," wow, this is awful and misleading. So all we have now is we have the 40, 80, 16 gig,"
800600,810120," which we said, okay, here's what it is. It's not a great value. And then we've got this 40,"
810120,815000," 80, 12 gig, 40, 70 card that is exactly the same value that it was before. It just has a different"
815000,821720," name. Now there was some, there was some, I think very valid criticism of our 40, 80 coverage."
821720,829320," And that's that perhaps we emphasized too much the performance of NVIDIA's top tier last generation"
829320,838680," cards, which are also not a great value. And that's very fair. That's totally fair. But let me at"
838680,845720," least provide a an alternate perspective on that. The customer for a 40, 90, the customer for a 40,"
845720,857480," 80, 12 gig at $1,200, okay, is not the same customer for a 30, 60 TI. So while you are absolutely"
857480,862760," going to care, you know, what card provides the best bang for the buck, that customer for that"
862760,869880," card doesn't care about it as much as you might probably think. That is one thing to consider. So"
869880,874840," when you're reviewing a product, you're not reviewing it in a vacuum, you're reviewing it in the context"
874840,882520," of what it's actually competing against. And a 40, 80, 12, or 16 gig at $1,200 is not competing"
882520,890600," against a card that was 400 bucks in the last generation. Another criticism was that we're not"
890600,897560," talking about AMD enough. Okay, we're going to get a chance. And I think that was an oversight on our"
897560,903240," part. We could have talked about AMD more. And that's going to happen. I'm personally super"
903240,911320," excited for the launch of the 7000, well, okay, this 7000 series from AMD, not the HD 7000,"
911320,916840," the RX 7000 series, I'm very excited. They're going to have to release their stuff for you to"
916840,924040," be able to talk about it more. Yes. Oh, I don't know. But yeah, could have could have"
924040,928440," been said a little bit earlier, could have been said a little bit stronger, but yeah, I think all"
928440,935560," the other points still stand. So the bottom line here is, hey, don't two note, the bottom line here"
935560,940920," is, you know what? I'm sorry, you know, we want to make sure that we're covering products in the way"
940920,946680," that you guys want to see. But I hope you understand why we did things the way that they did. And I"
946680,953320," hope you also understand how it's not constructive to, you know, launch into a conspiracy theory about"
953320,960280," how Nvidia paid us to cover the card in a particular way, because that's not helpful, right? It doesn't"
960280,966040," serve any positive purpose to just make assumptions that have no basis in reality and start talking"
966040,969400," about that instead of trying to figure out what was actually going on. Because if we want to"
969400,973480," understand each other, then we all got to be kind of speaking the same language. So if you guys are"
973480,978120," saying, look, here's why I'm upset, then I can go, okay, I can fix that. Whereas if you say,"
978120,981720," Linus, you need to stop taking money from Nvidia to give them a positive review. I'm kind of going,"
981720,986040," well, I can't fix that because it didn't happen in the first place. So we're not even able to get"
986040,990280," aligned here, right? It's like walking into a car dealership and saying, I'll give you $10."
990280,995000," And they're just going to, they're not even going to engage in conversation. You know, I have a real"
995000,1003000," discussion at that point, right? You know, it's something that I feel like we haven't talked about"
1003000,1013160," enough. Luke? What? The fact that AMD's cards being priced at $900 to $1,000 is like not great either."
1013160,1019240," Oh, yeah. No, I think we talked about that on Whanshow when the when the pricing got leaked"
1019240,1026200," about how like, this is going to be seen as a win. But just like we've always said, just being an"
1026200,1032440," underdog doesn't mean you're a good guy. And like AMD is 100% taking advantage of"
1033240,1039640," the pricing hellscape that Nvidia has set up to also increase theirs and move their top end"
1039640,1047080," pricing and everything else along with it up quite a bit. 900 bucks on the top end is a lot."
1047080,1053960," It's a ton of money. And I hope AMD can compete there because I want there to be competition even"
1053960,1060520," regardless of the pricing increases. And it looks like AMD's new, just to go with the Nintendo"
1060520,1067560," naming is put new and like with like RGB lines all around it. AMD's new 7000 series will do well."
1067560,1073960," But it still doesn't mean that it's not priced really highly. His performance really good."
1073960,1080200," He radically, hopefully, sure. I mean, we're optimistic. Yeah. The yikes. We"
1080200,1088440," against against my better judgment, you know, we gave AMD every possible benefit of the doubt"
1089000,1094120," after the RX 7000 series announcement stream. Like this is this is interesting. I just don't"
1094120,1099240," know what to do, right? Holgar 69 in Twitch chat goes, you do not sound enthusiastic about our DNA"
1099240,1103080," three like actual gamers are you are purposely avoiding and acting like it isn't coming."
1103080,1113480," Did you watch the video? We took what AMD said at face value. We dug into their seemingly"
1113480,1119720," intentionally vague data, extracted as much useful information as we could, took it completely at"
1119720,1126760," face value and then compared it against Nvidia's best. And we were jacked about it. What can I"
1126760,1134680," possibly do other than that? How can you possibly come to that conclusion? I don't know what to do."
1134680,1137960," That's just a fanboy problem. There's nothing you can do about that."
1138520,1143800," I don't know, man. I am excited. Limited there. I'm always excited for competition,"
1143800,1149560," which doesn't mean that every new entrant is necessarily going to be a valid option."
1149560,1157480," Why don't we get into our next topic here? Luke and I have officially, officially started the 30"
1157480,1165320," day Intel arc challenge. That's right. It's happening. Started late last night. I currently"
1165320,1174920," have two power supplies under my desk. You know what's the funny thing about it is five years ago,"
1174920,1179480," that wouldn't have even been a problem. But Luke and I both ran into physical installation issues"
1179480,1185560," with our cards because I couldn't find the modular cable bags for my power supplies for the two"
1185560,1194600," machines that I moved to Intel arc and the a 750 and a 770 both use an eight and six pin power adapter."
1194600,1201960," And both of us in all the rigs we upgraded were using dual eight pin and not six plus two,"
1201960,1209160," like dual eight pin connectors. And I was not going to go out and get a Dremel and freaking cut off"
1209160,1218360," two pins for a temporary ass GPU install. That was not going to happen. So, thankfully, I actually"
1218360,1224360," always carry an ATX deepening tool with me. It is literally always in my backpack. So I was like,"
1224360,1232840," I have the solution. My emergency tech drawer had a dual molex to six pin PCIE adapter. So I"
1232840,1239080," deepened that took the sacrificial connector, deepened my power supply, put all the pins in,"
1239080,1243560," and I'm ready to go. I just got the extra two just hanging out in their eight pin for when I"
1243560,1248200," put it back together and hopefully don't destroy it. And then Luke, I strongly, I love Luke's"
1248200,1253160," solution, the Dremel option. I very strongly considered it. I was literally staring at my"
1253160,1258200," cable and being like, I could do this. This would be fine. But then I was like, no, because it's"
1258200,1263320," going to permanently scar it. I don't have the other cables for this. So yeah, I went down to the"
1263320,1270200," garage, found this like ancient but awesome power supply. And tech signature. Yeah, definitely"
1270200,1277160," stolen from work. Oh, yeah. Like 100% actually, though. A long time ago. That's probably one of my"
1277160,1283080," like oldest stolen from work things that I have. Dusted it off because that was actually a problem."
1284600,1289240," Because it's been sitting in a garage for many years. But yeah, jumpred the 24 pin, put it in the"
1289240,1294760," four, put it in the five. And now I have to turn my computer on like a plane, because I have to turn"
1294760,1299960," the power supply on for the graphics card. It's going. And then I have to turn the computer on,"
1299960,1306200," but I have like a starter motor and then I actually turn the computer on, which I find genuinely"
1306200,1309800," entertaining. So I think I'm just going to leave it this way for like the whole month. Oh, no."
1310600,1315400," You're going to kick it. You're going to kick it at some point. 100%."
1315400,1322600," I have it. So the 24 pin with the bridging connector is just resting in the arc box right now."
1322600,1330840," But I'm going to like tape it in there. And then like manage the power supply back there. But I"
1330840,1335800," think I'm actually going to leave it because at some point, when we did the last upgrade to the"
1335800,1342520," system, the extra cables went missing in some part of that process. But I don't have a six pin for it."
1342520,1346600," I could go find it's just a sea sonic power. Yeah, and it's cable. I could like I could find."
1346600,1353720," Yeah, they'd send you one. I won. Sure. Yeah. Do I need them to send me a single cable so I can"
1353720,1357960," run it for like other time it gets here like two weeks? Like, I don't know, probably not."
1357960,1364840," So yeah, as long as I can make it manageable, so my girlfriend won't kill me. I'll probably just"
1365400,1370120," just leave it as this. We could picture that. Oh, it'll it'll be in the video. You'll see."
1370120,1375880," Oh, it'll be in the video. There's going to be a lot of stuff in the video. I am not going to lie."
1375880,1382440," It was one disappointment after another for me. Like, I, I will accept. I will accept my portion"
1382440,1388200," of the blame here. Okay. Oh, man. I should have had my modular cables. All right."
1388200,1392600," Yeah, I should have those installation problems are honestly not on our. Yeah, those are"
1392600,1397800," that is entirely on us. Those are not on Intel. I should have checked the product page to see if"
1397800,1410680," they made any mention of VR before I put one in my VR gaming PC. They don't rough. Yeah. Those of"
1410680,1415560," you who watched the WAN show where we came up with the idea of the Intel arc challenge will"
1415560,1421880," remember that I got called out. Okay. During the Linux challenge, I only switched my daily driver"
1421880,1429080," gaming PC over to Linux. I left the VR gaming rig that I have in my living room on Windows because"
1429080,1436040," VR on Linux is pretty much not a thing. And I use my VR rig for exercise. Like I'll play Beat Saber"
1436040,1444040," for cardio and don't laugh. It is good. It's actually really good exercise. And so this time around,"
1444040,1449480," I got specifically called out by many members of our community. And I think Luke as well for"
1449480,1453960," doing that last time. And they basically said, look, it's not the arc challenge unless you go"
1453960,1460120," arc all the way. So the the living room PC and your gaming rig, they have to be arc. Can I go?"
1460120,1467400," Sure. So after fighting with BIOS updates, getting resizable, bar enabled, switching my boot partition"
1467400,1473960," from MBR to GPT so that I could UEFI boot. And finally, finally loading up steam VR."
1475000,1480760," Well, I don't want to spoil anything. But let's just say I sent a little DM over to one of my"
1480760,1487560," contacts at Intel and I went, if you guys want part two of this video to include,"
1487560,1494600," but hey, don't worry, they fixed it. You got 30 days to fix it."
1494600,1500360," Such a spooky message. I got to reach out from someone on that team being like, is there anything"
1500360,1510280," else? Did you really? I'm not going to say who they're a good person though. But yeah, it's"
1510280,1517400," so I think I actually might have a solution for your VR thing. Really? Yeah. So because the"
1517400,1524440," problem with the Linux challenge was that you sort of in a way use your VR rig as a way to,"
1524440,1528600," you know, not engage with the Linux system pretty much at all until the last week."
1529960,1532520," I just didn't feel like gaming. It was such a chore."
1532520,1539080," Except it was VR. That's why I was playing B-Saber. Yeah, because like, yeah, just grab and go."
1539080,1545960," How about? Sure. We don't, I don't think completely cut it. So cutting you off of VR for the month"
1545960,1553400," is honestly part of the art challenge. But okay, thanks. But it seems a little unreasonable."
1553400,1558120," So I think not being able to do it for like a week or two. So you can feel the pain a little"
1558120,1563240," bit because that's part of it. Okay. Then after that, I think you should be able to switch back."
1563240,1570920," But the amount of time that you spend playing VR has to be mirrored with playing games on your"
1570920,1575560," art system. Okay. You know what? You spend an hour playing B-Saber. You have to spend an hour on"
1575560,1583640," your art system. No, I'm going full in. I'm going full in. I want Intel to fix arc. So that's it."
1584440,1592200," I will not use VR during this 30 days unless Intel fixes it. It's just, man, I'm frustrated."
1592200,1599800," Yeah. And then Lou, okay. So right as a follow up, Lou, can I both did our installs yesterday?"
1599800,1603720," And the stream, I think the stream archive is actually, if it's not up on Flowplane,"
1603720,1610040," then we'll get that fixed. We'll get it published on Flowplane. But Lou, can I actually streamed for"
1610840,1616600," about an hour and a half trying to play games. And we played, I think, five or six games."
1616600,1622040," And we had not going to lie. We had some challenges with all of them. Day one did not go well."
1622040,1626840," And I don't know how hopeful I am for how much it's going to improve over the next 30 days."
1626840,1633880," You guys are going to want to watch the videos though because it's there's a lot more detail."
1633880,1638440," I'm actually pretty hopeful. I think it's going to improve. I'm saying that seriously."
1638440,1643720," There's only one direction it can go, Lou. That's part of the reason why."
1643720,1650440," I know. But no, because a lot of what we were doing had to do is streaming, right?"
1650440,1655400," We were trying to do remote play together. Yes. You were trying to stream off of the card."
1655400,1660600," Yes. But like when I was playing working on a review of the Logitech G Cloud,"
1660600,1665720," so video encoding is actually as important as gaming performance for me right now."
1666840,1673640," Yep. Yep. So encoding was a problem. It was a big problem, consistent big problem."
1673640,1679080," But like when I was streaming off of my CPU and we were playing Halo, it was fine."
1679080,1688920," When you were not encoding untitled Goose games and we were playing with your arc and we were"
1688920,1695240," playing remote play, it was fine. So for like super normy, level of gaming, no VR,"
1695240,1700840," no encoding, etc, etc. I think it's going to be fine. And I think that's probably going to be a"
1700840,1706040," pretty significant amount of the month. So I think the hill is up from here."
1706040,1712920," Yeah. It's an uphill battle. That's for sure. Not sure if that's what you meant there, but I like it."
1716040,1720600," We've got a comment in float plane. I actually missed who it was, but basically asked what the"
1720600,1724600," LTT store deals of the week are. Guys, if you want to leave a merch message, remember,"
1724600,1728840," don't leave super chats or Twitch bits or highlighted chats or whatever else. It's all about the"
1728840,1734360," merch messages over on LTT store. You can in the checkout, see a little box that says merch messages,"
1734360,1739240," you can fill that out. Luke, there's a stipulation. If you use like, what is it? Auto complete."
1739240,1743000," Shop pay. If you use shop pay, it won't show up. So you got to watch out for that. That's"
1743000,1746760," that's not our fault. There's nothing we can do about that. But anything other than shop pay will"
1746760,1752360," work. However, we don't really have any deals to call out this week because this is sort of"
1752360,1758040," related to our next topic. You guys probably noticed we've had some challenges with respect to"
1758040,1764120," customer support response times again. We've gotten a huge influx of tickets as screwdriver"
1764120,1769720," shipments have started going out. And it's a combination of things. One is that the more orders"
1769720,1775160," you are generating. And we're coming into the holiday season. So there's a lot of orders coming in."
1775160,1779400," The more customer support tickets you get, and it's just it's just a numbers game. It's not"
1779400,1785800," necessarily because you're doing anything wrong. It just happens. Oh, I'm moving or I'm unexpectedly"
1785800,1789960," not going to be home. Can you delay my shipment or ship it here instead? Just little things like"
1789960,1795800," that, right? The other thing is the more shipments you're shipping out, the more customer support"
1795800,1802040," tickets you are going to get. You know, oh, hey, it's got held by customs. Can you help me just"
1802040,1807640," just all those kinds of things? It's nobody's fault. It just happens. And the third thing is that"
1807640,1815320," sometimes you when you have a really enthusiastic community that is posting on Reddit and posting"
1815320,1822280," on the forum when their stuff arrives, like, I got my black shaft screwdriver. That generates a lot"
1822280,1827720," of, hey, someone else got it. Where's mine? So we are getting a lot of tickets right now."
1827720,1833480," We've also done a few things wrong, and I want to acknowledge that. So in order to optimize our"
1833480,1840760," sorting and shipping, the team has apparently been pre-printing labels too far out ahead."
1840760,1844760," So they're thinking that they could get things shipped quite quickly. They've been pre-printing"
1844760,1849880," some labels that have sat for, in some cases, a few days, like three or four days or even up to"
1849880,1854440," a week. And when someone gets a notification that the label is created, their assumption is it's"
1854440,1859880," moving. And that hasn't always been the case. So we've asked them to not, even if it does cost them"
1859880,1865080," some, I mean, right, it's a balancing act, right? On the one hand, you want to optimize"
1865080,1870600," your output. You want to ship as many things as possible, because that's ultimately the best way"
1870600,1875080," to not have people yelling at you. But on the other hand, you don't want to create the wrong"
1875080,1881160," expectations from people where they think something shipped and it's not. So that's right. You're"
1881160,1884280," just going to have to find the right balancing point. The other issue is that-- I'm going to do"
1884280,1890680," that, but I'll deal with it offline. The other issue is it's mid-November. So shipping volumes"
1890680,1895800," are going way up. The shipping industry has been notoriously understaffed this year already as it"
1895800,1902760," was. And so our partners, so we use Whizmo, which is a consolidation service that allows us to make"
1902760,1907240," our shipping rates as competitive as they are. There have been some delays in breaking down"
1907240,1911400," pallets. And to be clear, I'm not blaming them. It just is what happens when volumes go up."
1911400,1918040," And then that combined with just generally shipping volumes being really high, I think has"
1918040,1923800," created a perfect storm of longer responses. So my answer to your question, do we have any"
1923800,1929080," deals on the store this week is no. We do not have any deals on the store because what we want to do"
1929080,1934040," is give our freshly beefed up customer support team, which now has twice as many members."
1934040,1939160," And we're hiring another 50% more. So by the time we're done, we'll have triple the customer"
1939160,1943880," support team. Want to give them a little bit of time to catch up. We want to give the shipping team"
1943880,1947800," a little bit of time to catch up. Let's get all of those labels that they've already printed going"
1947800,1951800," out the door. And if you guys want to send in a merch message, what I'm going to recommend is"
1951800,1956760," go ahead and pick up a gift card or something like that. So you can get a merch message on a gift card"
1956760,1962760," and who knows with Black Friday coming up, maybe you'll have an opportunity to use it."
1962760,1969320," On something that's on sale. Yeah. One thing that won't be on sale is the"
1969320,1972360," retro polar fleece that we just launched today. Did you see this thing?"
1972360,1978600," Looks awesome. Yeah. I'm I'm totally down. It's a delightfully 90s. It's a little too warm in here"
1978600,1984120," for me to wear it. But like, yeah, how fun is that design? I absolutely love it."
1985000,1990520," At the Brandon picture. I'm going to have to find a brand. I have seen him with his"
1990520,1997000," tiny baby. But this picture was the thing that convinced me most that he's a dad."
1997000,2005320," I know, right? Got the coffee cup. Like, wow. Yeah, these pictures are great. It looks comfy. It"
2005320,2013560," looks classic. Makes sense. Going for a very 90s inspired, 90s inspired look. I'm I'm super"
2013560,2019560," happy with how this one turned out. Yeah. All right. Yeah."
2019560,2030200," Yes, it screams 90s. Thank you, chat 100%. All right. So that's it for all the things that I"
2030200,2034040," have to talk about about like bad news. Why don't we talk about some good news?"
2034040,2040920," Oh, is there any good news in here this week? Oh, crap. There's no good news."
2041880,2047480," Um, um, yeah, it's all bad news. All right. Luke, want to pick some bad news?"
2047480,2054440," Twitter stuff is good news. It's good news. Okay. I will. I'll allow it. Defend yourself."
2054440,2059880," Defend your stance here. I think entertainment's good. What do you mean?"
2059880,2067720," It's been so fun. You can't say it hasn't been fun. No one can say it hasn't been fun."
2067720,2072840," It's been so entertaining. I think some of Twitter's staff could probably argue that this hasn't been"
2072840,2077800," fun. Okay. Okay. That's probably fair. That's probably fair. I think they're going to be fine."
2077800,2085480," I've taken this case before. I know it's a lot. A lot of companies are fine right now. I also"
2085480,2090520," know that a lot of companies are hiring right now. And I know that scouting is still active. Um,"
2090520,2096360," so I know this doesn't solve the problem losing your job freaking sucks, even if lots of people"
2096360,2104040," are offing you one. Um, but I do hope that people don't get too discouraged by it and don't lose"
2104040,2109000," hope. And honestly, it doesn't look like they really are. Um, I don't think they seem to mind too"
2109000,2115080," much. They seem to be meaning right back to the meme king of Twitter. Yeah. Yeah. This is a,"
2115080,2120040," this is a strong, a lot of them are resigning for than anything. Yeah. Taking that,"
2120040,2125320," ever instance, if I'm a quick, it's three months or something. Pretty good. Um, I'm, I'm rather"
2125320,2129400," certain that skilled developers and other staff at Twitter are going to be able to land"
2129400,2137080," fantastic jobs. I mean, nobody's hiring, but then again, periods like tend to be periods of"
2137080,2141800," startup explosion. Because all of a sudden startups can afford"
2141800,2147000," talent again for a change. Like people that worked at this company that know the people that"
2147000,2151320," they liked working at and it were good at their jobs, whatever it was, they're going to go start"
2151320,2156040," stuff up. People, people are going to start stuff up and they've got some, they've got some"
2156040,2162840," severance to do it with. Yeah. Yeah. Doesn't hurt a lot of people at Twitter had really"
2162840,2168680," fantastic, uh, total compensation packages, um, and are probably doing pretty well. You might"
2168680,2173960," want to move out of the Bay area to make that money go a little bit further. Um, but like, yeah,"
2173960,2180280," I think people are pretty well set up to have some time to find somewhere new to work or to"
2180280,2185480," start something up with some friends, uh, or, or do whatever they need. Also the no one's"
2185480,2192120," hiring thing is not, is not true. Um, I mean, we're hiring. We're hiring other places are hiring."
2192120,2198840," There's the, the, the, Twitter of the world are not hiring right now. Holy s***."
2198840,2204520," Total top might go down. What? Have you seen how many positions we're hiring? I was like"
2204520,2210840," memeing a little bit, but we are hiring. We're hiring. Okay. We'll have to talk about that in"
2210840,2216680," a minute. Sorry, Luke. Go on. Um, but yeah, the like, your, your total comp might go down."
2216680,2220200," You're going to be okay. Um, and you might be able to work on something less soul sucking."
2220200,2228040," So maybe that'll be good. Um, or if you're, if you're just totally your total comp isn't going"
2228040,2231640," to go down and you'll just go somewhere and be awesome anyways, I don't know, but I think people"
2231640,2238680," are going to be okay. Um, and I am, I am enjoying the, the entertainment often served up by now"
2238680,2246360," ex Twitter employees because man, they have been spicy. Yeah. Ready to go to town. Um,"
2246360,2251400," it's been, it's been really entertaining. I am not surprised every, every time that Elon"
2251400,2255560," tweets out like, the whole act of users is higher than ever. I'm like, yeah, that's makes sense"
2255560,2258600," because I've honestly like never been on Twitter more than I am right now. Yeah."
2258600,2262760," Because watching the world burn is just so great. It's nice and warm. It's cozy. You"
2262760,2267160," got some popcorn. Have a good time. Um, so do you want to walk us kind of through it this week in"
2267160,2271640," Twitter? Oh wait, I think, I think, I think Twit is already taken. There's, there's a different"
2271640,2274440," tech show that calls themselves that. Okay. We're going to have to go with something else."
2274440,2279160," Uh, this last seven days in Twitter TLS, D I T."
2280200,2288200," I think doing a summary of this that isn't like half a day long is going to be, uh, ineffective."
2288200,2292120," We'll do what we can. Okay. But yeah, it's, it's been wild. Start with Sunday."
2292120,2297720," We blew. Yeah. Okay. Sunday Twitter employees, uh, corrects, Elon on Twitter. Which one was"
2297720,2301560," this because there was multiple. This was Eric Froen, Froenhofer."
2301560,2309000," Okay. Yeah. Forgive my pronunciation. This was the most talked about one as far as I know."
2309000,2315560," Yeah. Um, he was, he was corrected by this guy. Uh, and then someone's like, oh, this person should"
2315560,2323400," be fired. And then Elon responded with, they have been like, oh, that tweet is gone. Oh, shut up."
2323400,2333320," I wonder if it was, you know, maybe legal exposure to tweet to fire people for tweeting. Like, oh man,"
2333320,2337800," be surprised. Do you know how there's got to be something from a problem with that?"
2337800,2347720," I mean, I can, I can talk for ages about the, the challenges around dismissing employees. It is"
2347720,2354120," not as simple as like, especially if you're not in an, in an at will location. So I don't know if,"
2354120,2359000," our non American friends might not be familiar with the term at will at will employment means"
2359000,2365640," that an employer can just terminate you from your job. No notice, nothing. But that doesn't exist in"
2365640,2369960," most of the world as far as I can tell. Actually, I shouldn't say most of the world because by"
2369960,2375400," population, most of the world probably is an at will at will employment place. But certainly not"
2375400,2381080," most of the of the Western world. So like in Canada, for example, you can't just fire someone. You"
2381080,2386120," have to follow procedures. You have to, uh, you have to pay severance. You have to make sure that"
2386120,2392840," all the loose ends are tied up. Um, and if they believe that they have been wrongfully dismissed,"
2392840,2399480," like, for example, due to discrimination, then they can absolutely turn around and litigate, right?"
2399480,2406280," And if there is anywhere that wrongful termination suits are going to happen,"
2406280,2414120," it is in the good old U S of California. Okay. Or the United California, America, whatever"
2414120,2417800," California's country is going to be called when it eventually seeds."
2417800,2423560," One of my favorite things to point out now that you said that California has more people than all"
2423560,2429320," of Canada. Boom. Let's keep going. Yeah, I know. Right. When I found that, I was like, whoa."
2429320,2438440," I know, I know. So that's that's hilarious. Like the amount of legal jeopardy that Elon seems to"
2438440,2443880," be putting himself in throughout this entire process. Just I was just going to say, yeah,"
2443880,2449240," I've had just with firing employees. No, I know. Literally everywhere in the world. I know."
2449240,2454680," And I've had multiple people tell me, no, no, this is a four D chess game. It's 40 chess. He's"
2454680,2460600," tanking it for some reason. There's like, there's a reason. And I'm sitting here going, I don't know."
2460600,2467560," I don't know. I don't think it was 40 chess. I think, I think the reason why he, uh, committed"
2467560,2475000," to buying it was like ego issues. I don't think that was 40 chess. Um, man, hmm."
2475000,2484040," Puh, I do think he has a plan. Um, I'm not necessarily saying it's, it's like a good one or it's going"
2484040,2489480," to work or anything like that. But I think, I think people going with the angle of like, he knows"
2489480,2494360," absolutely nothing. He's just a complete idiot. Um, and he has no plan. I don't think that's"
2494360,2501720," accurate. I think he has a plan. Apparently California is at will. Whoa. I did not know that."
2501720,2507960," How do these things work then? So I guess it's at will, but you can still, because absolutely,"
2507960,2512520," we also don't even suits. So also, we don't even necessarily know where this person was from."
2512520,2516360," There's Twitter employees all over the world. That's true. Okay. Last"
2516360,2524120," win show. Was it last win show? Might have been so. I was in Serbia. Um, when I got on that plane"
2524120,2529960," after I hung up, there was a Twitter employee getting on the plane. Oh, not going back to work."
2529960,2534360," I don't think I would tell you about this. They were wearing a Twitter official backpack. And I was"
2534360,2539720," like, whoa, and they're like, yeah, don't know if I'm going to have a job soon. So going home."
2541480,2545560," Oh, man, I have a long conversation, but I thought it was pretty interesting. Um,"
2545560,2551000," but yeah, there's there's there's problems because there's people all over the world. Like there's"
2551000,2557000," there's huge termination issues with remember, correctly, it was Ireland. Um,"
2557000,2560440," I've terminated a bunch of people there was like totally not okay. I don't I don't remember."
2560440,2566680," This is not in our notes, but okay, California is at will, but there are retaliation protections,"
2566680,2572680," layoff notifications, discrimination protections, etc that need to be followed. So I guess I"
2572680,2579240," misunderstood at will. I understood. Yeah, I understood at will to mean basically that you have no"
2579240,2585880," protection whatsoever. Um, you you definitely, it sounds like have at least some protection. You"
2585880,2592440," can't just be terminated for like having a particular color of skin then or whatever the case may be."
2593080,2598600," Um, all right. Yeah, there's technically at will, but there's always exceptions. People are"
2598600,2603240," clarifying. I mean, that's the thing about America. It's so because it's as far as I can tell,"
2603240,2608840," basically like over 50 little tiny countries all with their own special rules, but like"
2608840,2613640," then they're there like combined somehow and it's not quite clear exactly how like"
2613640,2619560," let me tell you guys tax compliance in the US as a foreign entity is a nightmare as far as I can"
2619560,2624120," tell. The way that other companies are doing it is they just aren't doing it. Like at our scale,"
2624120,2629240," they just aren't bothering. That that's including American companies. You said as a foreign company,"
2629240,2635880," it's still a nightmare for local American companies. And a lot of them just don't do it until"
2635880,2639480," states or counties or whatever get mad at them about it. And then they"
2643480,2648520," given the birds a talk into it. Okay. Getting to to into it. They enjoy the conversation."
2648520,2655320," Uh, but okay. We're still on Sunday. Yeah, Sunday. We're still on Sunday Monday and Tuesday."
2655320,2660280," More Twitter shenanigans. They delay blue until the end of the month. Yeah, the whole thing just"
2660280,2664840," goes away. You can't do it anymore. The whole conversation from the previous week,"
2664840,2668200," just gone completely. Does someone have a live?"
2668200,2673800," Figured out. Does someone have a live stream of a head of lettuce that they started the day that"
2673800,2678120," Elon took over Twitter? Like is that is that happening? Yeah, I'm going to find it. I'm going to"
2678120,2682920," find it with whoever the Prime Minister of the UK was. And then the lettuce one, which was pretty"
2682920,2689240," epic. But yeah, so blues gone. The whole thing everyone was talking about is over. I suspect"
2689240,2692920," that's probably because, oh, you know, they cost multiple companies billions of dollars."
2693880,2699880," The minor issue. Uh, there's there's a bunch of Slack channel problems. Apparently a bunch of"
2699880,2704840," the engineers that came over from some of the yolans other companies are used to using Teams."
2704840,2710600," And I guess in Teams, newly created channels are private by default. This whole thing,"
2710600,2714760," someone was writing this and I was like, this is weird because it's very obvious when you're"
2714760,2720040," creating Slack channels, if they're public or not. Right. Um, yeah, apparently they use Teams."
2720040,2723480," They're private by default. So they created Slack channels and they were public."
2723480,2726520," And other people joined them and were able to see what they were talking about. And they were"
2726520,2729880," talking trash about like a bunch of employees talking about who they were going to fire and"
2729880,2734440," stuff like that. Oh, wow. That was apparently just like a huge nightmare. They privatized the"
2734440,2738360," channels afterwards. They did all this stuff. But like people had the transcripts of everything"
2738360,2743640," that was in there. It was like, yeah. And I only learned about the site blind recently."
2743640,2749080," I didn't have any reason to ever do you know, you don't know blind? Okay. It's actually a super"
2749080,2755080," cool concept. It's a social network. Uh, yeah, it's a social network that's for professionals."
2755080,2760600," It's kind of like LinkedIn, except they validate that you actually work wherever you say that you"
2760600,2766840," work. And only other people who work there can contact you and the whole thing's anonymous."
2766840,2772600," So it's an opportunity for people to compare salaries or talk about workplace discrimination"
2772600,2778600," or, um, you know, exchange information like what you're talking about. So screenshots like this"
2778600,2787320," are going to be spreading like absolute wildfire in blind completely behind the scenes inaccessible"
2787320,2794680," to anyone who doesn't actually work at Twitter. And they do, they do periodic validation. So they'll"
2794680,2798280," send an email to your work email. Hey, do you still actually work there? And then they'll cut you"
2798280,2803240," off of it if you don't actually work there. So, um, they discourage you from sharing any"
2803240,2807960," identifying information. It's a super cool concept. And so as far as I can tell,"
2807960,2815480," blind has been experiencing an absolute surge in popularity and, and just has this enormous"
2815480,2823640," profile, uh, compared to what it had before because of how public and how explosive this meltdown has"
2823640,2830200," been. Really funny that Twitter on blind is rated more highly currently than Amazon and Intel."
2832120,2837720," Well, there's still time for that. Yeah, I'm sure that's deteriorating. Um,"
2837720,2846200," sorry. Yeah, so Twitter blue goes down. Um, Elon tells managers to scrape, uh, slack channels for"
2846200,2854760," criticism. And then I have heard, um, that after that, people who criticized him were fired,"
2854760,2860680," one of the problems with a lot of this stuff. It's all hearsay. A lot of it, including this one,"
2860680,2865400," is there's hearsay all over the place. And what I have found with a ton of this,"
2865400,2870120," and I want to add, add allegedlys to before I started talking, add allegedlys to after and"
2870120,2874760," add them all the way through. Um, because what I have found many, many, many times with stories"
2874760,2880760," coming out of Twitter is that things are partially true. Things are only partially true. Yeah,"
2880760,2888600," like a lot of the remote work stuff. Um, a lot of the remote work stuff, it's that sort of happened."
2889160,2894360," He did call people back into work, but it wasn't quite exactly the way people were describing it."
2894360,2899400," It wasn't everyone, no matter what always blah, blah, blah. Uh, we especially heard this about,"
2899400,2904360," I think it was Dublin, uh, because people figured out that there like literally was not enough"
2904360,2908680," currently vacant housing in Dublin to fill the amount of people that he called in. Uh,"
2908680,2914440," and it was clarified, like that's not what happened. Um, it was like, if you have the ability to,"
2914440,2918520," you need to, uh, but if you don't have the ability to, then it's not expected. Like,"
2918520,2923640," that's totally different than you have to no matter what. So it's like, I don't know, things"
2923640,2927960," are still happening. They're very drastic, but they're not potentially, sometimes they are"
2927960,2932680," exactly as drastic as they seem, right? He publicly fired someone on Twitter. That happened."
2932680,2937720," We saw that happen. Yeah, we have facts for that, right? Uh, but not everything is quite that"
2937720,2943080," cut and dry. Um, but yeah, theoretically, allegedly, uh, he told managers to scrape slack"
2943080,2950280," channels for criticism and to fire those people. Um, Elon may actually manage to improve Twitter"
2950280,2956760," in one way, at least end to end encryption. Okay. I didn't actually know this. Um, end to end"
2956760,2963720," encryption. Yeah, for DMS. Yeah. Apparently they're working on that. So that's cool. That's good."
2963720,2969160," We got to, Hey, we got to talk about the good and the bad. If, uh, this is a good source,"
2969160,2976280," Jane is a good source, I will say. Um, they know that from Jane. That's cool. Uh, my, my favorite,"
2976280,2983400," my favorite of the week though, was the Thursday ultimatum, Twitter 2.0, asking Twitter staff to"
2983400,2991960," work long hours at high intensity and be, and I quote, extremely hard core or leave. Apparently,"
2991960,2998840," this ultimatum was refused by hundreds of the remaining 2,900 employees on Thursday."
2998840,3001640," If I remember correctly, the original number was 72,"
3001640,3009720," 2,200. That's a, that's a lot less. That's a lot less. Uh, many employees told reporters"
3009720,3014120," that with so many people leaving, they expect the platform to quote, start breaking soon and"
3014120,3018280," quote, leading to yet another round of everyone on Twitter saying they're leaving Twitter and then"
3018280,3025080," staying. That sounds about accurate. We also have a lot of stuff. We had people saying like,"
3025080,3029160," Oh, Twitter's going to break in two days when Elon first bought it and stuff like that."
3029160,3034200," It's going to take a little bit longer. Um, because the infrastructure systems have probably"
3034200,3039960," built recently. Well, who knows some, some improperly managed system is going to fill a hard drive"
3039960,3043640," and things are going to break or something random is going to happen. It's not going to get managed"
3043640,3053000," properly. Um, but, uh, or it might just not, I don't know. I, I, I've said for a long time, well,"
3053000,3059000," before we thought Elon might be buying Twitter that they have far too many people on staff. Um,"
3059000,3064200," yep, and that things can be true. He can be firing too many people and the wrong people,"
3064200,3068120," many people on staff. Yeah. He could be firing the wrong people absolutely."
3068120,3074040," Yeah. I could totally be a problem. Um, the way he's lowering his staff counts, uh, are far from"
3074040,3079160," perfect and I'm not defending those. If I was a superstar developer, Luke, I would be out of there."
3079160,3083640," Like there is gone, of course, absolutely. No way. There's, there's two paths, right? There's either"
3083640,3090280," you're gone or you take this position, you take this opportunity, divide for just extreme position"
3090280,3095400," and extreme total compensation. You do one of the two, right? Because you either need your total"
3095400,3100360," compensation to like double in your position to just become like something wild that's going to be"
3100360,3105720," really insane on your, on your resume or you need to get out of there and get somewhere else. Um,"
3105720,3111640," if you, if you think that it can make it, taking this opportunity to buy for position could be good."
3111640,3118680," That's quite the bet. And you might kind of not look that bright, uh, if you ride it all the way"
3118680,3126120," through to the end. So it's a, that's genuinely quite the bet. Um, but yeah, I don't know."
3126120,3131400," I don't know what I know. Is it's time to tell you about our sponsors for the when show?"
3131400,3135720," We do have more Twitter stuff to go over. Should we finish that really quick?"
3135720,3137400," Yeah. I mean, okay."
3137400,3142760," He locked everyone out of the office by, yeah, completely getting rid of their whole badge system."
3142760,3146760," Yeah. That was pretty good. Everyone thought the website was going to disappear last night."
3146760,3154040," It didn't going to be more fun. I'm excited. Yeah. All right. Um, the show is brought to you by"

3244840,3251400," lightweight, easy to pack sneakers and they use a, okay, so we've had some discussions with Vessy"
3251400,3257880," about this particular talking point. They say waterproof. I say nothing is waterproof."
3257880,3264600," They say by the standards by which waterproof garments are measured, it's waterproof, to which I"
3264600,3269800," say, okay, fair enough. So we've made a slight tweak to our wording and that's going to be that"
3269800,3276680," Vessy says our waterproof and which I say, water defeats all. Water literally cuts canyons into"
3276680,3283320," the earth. Nothing is waterproof. It's not a word that I like, but okay, Vessy, you say it's waterproof."
3283320,3289720," Fine. The point is it's a lightweight, breathable material that keeps you warm in the winter and cool"
3289720,3295720," in the summer. And with Vessy, you can simplify deciding what shoes to wear because it just"
3295720,3301080," doesn't matter. Is it going to be rain or shine or hot or cold? Your Vessys are good to go. They're"

3316440,3325480," I'm crying. This is hilarious. Okay, look, look, it's just, it's a thing. We had a conversation about"
3325480,3331480," it and we and Vessy were good. Oh, no, so I was just spawning on Flow Play, not you."
3331480,3336600," Okay. All right. We're fine. We're fine. Okay. All right. Everything's good. It's just water."
3336600,3342040," One last thing I want to throw in about Twitter is there's people working there that are on Vesses"
3342040,3349320," and their Vesser requires them to have employment and they have been suddenly let go. And the Vessa"
3349320,3355640," doesn't care that you have a three-month sevridge. The Vesser starts ticking right away."
3356760,3361720," So if you are hiring in the tech industry, there's some people that are going to be"
3361720,3368680," eager to full positions. Yeah. And try to be quick because their lives are going to be"
3368680,3375880," very uprooted. Yeah. Yeah. That is that is the main blow from all of this, in my opinion."
3375880,3381560," Oh, the bird was eating out of your mouth? I missed that. No, I have literally no idea what"
3381560,3385480," that person is talking about that has never happened. That is super weird. I have no idea."
3385480,3390680," I mean, okay. I'll agree that you feel that that's weird. This is like the Vessy situation."
3390680,3395160," Okay. I'll agree that Luke feels that it's weird, but I have personally watched my..."
3395160,3399240," You're not finding that weird. I've watched my aunt feed her bird out of her mouth like"
3399240,3403880," thousands of times so it just doesn't phase me anymore. She would just like nibble a little"
3403880,3407080," piece of fruit and then just go like this and her bird would be like, \"Yep.\" And take it. Yeah."
3407080,3412120," I don't know. I mean, it's not something I'm into. It's bad. Yeah."
3412120,3415160," Oh, no. It's not like... That's better than I thought. And then like..."
3415160,3419320," It's not like that. I was like holding CD in your mouth and you're like, \"Okay."
3419320,3424520," No, nobody's talking about it. That's better than that.\""

3467000,3475160," down below. Now, I actually need to bail pretty quickly today because I am heading off to a pretty"
3475160,3481640," fun little event that I'm going to. I think I have to go very, very shortly. But if there's"
3481640,3485080," maybe one more topic that we want to talk about, man, there's so much. We never talked about the"
3485080,3489560," FTX debacle. We haven't talked about that on WAN show. How's that even possible?"
3489560,3496200," That's nuts. We didn't talk about Pokémon, which I actually have completely regards to"
3496200,3500680," being Pokémon, strong opinions on. We didn't talk about do-maternal soundtrack allegations."
3500680,3506200," We didn't talk about that. We're hiring like 15 positions. I'm going to run through that"
3506200,3511480," really quick. You can check out LinusMediaGroup.com for more details. But for Linus Media Group,"
3511480,3517000," we're hiring a social media manager, a video editor/camera operator, a production assistant,"
3517000,3522680," a writer/video producer. Whoop, this just moved. An affiliate and sales coordinator,"
3522680,3528280," a bookkeeper, and a writer/video producer focused on Apple. So that would be for MAC address."
3528280,3533640," For creator warehouse, we are hiring a customer service supervisor, a customer service representative."
3533640,3537240," This is a three-month contract. This one, everything else is full-time, permanent position,"
3537240,3542200," an electronics engineer/product designer, a FIT technician, and then for Flowplane. We're"
3542200,3546840," hiring a junior backend developer. These are paused. Oh, they're paused. Oh, okay."
3546840,3550680," Flowplane ones are paused. We're still collecting resumes, and they're going to resume some time"
3550680,3554280," in the new year. They're paused right now because we just onboarded like"
3554280,3562520," debit people. Okay, cool. What about the Flowplane? We want to get the team good,"
3562520,3564680," and then we're going to get to-- What about the Flowplane/Labs one?"
3564680,3571560," Those are the same thing. Okay, same thing. Okay, I won't say any of that then. Okay, cool."
3571560,3579640," Oh, no. Someone's filling out-- Riley is filling out the FTX debacle in real time."
3580360,3585160," Oh, is he here? Does Riley want to just come join the show with you maybe? Because I think he"
3585160,3592440," actually prepped almost all of the topics this week. He says, \"If you ignore the rest, just open"
3592440,3599160," this one.\" Oh, no. People who are still holding digital assets on centralized exchanges right now."
3599160,3604760," Why? Even if Bitcoin moons to a million dollars or something, it means nothing if the exchange"
3604760,3609720," you're using goes belly up and your funds get hacked overnight. That happened to me. That happened"
3609720,3615240," to me many years ago. That was on-- In fairness to you? With Drigga CX. Yeah, this wasn't as big of a"
3615240,3620440," thing yet, but what did you lose? This was a long time ago. Yeah, and"
3620440,3627080," with Drigga CX, the founder mysteriously died in an Indian town famous for faking people's deaths."
3627080,3633720," That's weird. Wonder why he was there, and the entire exchange's funds just vanished. And that"
3633720,3640280," was my like, \"You know what? I'm done. I'm out.\" I had purchased hardware wallets. I was even going"
3640280,3647080," the right safe way. They had very, very recently shown up, and I hadn't moved it over yet. And then"
3647080,3654520," it was just gone. And that was my exit. I was done with crypto that way. I had a bunch of people in"
3654520,3658520," the crypto space. When they heard about that, be like, \"Yeah, you're just dumb.\" And I was like,"
3658520,3666680," \"All right. Sounds good. I'm out.\" Sorry. Bear enough. Sorry. I will leave. Yeah."
3666680,3674840," Uh, hold on. Let me just see if there's a-- Oh, man. There's so much. You know what? I think I"
3674840,3680280," just have to go. I'm going to like this exhibition, and I'll wait until-- Want me to try to tackle"
3680280,3683880," some of these topics? Do you want me to do merch messages, or do you want this percentage?"
3683880,3688120," Oh, that's what I'll do. I'll do a couple of merch messages now before I go. And then I think"
3688120,3692760," I'm trying to get in touch with Riley. Dan, actually, do you want to see if you can get Riley down here?"
3692760,3697080," Maybe he and Luke can close out the show. I shot him a message, but I can go grab him."
3697080,3700280," Give him a call. Yeah. Give him a call, or I'll just read through some of the curated"
3700280,3704280," merch messages. A second second. Mitchell O says, \"Hey, Luke. A few weeks ago on WAN Show,"
3704280,3708440," you said you were into scuba diving. Do you use dive computer if so which one?\" There's no way he"
3708440,3717240," uses a dive computer. Dive computers cost money. I, uh, so I absolutely tend to use dive computers,"
3717240,3722600," but I don't own one. When I go diving, I usually ask the shop if I can borrow one,"
3722600,3731560," and usually they're down, which is nice. It's smart. I was actually-- I was diving extremely"
3731560,3736120," recently. I got two certifications. I got my advanced and I got my rec-diver certification."
3736120,3743240," And the guy that I did it with would not stop talking about how I needed to buy a diving computer."
3744440,3749240," I do not want to, but we'll see. It depends how much you dive. Like, if you only dive when you"
3749240,3753960," vacation and you always have a certified dive master with you who's like, knows the location"
3753960,3757960," really well, what are you using your dive computer for? If you're lost, you surface."
3757960,3762760," Like it's that simple. Patty education would tell you that you should have them anyways and stuff."
3762760,3770680," But yeah, if I'm going right now, my pattern, COVID did cause a lot of this, but my pattern is"
3770680,3776440," like once every two to three years. So at that rate, it's like, yeah, even if they made me pay for it,"
3776440,3781400," which no one has so far, I can usually just borrow one from the shop that I'm diving with."
3781400,3787560," Yeah. And I'm never just going by myself at home. So yeah. Diving in the lower mainland sucks."
3787560,3794760," It's cold. Yeah, we've actually seen anything. We brought someone on. I won't say exactly where"
3794760,3800840," they're from, but they are they are local as in they are from this province. And they are super,"
3800840,3805480," super into diving. They're on the labs web dev team. I won't say their name either,"
3805480,3811080," just because they're very new. But they're like really, really into diving. And they have some"
3811080,3816200," cool spots that are localish, but I don't think it's lower mainland. We're not at all these"
3816200,3822200," diving the Fraser River and anything can be gross. Got a good question from Jonas. No,"
3822200,3826280," I don't think this is a dumb question, Jonas. With graphics cards getting bigger and physically"
3826280,3831480," taking up two PCIe slots, could there be any advantage to building a graphics card with two"
3831480,3836920," PCIe connections to the motherboard greetings from Germany? A couple of reasons that you wouldn't"
3836920,3842360," want to do that is one, you would, yes, you would double the bandwidth to the GPU, but you would"
3842360,3848360," also dramatically increase the complexity of the PCI express interface that you have to build into"
3848360,3856280," the GPU. That's why they keep doubling the over the bandwidth of PCIe. That's why each generation,"
3856280,3864760," we're trying to push the signals faster rather than just going wider, because every pin on the slot,"
3864760,3870040," you got to think about it this way. Every signal pin on the slot has to have a corresponding signal"
3870040,3877400," pin somewhere on whatever processor it will ultimately connect to, right? So if you had 32"
3877400,3885240," lanes of PCIe and to be clear, longer slots actually do exist. PCIe 16 is not the widest PCIe"
3885240,3892120," connection that you can get. I guess, I don't know if there's a spec limit."
3892120,3897480," Anyway, the point is 16 is not the maximum, but for every one of those connections,"
3897480,3901720," like it has to terminate somewhere, right? These are essentially wires that have to go"
3901720,3908200," somewhere. So you're adding a lot of, you're adding a lot of just even physical complexity"
3908200,3914760," to whatever die is on the other side. So if you had a PCIe by 32 connection, like man, would that"
3914760,3919960," ever be a complex chip? Wouldn't it be better to just go gen five if you needed to double your bandwidth?"
3919960,3925480," So that's what we've done. We've gone from gen one, two, three, four, five, which has resulted in a"
3927960,3933160," 32x increase in overall bandwidth to the slot, which has been fine."
3933160,3941720," Okay, I'll do just a couple more. And then I guess Yvonne and I head out. Yes, she hasn't"
3941720,3948840," messaged me yet. Anonymous asks, can we get a banana for scale with catnip? I don't think we"
3948840,3952840," have plans to do that anytime soon, but you could always stuff catnip inside your banana for scale,"
3952840,3958680," and your cat would probably love that. Okay, I think Riley's going to take over for me at this"
3958680,3970120," point. Riley, you haven't been on Wenshow set in, I think, a minute. So can I just orient you real"
3970120,3975560," quick here? He does their just movies. Yeah, but I haven't shown him like how merch messages work,"
3975560,3981480," so stuff like that. To warp speed. Well, no, no, it's it's it's ludicrous speed. Then Plaid, I think,"
3981480,3987560," is is how everything works. I know we had upgraded to that. Okay, so I've got the doc over here,"
3987560,3990920," got the chats that matter over here. Don't worry about YouTube chat. Nobody looks at that."
3990920,3997480," This tab is the merch messages. So if Dan has one that's not like, that's a potential,"
3997480,4001240," and you can check it and see if you guys want to do it. And I guess that's pretty much it. All"
4001240,4009480," right, see you later. See you later. Good luck at your event, Linus. Yeah, thank you. It's gonna be fun."
4011240,4017240," It better be. Or else, what am I here for? Hi, Luke."
4017240,4023880," Wait, why can I hear Luke? Am I not supposed to hear Luke?"
4023880,4029240," I'm just supposed to talk over him the whole time. I don't think he's talking. This is the right,"
4029240,4034200," he was talking. I saw his lips moving. Luke, stop it. Your lips are moving. Is this the wrong"
4034200,4039240," headset? No, you're, it's warm. It's warm. I feel Linus's sweat on my head. Is he trolling?"
4040440,4043720," Am I trolling? I'm not trolling. Luke, I think Luke's trolling."
4043720,4048280," Luke, stop it. Luke, stop it. You're so mean to us. This isn't your mic is muted. We're a"
4048280,4054360," professional company that does shows unmute your microphone. Just like this one. Do you see the"
4054360,4062440," mute button? Oh, yeah. As soon as in pain. What? Yeah, yeah, or excuse me. Luke, you are muted."
4062440,4067400," He is muted. No, no, you are. They sang your muted. I can see the icon in the in the chat app."
4068120,4075960," Why has this gone wrong? As soon as I. As soon as I heard Linus say, oh, Riley, uh, Riley could come"
4075960,4081800," and be on the WAN show. I'm like that you don't want that. You do not want this. Something will break."
4081800,4087000," Oh no. You don't want me reviewing graphics cards and you don't want me."
4087000,4095640," Stepping in the can. I'm trying to see if my. Oh, there he is. Hi, Luke. You figured it out."
4095640,4101640," I think a magical little pixie in the internet just came and fixed that for us. So you run a video"
4101640,4110760," platform? I was. I did not mute myself to be clear. There was there was something wrong. I was"
4110760,4115960," trying to talk to you guys in the chat and as per usual with WAN show, whenever there's a technical"
4115960,4119880," issue where we can't hear each other, no one tries to read anything that's typed anywhere,"
4119880,4125160," which has some pretty serious problems. That's why I didn't come down right away because I didn't"
4125160,4131640," use the messages you know, which is very strange. Oh, cinematic mode. I have no, I noticed that."
4131640,4137560," So something happened around the time of the Linus and Riley change the bars came in and other"
4137560,4145240," problems came in. I think. Yeah, I don't know. Were you the one that man muted me, by the way,"
4145240,4153320," spam me. Did I spam me? Dan Dan. What did you do Dan? I tried to mute you and then unmute you and"
4153320,4159560," it just said mute twice. So that that made it so that I was muted. So I was able to unmute myself."
4159560,4164600," I figured I would try something like that. So it's Dan's it's your Dan it's Dan's fault."
4164600,4168520," No, I don't know what happened to you. Either way, it's working now. Sure. Thank you."
4168520,4175000," Welcome to show Riley. Hey, thanks. Why did he want me to come? I mean, I know I was I was editing"
4175000,4180040," the doc in the talk. Yeah, we got more stuff to talk about and it seems like you had an"
4180040,4185880," result. It seems like you had unresolved feelings about Twitter. But we don't have to go back to that."
4185880,4191000," We can go back to that. Honestly, I wrote for the discussion question for that one. I have nothing"
4191000,4197480," more to say because after covering it for two weeks or more, I mean, before that before he"
4197480,4202360," actually took control two weeks ago, I was tired of covering it. And then the last two weeks have"
4202360,4208440," just been it's like it's like I fight. Yeah, go ahead. I'm honestly not that interested in talking"
4208440,4211160," about it for whatever reason. People just need to like."
4211160,4217080," See it for themselves. And then that's it because there's too much going like if you actually want"
4217080,4221000," coverage of this whole thing, it's going to take you a whole day."
4221000,4226360," Right. This is going on. Well, by the hour, there's crazy things happening. Yeah, and it's"
4226360,4233800," fun because tweeting at two in the morning, like how. He's tweeting to in the morning and instead of"
4233800,4238120," being like anything serious about the fact that like the platform that you bought for $44 billion"
4238120,4240680," dollars is in chaos. He's just posting memes."
4240680,4242840," Make it all up. Yeah. Like."
4242840,4251400," Yeah. So like it. It's especially hard because it's about this platform that is all about"
4251400,4256520," immediate reactions. It's about like short quick takes. And so people feel the need to"
4256520,4265720," post news immediately. Like there's one reporter. I'm pretty sure I linked her in here somewhere,"
4265720,4269960," but she works for the platformer and she's been doing a lot of the like on the ground"
4269960,4274280," reporting, like talking to Twitter employees and stuff. And even she tweeted something."
4274280,4278760," I feel bad if I don't find her account now, but I'm not in my accounts here. So I don't"
4278760,4284040," know how to find it. She even she tweeted this morning like, Oh, I'm just seeing this email that"
4284040,4288200," says this. And then she tweeted a couple more times about it. And she's like, actually, I'm"
4288200,4292600," not sure whether this is real. Hold on. Yeah. I was like, okay. It's another huge problem."
4292600,4294120," Yeah. I keep you saying earlier."
4294120,4299640," It's stuff going around, but there's also genuated genuine just like crazy things happening and how"
4299640,4303720," you differentiate between fabricated things and crazy things. It's just like,"
4303720,4310760," Zoe, Zoe Shiffer, the chat is helping me out. Zoe Shiffer. Yeah. She works for platformer."
4310760,4316520," A lot of good reporting on it, but you know, no one's perfect. But yeah, I don't, I didn't really"
4316520,4321240," have anything else to say about it. At this point, it's just kind of like, we'll see what happens."
4321880,4326520," Maybe Twitter will die. Even if Twitter dies, though, it'll come back. I feel like it. I feel like,"
4326520,4334040," whatever happens, Twitter as an entity, it may be something completely different to what Twitter is"
4334040,4340040," now, but Twitter itself will be around. It's a big brand. Someone's going to do something with it,"
4340040,4345880," you know, that being said, like my space went down. I guess something someone did do something with it."
4345880,4351000," Right. It's being used right now. That's true. But I feel like, okay, I've heard you talk. Okay,"
4351000,4354840," let's not talk a long time about Twitter, but I've heard you talk on Wancho a number of times"
4354840,4360760," about how you hate Twitter. Yeah. And every time you said that, I'm like, kind of hurts,"
4360760,4368440," because I love Twitter, because it's different from the other platforms. It's, it's, you don't"
4368440,4374440," have to post an image like Instagram. It's not made up of all these discrete like groups and,"
4374440,4380360," and like a million different components like Facebook. It's just, if you want to just post a"
4380360,4385160," couple of words, you can just do it. And it's fine. You know, I don't want to do that."
4385160,4389480," Well, if you don't want to do that's fine. But I like it because it's like, especially for,"
4389480,4394200," you know, people who appreciate tell people to not use Twitter, I used to be like, you should"
4394200,4397480," get off Twitter. You should go outside and touch grass. I don't really do that anymore,"
4397480,4401720," because I had some feedback similar to kind of what you're saying. And I'm like, you know what,"
4401720,4406040," that has value. I just don't personally see a lot of value in it. But that doesn't mean that the"
4406040,4411160," value isn't there. Right. I don't, I don't tell like tell other people not to use it anymore."
4411160,4415400," But I think, and I think this is actually this whole thing going on right now is a perfect"
4415400,4421560," example of how good it is at this. I think it's all power isn't spreading negativity."
4421560,4426840," It's really good at amplifying negative messages. That's like the main thing that it's good at."
4426840,4428440," I never do say that."
4428440,4435160," The Twitter being saved by the 2016 election totally makes sense, because we've never had as much"
4435160,4440120," negativity around an election as we did around that one for America, whatever."
4440120,4445640," I feel like I agree with you, but I would also say that it probably excels as well at"
4445640,4453560," amplifying extremely positive and heartwarming stuff. It's like, it won't, and I think that this"
4453560,4459640," is kind of any social media platform, extreme sentiments, whether they're negative or positive."
4459640,4460440," We'll always do better."
4460440,4464600," Do well. If you put something out there and be like, I'm watching the show right now,"
4464600,4471080," it's pretty good. No one cares. As I've discovered trying to tweet about Andor,"
4471080,4477400," which is an amazing show, but it's still a Star Wars Disney show. Let's not get into that."
4477400,4478360," But I'm just saying that-"
4478360,4480280," I'm going to watch it because of you."
4480280,4480520," Dude."
4480520,4484360," I haven't talked to you about this. I am only going to watch it because of you."
4484360,4485320," Oh my gosh."
4485320,4489080," You're going to be so frustrated why more people aren't-"
4489080,4492280," No, I understand why they're not watching it because the other shows were complete."
4492280,4495160," I mean, I don't want to say they're complete garbage, but they made me angry."
4495160,4504680," They're not good. And Andor is like, somebody made a good show for HBO Light,"
4504680,4510280," and it happens to be a Star Wars show, and it's faithful to lore,"
4510280,4514520," and is actually made by people who know how to make a TV show."
4514520,4516840," It's just- Watch Andor-"
4516840,4518360," That's mind-boggling for a Star Wars fan."
4518920,4522520," So yeah, I'll try to- Yeah. And as someone who absolutely hates what Disney has done with them,"
4522520,4526280," I was surprised to like it, but I love it because it's good."
4526280,4536680," Twitter, it'll go away. I just hope that there is another if Twitter dies, or if Twitter is"
4536680,4544200," unable to be revived in its current form. I hope that another social media platform will arise"
4544200,4552680," with the same kind of lack of care for posting. On Instagram, people try too hard."
4552680,4556200," Facebook, I don't even know what's going on there. It's taking over my mom's."
4556200,4562520," TikTok is ADHD too much stimulation. I can't handle it. Twitter is more chill,"
4562520,4566200," and it's just like we're posting jokes because we thought of a funny joke,"
4566200,4567160," and you just write it down."
4567160,4571240," Twitter is very much the social media platform that you use while you're getting coffee."
4571240,4573880," Like it's- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, for sure."
4573880,4578280," Someone's like, \"Do they're just movies with Luke? We did. We did hackers. Go watch it.\""
4578280,4585400," It's actually really fun. I wish I cared more about movies and TV shows, so I should go on it more,"
4585400,4589320," but I don't. I forgot on a TV show that I watch, actually."
4589320,4591320," Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, you're saying you don't watch it."
4591320,4593480," Very infrequently. You guys told me to-"
4593480,4596440," But it's not going to be interesting to talk about on the show."
4596440,4597800," Well, just say what it is."
4597800,4600440," \"Passmaster.\" What is that?"
4600440,4604520," It's like a British game show."
4604520,4607720," I've heard the name I just completed. Forget what the subject matters."
4607720,4609880," Oh, was it like a comedy thing?"
4609880,4610920," Read this cover right every once in a while."
4610920,4617480," Yeah, they usually have comedians on, and then they have them do various tasks,"
4617480,4619960," and then they're graded on how well they do the tasks."
4619960,4625160," And because it's comedians, and for the most part, it seems like they are trying to"
4625160,4628680," make an entertaining thing to watch instead of necessarily competing against each other."
4628680,4632680," They're still trying to win, but you can tell that they're going for the entertainment value."
4632680,4634200," It's really funny."
4634200,4638120," It's sort of like those lines that they come up with being able to play and stuff."
4638120,4639640," But yeah, I enjoy \"Passmaster.\""
4639640,4644680," I will usually binge watch it a little bit, and then forget about it for a year or more,"
4644680,4646920," and then binge watch it a little bit again."
4646920,4649000," But they have full episodes on YouTube."
4649000,4650040," Oh, wow. Nice."
4650040,4651400," And it's not country locked."
4651400,4652520," So I was just like, \"Oh.\""
4652520,4655000," I feel like I've definitely seen clips of this show."
4655000,4659320," It's kind of like whose line is it anyway, but less like we're doing a skit with a"
4659320,4663080," bunch of people and more like one person has to kind of go off for a while, and then other people"
4663080,4663480," rate them."
4663480,4667320," No? Isn't that like kind of like improv comedy?"
4667320,4669080," Like you give a prompt, and then they kind of..."
4669080,4672040," Or is it like they're actually doing physical tasks?"
4672040,4672680," I thought it was like..."
4672680,4673320," You're doing physical tasks."
4673320,4673880," Absolutely."
4673880,4674040," Yeah."
4674040,4675320," I'm thinking of the show."
4675320,4679960," I feel like there's other shows where someone gives like a prompt, and then you have to like"
4679960,4681640," come up with something."
4681640,4686440," No, like they'll film all of the task challenges before they film the show,"
4686440,4691560," and then the show is actually them watching the taskmaster, and the taskmaster like giving them..."
4691560,4693000," This is a really weird way of shows."
4693000,4693880," We should..."
4693880,4696040," Well, he brought me on. I mean, what do you expect?"
4696040,4697640," No, this is fair. This is fair."
4697640,4700280," But we should jump into the FTX thing."
4700280,4703800," I feel like you have probably tracked this significantly better than I have."
4703800,4704360," Sort of."
4704360,4708200," So like what I wanted to say about the FTX thing is that..."
4708920,4709560," You know, since the..."
4709560,4713800," Before you go into it, just for people that have no idea what they even are."
4713800,4715080," Oh, yeah."
4715080,4715880," Oh, FTX."
4715880,4721000," So the FTX is a cryptocurrency exchange owned by..."
4721000,4725240," Or started by a guy named Sam Bankman Freed,"
4725240,4725640," Fried."
4725640,4726680," I don't know how to say his name."
4726680,4727240," Freed."
4727240,4732840," And he was like viewed as sort of a prodigy, became a huge billionaire."
4732840,4733400," Very rich."
4733400,4737400," Loves League of Legends."
4737400,4738680," So that should tell you something."
4739480,4740760," About how, where this is going."
4740760,4742680," Degenerate."
4742680,4745000," If you play League of Legends."
4745000,4747080," Everything else is fine."
4747080,4749320," You can't call anything else Degenerate nowadays,"
4749320,4751240," but League of Legends, that's the thing."
4751240,4752440," You can say it's Degenerate."
4752440,4753480," It's fine."
4753480,4754120," Oh, okay."
4754120,4754440," Yeah."
4754440,4756520," In case you didn't know that they released the game."
4756520,4759000," What I do know is that he's really bad at League of Legends."
4759000,4760280," This was honestly, I think..."
4760280,4760760," I didn't even know."
4760760,4762920," The most disappointing part of this whole story to me."
4762920,4766680," Because we're going to talk about how this guy screwed people over millions and billions of dollars."
4766680,4768600," And that's really obviously disappointing."
4768600,4772520," But the thing that impacted me the most is that this person apparently has"
4772520,4775960," hundreds of games potentially over a thousand hours."
4775960,4777960," Like, lots and lots of time in League of Legends."
4777960,4780600," And it's stuck at hard stuck in bronze."
4780600,4781160," I was trying."
4781160,4782200," Yeah."
4782200,4782840," We should just..."
4782840,4784120," So cringe dude."
4784120,4784840," I saw..."
4784840,4786840," I just read an article..."
4786840,4789000," I just read an article that was saying..."
4789000,4792360," Well, I didn't read it, but like, as I was about to come on set here,"
4792360,4795400," I was like, oh my gosh, I don't know enough about this to talk about it."
4795400,4797160," So that I was like, try to look stuff up real quick."
4797160,4799960," And I found an article about how when he was on business meetings,"
4799960,4801400," people would hear clicks in the background."
4801400,4804680," And he had a reputation for playing League of Legends"
4804680,4807320," while on conference calls for business."
4807320,4808680," Wow."
4808680,4811880," That's actually amazing."
4811880,4812920," APM was huge."
4812920,4815960," Still hard stuck in bronze though."
4815960,4816760," So basically..."
4816760,4821640," So basically with the FTX thing, what I understand about it,"
4821640,4825000," I didn't follow absolutely everything, every development."
4825000,4828120," Because honestly, since the crypto crash earlier this year,"
4828120,4831880," I have not paid attention as much to crypto stuff."
4831880,4838840," Because I think that it has largely kind of passed out of the mainstream view."
4838840,4840040," I mean, I don't want to say that because..."
4840040,4840600," It's called that movie there."
4840600,4841080," Yeah."
4841080,4841960," There are still like..."
4841960,4843800," FTX had their name on a sports arena."
4843800,4845240," I don't know which one."
4845240,4845720," I don't remember."
4845720,4850440," But you know, we're probably not going to be seeing Super Bowl ads for crypto coins"
4850440,4851400," anytime soon again."
4851400,4852200," Or maybe we will."
4852200,4854520," I don't even know when the Super Bowl is."
4854520,4855320," Is it an April?"
4855320,4858680," It's around there."
4858680,4859400," I should know this."
4859400,4860840," That's how I expected you to know."
4860840,4861800," But what am I thinking?"
4861800,4862600," I actually don't know."
4862600,4866280," All I know is I get a notification from my brother and my dad every year."
4866280,4867640," And they're like, \"Hey, we're watching the Super Bowl."
4867640,4868280," It's on this day.\""
4868280,4868760," And I show up."
4868760,4870360," That's it."
4870360,4870840," Exactly."
4870840,4874040," My mom makes chili and it's a family thing."
4874040,4878680," But nobody watches it before the Super Bowl."
4878680,4882040," Anyways, apparently as far as I can tell,"
4882040,4883720," this is like the TLDR."
4883720,4885720," Sam Bankman Freed was..."
4885720,4888040," He started FTX, the exchange."
4888040,4894920," He was using funds from that exchange as collateral on another one of his companies"
4894920,4896920," called Alameda Research."
4896920,4901080," He made some wrong decisions."
4901080,4905000," It caused the collapse of the exchange."
4905880,4913960," Binance, one of the other huge crypto exchanges in the world, at first they were arguing about it."
4913960,4917400," At first they had animosity."
4917400,4920600," And then Binance was like, \"Okay, we'll bail you out.\""
4920600,4925000," Because the two founders of these exchanges actually do know each other and they've been"
4925000,4926760," they're both in the same sphere."
4926760,4928600," And Binance said, \"We bail you out.\""
4928600,4935000," But then they backed out leaving Sam Bankman Freed in dire straits."
4935000,4940200," And many coins, many crypto coins lost a huge amount of value, including Solana."
4940200,4947240," And that's basically like the super, super TLDR of the situation, as far as I understand it."
4947240,4950360," As far as my understanding, a couple of just little juicy details."
4950360,4951800," And this is alleged..."
4951800,4953240," I'm going to put allegedly on this."
4953240,4958120," But as far as my understanding goes, he said that he was not leveraging or like gambling"
4958120,4962520," with users' funds that were inputting stuff into the FTX exchange."
4963080,4968600," The problem is that FTX was loaning out money to Alameda Research."
4968600,4972200," And then Alameda Research was leveraging and gambling with that money."
4972200,4975560," But he was like, \"FTX is not going to do this.\""
4975560,4976040," Right, right."
4976040,4977800," Which blended the money to another group that was doing it."
4977800,4978760," So technically, right."
4978760,4981720," He's like, \"Technically they're not doing it, but they're doing it.\""
4981720,4982920," Yeah."
4982920,4986440," There's like, \"Okay, were there some degrees of separation that somehow makes it okay?\""
4986440,4987640," And there are..."
4987640,4991560," There's a lot of things that you would expect a legal legends player to do in this story."
4991560,4992040," Yeah."
4992040,4992600," Yeah."
4992600,4995160," I guess the main question..."
4995160,4997080," One of the..."
4997080,4998120," Yeah, exactly."
4998120,4998760," Get him."
4998760,4999480," Drag him."
4999480,5005800," One of the questions that this kind of brought up for me, I guess, was like..."
5005800,5010360," People have been talking about cryptocurrency and like regulating it for so long."
5010360,5013160," And obviously, that kind of goes against..."
5013160,5017240," I mean, like, you guys brought up the tweet earlier that I thought was hilarious from Jeff"
5017240,5020040," Gereling, just being like, \"It has never made sense.\""
5020040,5021000," Like, the whole idea..."
5021000,5025320," The whole point you would get into cryptocurrency is to have a decentralized currency."
5025320,5029240," And then, when you put it in an exchange, it's just like, \"What's the benefit?\""
5029240,5031160," Now it's just centralized."
5031160,5032840," Now it's just different money."
5032840,5035320," I think I can kind of answer that, actually."
5035320,5035800," Please."
5035800,5037400," It's people that don't care about that aspect."
5037400,5040200," They want it as a monetary vehicle."
5040200,5043240," They want something that they can effectively gamble with,"
5043240,5044200," with an investment."
5044200,5046920," They don't care about the fact that it's decentralized."
5046920,5050120," They don't care about any of the features of the different coins."
5050120,5052360," They're not into the technical aspect of it at all."
5052360,5056280," They just go, \"Okay, well, the line has gone up for a while.\""
5056280,5059480," And then it went down, and I'm going to buy the dip,"
5059480,5061400," and then it's going to go up, and I'll sell it again."
5061400,5061880," Yeah."
5061880,5065640," So they're not worried about taking off exchange or the decentralized aspects."
5065640,5068920," And then obviously, there are tons of people that do care about those."
5068920,5074920," But I think a lot of the people on exchanges are people that see the Super Bowl ads and whatever"
5074920,5078520," else, and they see the line going up, and they hear about billionaires that are made off of crypto,"
5078520,5079960," and they're like, \"Okay, I'll buy some.\""
5079960,5082360," And then they leave it on the exchange, because they're not technical,"
5082360,5083320," and they don't care about those kinds of things."
5083320,5083960," Yeah."
5083960,5085560," And to me, that's the main..."
5085560,5090360," Every time we talk about cryptocurrency, I feel a bit bad,"
5090360,5095640," because way back in the early 2000s, and people were talking about,"
5095640,5100120," \"Oh, before then, I forget, I thought it was early 2000s when this stuff really..."
5100120,5101400," or 2011 or something.\""
5103480,5105480," It wasn't a scam really back then."
5105480,5108680," People actually were trying to..."
5108680,5111160," They had some libertarian ideas about finance and..."
5111160,5113400," It was like the whole goal, what's the technical stuff?"
5113400,5114920," Government control of things."
5114920,5115560," The 50 word speculating."
5115560,5115960," Yeah."
5115960,5121000," Which is like, \"I'm not a libertarian, but I can understand that as a political ideology.\""
5121000,5124760," You're like, \"Hey, we think the government should have less say in what we do with our money,"
5124760,5127160," and what we're allowed to do.\""
5127160,5130680," And so, let's make these cryptocurrencies and the free people,"
5130680,5135640," especially in areas of the world where there are really oppressive governments,"
5135640,5138360," it would give some sort of freedom to people to do the things that they want."
5138360,5139560," Good destabilization."
5139560,5140120," Yeah."
5140120,5145080," So like, when you go all the way back, the idea of cryptocurrency was..."
5145080,5148920," I'm sure some people were in it just because they thought they could get rich,"
5148920,5151960," but for some of them, no doubt it was like a noble goal could be."
5151960,5155080," And for a considerable amount of people, it still is."
5155080,5159160," I just don't think those are the people that largely got screwed over by this."
5159800,5160680," Oh, for sure."
5160680,5166040," A lot of people that are speculators and people that are in it to make that money."
5166040,5166760," Yeah."
5166760,5170920," And some people are pointing out in the chat that those people do still exist."
5170920,5172520," And that's true."
5172520,5177800," Of course, there are people who are still involved in it because they have a hope that it could"
5177800,5179320," improve society in some way."
5179320,5189720," But I think that with these centralized exchanges, it allowed the bad actors"
5189720,5195560," who are in on things early to leave normies holding the bag."
5195560,5198040," It's like, \"Oh, we got you all hyped up for this stuff,"
5198040,5203560," and then we got your investment, and now we're going to get out while the getting's good.\""
5203560,5204520," And you're screwed."
5204520,5210280," That's one of the roughest things about crypto is there's been so many bodies on the path."
5210280,5219160," This is just another one of those scenarios where the people that I know"
5219160,5223240," that are really into it and they're doing it properly, I'm certain they weren't"
5223240,5224440," pushed by this."
5224440,5228040," Other than the fact that a lot of different cryptos are like, \"I hit.\""
5228040,5229400," Yeah."
5229400,5232760," But they didn't lose their coins."
5232760,5237000," Their coins may have lost USD value, but they didn't lose their coins."
5237000,5239720," Wait, did they?"
5239720,5241960," It's still, what do you mean?"
5241960,5245400," You're saying with the collapse of this exchange?"
5245400,5245880," Oh, right."
5245880,5247480," Because they didn't get hacked or anything."
5247480,5249000," It was just the value tanked."
5249000,5250280," There was..."
5250280,5253000," There was..."
5253000,5253720," Okay, no."
5253720,5254600," Oh, maybe it was."
5254600,5256360," On FTX, I think they lost their coins."
5256360,5258680," What I'm saying is people that don't deal with exchanges,"
5258680,5261080," because they're like, \"No, I'm into the decentralized aspects.\""
5261080,5261640," Oh, right. Yeah, sure."
5261640,5263080," Have it on cold wall and stuff like that."
5263080,5268680," Those people didn't lose their coins physically, but they might have lost some value or not."
5268680,5269080," I don't know."
5269080,5270200," It depends on what coins they're in."
5270200,5277160," But it just makes the whole space look gross when this type of stuff happens."
5277880,5282360," And I think that's something that a lot of crypto people have had a bit of a hard time"
5282360,5284760," either accepting or understanding, or I don't know,"
5284760,5286760," this whole time is..."
5286760,5291560," I think the reaction by a lot of the hard cores and stuff like this happens is"
5291560,5294840," it owned noob, you should have been on a cold wallet,"
5294840,5297960," which bear to a certain degree."
5297960,5302040," But as much as you want to react that way,"
5303800,5307480," as long as this type of stuff happens, I don't think it's going to"
5307480,5310360," hit the type of market adoption that they want it to."
5310360,5310760," No."
5310760,5315800," Well, it was nice to talk about FTX."
5315800,5318200," Like, this was the topic from today."
5318200,5321320," I was least prepared to discuss because I kind of..."
5321320,5321880," Yeah."
5321880,5323720," I'm way more familiar with the rest of it."
5323720,5325160," Well, what do you want to talk about?"
5325160,5327080," You wanted to talk about Pokemon, I know for sure."
5327080,5328600," I do want to talk about Pokemon."
5328600,5330360," But maybe that's no one cares about that."
5331160,5334280," Seems like people are upset that you get choppy frame rates."
5334280,5336040," Well, it's kind of ridiculous."
5336040,5338760," Oh, there's a source that is from me."
5338760,5339080," That's right."
5339080,5341720," I put you in there because I saw that you tweeted about it."
5341720,5342200," Oh, wow."
5342200,5342760," I honestly..."
5342760,5343720," I didn't know anyone saw this."
5343720,5346280," I put this in there because I knew that you would probably have an opinion."
5346280,5347880," Yeah."
5347880,5349960," This is ruining my reputation of not tweeting."
5349960,5351960," The best Pokemon that I've only..."
5351960,5353160," And then you replies."
5353160,5355800," The best Pokemon in any of any of them."
5355800,5359960," I have unironically heard that take."
5360920,5361960," The unironically."
5361960,5362760," Which one?"
5362760,5363800," Wait, which one?"
5363800,5364600," I didn't give a take."
5364600,5365880," That this game,"
5365880,5369080," Violet or whatever it's called, Scarlet, I don't know."
5369080,5369640," Is the best..."
5369640,5370360," Is the best Pokemon."
5370360,5370680," Oh, sorry."
5370680,5373560," No, I meant like which Pokemon, which..."
5373560,5375080," Oh, which individual Pokemon?"
5375080,5376440," Yeah, which one of my favorite Pokemon is?"
5376440,5376680," Yeah."
5376680,5379400," Personally, Cadabra."
5379400,5380680," Really?"
5380680,5382040," Yeah."
5382040,5382840," Because..."
5382840,5383960," Wait, Cadabra."
5383960,5385080," There's Abra."
5385080,5385560," The middle one."
5385560,5387000," Cadabra and then Alec is in it."
5387000,5387160," The middle one."
5387160,5387720," Right."
5387720,5387960," Yeah."
5388760,5391080," Because back in Red and Blue,"
5391080,5393720," the old school Game Boy cartridge games,"
5393720,5397160," my brother, I think it was,"
5397160,5398840," figured out that you could catch an Abra"
5398840,5403160," just north and west of Misty's gym."
5403160,5404600," The second gym that you run into."
5404600,5406520," There's this little thin patch of grass"
5406520,5407640," and you can catch an Abra."
5407640,5409000," My brother figured it out."
5409000,5410040," I don't know how he figured it out."
5410040,5411080," He might have spent a while in there."
5411080,5411560," I don't know."
5411560,5412920," I mean, there are secrets."
5412920,5413960," You could get an Abra there."
5413960,5415080," And we were both like,"
5415080,5415880," that's crazy."
5415880,5416920," That's an Abra."
5416920,5419240," The internet's not like so much of a thing yet."
5419240,5421000," But..."
5421000,5421560," It was magical."
5421560,5423160," Yeah, we figure out you can get Abra's in there."
5423160,5425000," We figure out that they're useless."
5425000,5425800," Ab, what do you mean?"
5425800,5428280," All they can do is teleport."
5428280,5431720," They can't learn any other moves."
5431720,5433560," If you put them out in battle"
5433560,5435160," and you use teleport,"
5435160,5437560," you just go back to the the focus stop or whatever."
5437560,5438120," The..."
5438120,5439080," Oh!"
5439080,5440360," The medical center."
5440360,5441000," I don't remember what it's called."
5441000,5441720," Wait, was that the..."
5441720,5442520," Yeah, because Abra,"
5442520,5443880," so I guess Abra was kind of like the..."
5443880,5445000," Well..."
5445000,5445640," Not a bit derp."
5445640,5446280," Not Metapod,"
5446280,5449000," because Metapod could still have the sting,"
5449000,5450440," the whatever, the one attack,"
5450440,5452040," instead of just hardened."
5452040,5452840," Are you just hardened?"
5452840,5453560," No, I mean,"
5453560,5456520," if you find a Metapod in the wild,"
5456520,5457640," it might just have hardened."
5457640,5460200," But if you evolve a Caterpie into a Metapod,"
5460200,5461320," it was a Caterpie."
5461320,5461880," I think it was."
5461880,5463720," They could have String Shot."
5463720,5466520," So you could harden and String Shot together."
5466520,5468200," No, it's very good."
5468200,5469000," Kind of a weird..."
5469000,5472440," Like, it seems weird together now to me."
5472440,5473480," You got a harden for birds."
5473480,5474200," You got a harden."
5474200,5477720," You've harden and then you can String Shot."
5477720,5478200," So..."
5478200,5479400," Yeah, that's the combo."
5479400,5480360," That's how you finish the battle."
5480360,5480840," This is..."
5480840,5482520," We would never do this on Tech Linked."
5482520,5486920," This is a Wanchow level of maturity."
5486920,5487640," Yeah."
5487640,5488200," Yeah."
5488200,5488680," Yeah."
5488680,5490760," So you would put Abra out first,"
5490760,5493240," and then you'd immediately swap him with your strong Pokemon,"
5493240,5495080," so that he got shared experience for the fight."
5495080,5496600," Your strong Pokemon would take a hit,"
5496600,5498040," but then it would beat whatever you're fighting."
5498040,5499080," Abra would get experience."
5499080,5500440," You eventually get Kadabra."
5500440,5501960," You fight with Kadabra for a little bit."
5501960,5503240," You eventually get Cybeam,"
5503240,5505480," and then you just one shot everything in the game."
5505480,5506520," He's so overpowered."
5506520,5507000," Cybeam."
5507000,5507960," It's actually crazy."
5507960,5509560," It's so nuts."
5509560,5511080," Don't sleep on Cybeam."
5511080,5512920," It's crazy."
5512920,5513560," And I never..."
5513560,5515800," We didn't have Link cables,"
5515800,5517240," but we couldn't trade,"
5517240,5518600," so we couldn't get Alakazam's."
5518600,5520600," Yeah."
5520600,5521080," Oh, right."
5521080,5521800," Yeah."
5521800,5523880," That all seems so rude."
5523880,5525400," It's like we're watching the show,"
5525400,5526280," we're excited,"
5526280,5528360," we wanted you to get the Pokemon."
5528360,5530760," And then if I don't have any friends,"
5530760,5532760," then I can't get Alakazam."
5532760,5534120," I'm being discriminated against."
5534120,5535160," Kank it, Gengar."
5535160,5537000," And Haunter is my second favorite Pokemon."
5537000,5539080," You can't get freaking Gengar, everybody."
5539080,5540200," Yeah."
5540200,5543000," So it was so frustrating,"
5543000,5545000," because both my two favorite Pokemon,"
5545000,5546680," I couldn't get to their favorite evolution,"
5546680,5548040," but they were sick anyways,"
5548040,5550280," because Haunter was also overpowered as hell"
5550280,5551160," back in those games."
5551160,5552920," Because all the normal type of attacks"
5552920,5554360," couldn't hit them at all."
5554360,5554920," Right, right."
5554920,5556680," And a huge percentage of Pokemon back then"
5556680,5557880," just have like tackle."
5557880,5558360," Okay."
5558360,5559480," So you can't touch them."
5559480,5559960," I..."
5559960,5560680," It was amazing."
5560680,5563080," I have been frustrated in the past"
5563080,5565400," with the fact that I spend a lot of time"
5565400,5566360," on WAN topics,"
5566360,5567480," and then you guys just like"
5567480,5569720," do whatever we're doing right now."
5569720,5570200," You want me to get that more topic?"
5570200,5570680," Sounds good."
5570680,5573080," Well, but I'm realizing how difficult it is,"
5573080,5574840," so I don't feel angry anymore."
5574840,5576280," Because..."
5576280,5576760," That's good."
5576760,5577640," It..."
5577640,5579080," I just want to talk about Pokemon."
5579080,5581000," Yeah, things just happen."
5581000,5581480," Pokemon..."
5581480,5582120," This is a topic,"
5582120,5584600," so let's get back onto the actual Pokemon topic."
5584600,5585480," What do you know about it?"
5585480,5587560," Because you know more than me, probably, honestly."
5587560,5589880," Yeah, there's Pokemon Scarlet,"
5589880,5590760," Pokemon Violet,"
5590760,5591800," new games that came out."
5591800,5592680," And there's clips."
5592680,5594360," If you go to the Muda Horror,"
5594360,5596920," ordinary gamers, fantastic YouTube channel,"
5596920,5599400," if you go to his tweet"
5599400,5601000," and you watch this video,"
5601000,5603880," you can see it chug like crazy."
5603880,5604280," Can I do this?"
5604280,5605400," The format problems in this game"
5605400,5607320," are actually wild."
5607320,5608200," What do I press?"
5608200,5609320," Do I press the Linus?"
5609320,5610440," Do I press the Linus button?"
5610440,5611240," What do you want to do?"
5611240,5612360," I want to show my screen."
5612360,5614920," Make sure to show the laggy..."
5614920,5615720," I'm on Twitter."
5615720,5616840," I'm just on Twitter."
5616840,5617640," Oh gosh."
5617640,5618040," Okay."
5618840,5620040," Yeah, there's no bad things."
5620040,5621720," There are Linus laptop."
5621720,5622600," There it is."
5622600,5623080," Oh gosh."
5623080,5624680," Wait, they can see the chat."
5624680,5625560," Yeah, that's okay."
5625560,5627400," Now they know what everyone else is saying too."
5627400,5629160," They're going to argue with each other."
5629160,5629800," Oh no."
5629800,5631000," Sometimes they're really nice."
5631000,5632120," Sometimes they point to their house"
5632120,5633000," and they say nice things."
5633000,5633880," Witness the chomp."
5633880,5634440," But yeah."
5634440,5635400," When has that ever happened?"
5635400,5637880," Yeah, the chomp is really bad."
5637880,5641480," And you can see things popping in and popping out."
5641480,5642040," It's just..."
5642040,5642840," It's horrible."
5642840,5643160," And..."
5643160,5647880," I mean, okay."
5647880,5648520," So we saw it."
5648520,5649400," Now I can go back."
5649400,5651320," Cam only."
5651320,5653240," I can do this."
5653240,5654280," You're an expert."
5654280,5655400," I can do the Wanshow."
5655400,5663720," I have not played a Pokemon game since..."
5663720,5667640," Oh, what was it?"
5667640,5668760," What was the second one?"
5668760,5670680," I played Pokemon Yellow."
5670680,5672360," Little tidbit."
5672360,5672840," Okay."
5672840,5676120," I was the first kid in my grade six class"
5676120,5676920," with a..."
5676920,5680600," To bring my Game Boy Color and Pokemon Yellow game to school."
5680600,5683160," Everyone wanted to play."
5683160,5684840," People came up to me and they said,"
5684840,5686520," \"Hey, I'm a pretty good Pokemon trainer."
5686520,5688760," Let me train your Pokemon and I would give it to them.\""
5688760,5691880," And then they'd play and give it back to me."
5691880,5693320," And I'd be up a few levels."
5693320,5693640," It's like..."
5693640,5695640," I was king of the castle."
5695640,5695960," For real?"
5695960,5698440," That's kind of cool."
5698440,5699240," That's kind of cool."
5699240,5699800," But..."
5699800,5700280," That is..."
5700280,5703400," I think that's still in the red and blue era."
5703400,5703720," Yeah."
5703720,5704920," Yellow just has Pikachu."
5704920,5705720," It was red and blue."
5705720,5706040," Yeah."
5706040,5707480," Yellow was basically red and blue,"
5707480,5710120," but you had Pikachu and there were a couple of other subtle things too."
5710120,5711960," But it was the same game basically."
5711960,5713160," And then I played the next one."
5713160,5714040," It's the green."
5714040,5714920," Which is the..."
5714920,5715800," I forget what it's called."
5715800,5716680," But the one after that."
5716680,5718120," And then that's the last one I played."
5718120,5718600," I don't remember."
5718600,5719880," Yeah."
5719880,5722120," So I don't have any context."
5722120,5724360," The problem here lies with Game Freak."
5724360,5726520," It's development problems."
5726520,5729640," There are like, sure."
5729640,5729960," Okay."
5729960,5731480," The performance on the Switch is anemic."
5731480,5733480," That is totally, absolutely legit."
5733480,5735400," The Switch at this point is quite old."
5735400,5739640," I was still making review videos for Linus Tech Tips when the Switch came out."
5739640,5741720," In a hot minute."
5741720,5741960," Yeah."
5741960,5743000," What is it running out of video?"
5743000,5744120," I'm a second one right now."
5744120,5744520," Like..."
5744520,5746520," You can remember what that is."
5746520,5748040," Like from the Shield tablet."
5748040,5748520," Like..."
5748520,5749000," Yeah."
5749000,5751480," Like it's a problem."
5751480,5753400," We need an updated Switch for sure."
5753400,5755320," 100% agree with that."
5755320,5758360," It was so crazy when they released the OLED version and it just had the..."
5758360,5760600," It was the same internals."
5760600,5761880," It's like what?"
5761880,5762120," Yeah."
5762120,5762600," Yeah."
5762600,5763160," Yeah."
5763160,5763960," Like, come on."
5763960,5765160," Because it wouldn't be that hard either."
5765160,5766520," It's just like it's an arm processor."
5766520,5767240," It's like the new Switch, right?"
5767240,5767800," What's that?"
5767800,5770280," Call it the new Switch or whatever."
5770280,5772280," Like, do you do your crappy Nintendo naming?"
5772280,5772920," No one cares."
5772920,5774200," Just make it a little bit better."
5774200,5778520," But I completely agree with Moonar's take of emulating it"
5778520,5783400," running with the 60fps patch because it is despicable the state that this game was released in."
5783400,5787240," Because it looks not good."
5787240,5789640," Even when it's not like..."
5789640,5790520," Some games are good."
5790520,5791640," It looks like junk."
5791640,5792040," This one."
5792040,5794440," And then it also lags like crazy."
5794440,5794840," Like, what?"
5794840,5796440," What is this?"
5796440,5796840," Oh yeah."
5796840,5802680," Someone points out the Tegra X1 chip is the chip and it was running at half the clock speed of the shield apparently."
5802680,5804360," I can't verify that but..."
5804360,5808280," I mean, they had to make some concessions, right?"
5808280,5808920," Because it's like..."
5808920,5810040," You know..."
5810040,5811160," Oh wow."
5811160,5813080," It was so frustrating to me too, man."
5813080,5819160," I got a taste of like the steam deck and stuff before all of these handhelds came out."
5819160,5823240," Because I did the video on LTT about running Android on the Switch"
5823240,5829160," before they modded out the exploit with the patch."
5829160,5831000," And that was awesome, man."
5831000,5833800," Like streaming cloud games and stuff on the Switch."
5833800,5834920," PC games."
5834920,5836280," Anyways..."
5836280,5841160," Yeah, like Conrad says in full-plane chat, best way to play the Switch is to not."
5841160,5844840," And honestly at this point, that's true because the best way to play Switch is to emulate it."
5844840,5845320," Right."
5845320,5847320," Which is on any of the other things that you have."
5847320,5847880," Which is wild."
5848440,5850360," So Game Freak figured it out."
5850360,5854040," A lot of people pointed out that the release cadence might be too aggressive."
5854040,5854440," Right."
5854440,5855000," I don't care."
5855000,5855880," Okay."
5855880,5859320," Either start releasing games, start releasing games less frequently."
5859320,5859880," Right."
5859880,5861960," Stop cash-cowing Pokemon so hard."
5861960,5867240," Or hire more people and start doing a rotating thing where one team works on a game for like"
5867240,5869960," three years and you have two other teams."
5869960,5873880," So they're dropping games in series or whatever."
5873880,5874200," Yeah."
5874760,5881400," But this is ridiculous and people should not financially reward this level of effort."
5881400,5881720," Yeah."
5881720,5884440," I heard people saying that, you know, it's like, okay, you can't blame them."
5884440,5885480," They only have a year to do it."
5885480,5887320," So then it's like, okay, well..."
5887320,5888280," Absolutely blame them."
5888280,5893480," If we say that that's the cause, then it's either the fact that like,"
5893480,5895320," I don't know, I don't know who makes the final decision."
5895320,5899080," It's probably higher-ups at Nintendo wanting to like pump out Pokemon games."
5899080,5901320," So, you know, Pokemon's a bad guy."
5901320,5902840," Game Freak can..."
5903720,5905640," I wouldn't blame game Freak."
5905640,5906680," They'd figured out basically."
5906680,5907000," Yeah."
5907000,5912840," I'm not being like, hey, you individual developer that worked on the popping in of the graphics."
5912840,5913720," You're a bad person."
5913720,5915560," That's what I thought you were saying to me."
5915560,5921160," They need to come up with a solution, a business solution to this."
5921160,5924200," They need to do their release last game so they have more time to work on them."
5924200,5929000," Or they need to hire more people, expand the teams and make it dedicated teams per game"
5929000,5930760," and then make it so they're rolling."
5930760,5933640," So you have one team release a game every like three years,"
5933640,5936040," have three different teams, blah, blah, blah, do something like that."
5936040,5940360," I don't prefer that system, but if they're really dedicating to this level of release cadence,"
5940360,5941720," then they need to do something like that."
5941720,5942680," Okay."
5942680,5943160," Anyways."
5943160,5943800," Let's move on."
5943800,5944280," Enough about the one."
5944280,5948520," I don't know what the..."
5948520,5949640," Should we do another topic?"
5949640,5950920," Is that what you do?"
5950920,5952040," You've already done sponsors."
5952040,5954760," So from here, it's just whatever we..."
5954760,5955400," We're free."
5955400,5956040," We're free."
5956040,5956760," Did you cover..."
5956760,5957640," We got merge messages."
5957640,5958120," Oh, sure."
5958120,5958600," We got sponsored."
5958600,5959160," That's it."
5959160,5960360," We're sorry and we got topics."
5960360,5964200," Line has showed me where the merge messages are, but now they've escaped me."
5964200,5965080," Oh, there they are."
5965080,5965480," Hello."
5965480,5966360," We're letting those..."
5966360,5968360," We're letting them chill."
5968360,5969880," They have to steep."
5969880,5970280," They have to..."
5970280,5972600," What do you call it?"
5972600,5974120," Marinating."
5974120,5974280," No."
5974280,5975800," For mint."
5975800,5977480," They have to ferment a little bit."
5977480,5978040," Okay."
5978040,5978280," Yeah."
5978280,5979000," And then the final..."
5979000,5983160," You send in a merge message and you think it's pretty good,"
5983160,5986120," but you don't even know how good it's going to be by the time we get to it."
5986120,5986920," It'll be even better."
5986920,5987480," Yeah."
5987480,5988200," Yes."
5988200,5990360," These are properly aged merge messages."
5990360,5990440," Okay."
5990440,5992120," Which one of these did you have thoughts about?"
5992120,5996760," I don't think you guys talked about the Doom Eternal soundtrack thing, right?"
5996760,5999560," Because Linus asked me to put that in there, but I..."
5999560,6002200," I, Anthony, filled it out so I don't..."
6002200,6003720," I still don't know what's going on with that."
6003720,6007960," So I think it's probably best to leave that to next week if Linus still wants to talk about it."
6007960,6009560," Unless you know everything about it."
6009560,6011640," I know some things about it."
6011640,6013720," This amount of notes is actually crazy."
6013720,6015240," I have a large monitor."
6015240,6016360," It does not fit on the monitor."
6016360,6018440," Anthony does not screw around."
6018440,6019720," He doesn't."
6019720,6020920," He dives in."
6020920,6021480," I like it."
6021480,6023320," But yeah, I think..."
6023320,6024680," I'm just going to start reading through this."
6024680,6025560," I know some of this."
6025560,6028840," I'm going to have opinions along the way, but based on the amount of notes here,"
6028840,6030760," I honestly don't think I know all of this."
6030760,6033480," Anthony says I did my best to cut this down,"
6033480,6034840," but this is a messy one."
6034840,6035960," That's totally legit."
6035960,6039400," Honestly, this being this long, very likely makes a lot of sense."
6039400,6041720," And he intros it with bolded letters,"
6041720,6043000," which we don't normally do."
6043000,6043560," That's important."
6043560,6045640," Don't go after anyone."
6045640,6048760," This is not an encouragement to harass anyone or anything."
6048760,6050040," Don't do it."
6050040,6051320," Please."
6051320,6051880," Don't do it."
6051880,6053160," Every single time that people say this,"
6053160,6055480," and then people are like, \"Oh, it's a coded message to do it.\""
6055480,6056760," And then they do it anyways."
6056760,6058600," They screw it with everything and they make it worse."
6058600,6060200," And it's really freaking annoying."
6060200,6060760," So stop."
6060760,6063320," Oh, go ahead, anyone."
6063320,6063800," Seriously."
6063800,6064280," Let..."
6064280,6065080," There is proper..."
6065080,6066760," I believe there's..."
6066760,6067400," We'll see."
6067400,6069800," I think there's legal process happening with this right now."
6069800,6072360," Yeah, I mean..."
6072360,6073080," Let that..."
6073080,6073560," Let that go."
6073560,6074040," It scores."
6074040,6075240," Yeah."
6075240,6075720," We'll see."
6075720,6077080," Anyways, you go ahead."
6077080,6080120," You know, maternal's much anticipated soundtrack was released"
6080120,6084040," to little acclaim in 2020 when it was discovered that the quality"
6084040,6087160," of the mixes were incredibly subpar."
6087160,6090520," Some of the many issues include cuts between songs and sections,"
6090520,6094840," sometimes with overlap, but no fade, causing clicks and pops,"
6094840,6097480," tempo changes, and just various gaps."
6097480,6101720," Outcry surrounding this led to Mick disowning the OST,"
6101720,6105160," according to Doom Eternal executive producer Marty Stratton,"
6105160,6108440," on the r/Doom subreddit shortly after release."
6108440,6109880," I will add some context here."
6109880,6114520," The soundtrack for Doom not Eternal, like the previous one,"
6114520,6115400," was amazing."
6115400,6116760," Fantastic."
6116760,6118440," And I believe it was made by the same person."
6118440,6119640," Interesting."
6119640,6120680," Moving forward."
6120680,6123480," In his lengthy post, this being Marty Stratton,"
6123480,6127960," he defended ID software, ID software,"
6127960,6130520," and sound designer Chad Mossholder."
6130520,6133240," The main issue with the OST itself,"
6133240,6137160," according to Stratton, was that ID didn't have the original files"
6137160,6140680," to mix with, leaving only the in-game files to splice together."
6140680,6144600," It's further claimed that Mick delivered less music than expected"
6144600,6148440," in time for the OST's release, necessitating these splices."
6148440,6152360," Mick was said to have supervised Chad on a backup OST"
6152360,6154680," and signed off on a combined work."
6154680,6157960," Marty says that ID did absolutely nothing to prevent Mick"
6157960,6162760," from delivering on his commitments within the time frame he asked for."
6163080,6165560," \"The harassment faced by ID,\" he said,"
6165560,6169560," \"was a result of comments made by Mick who had since done,\""
6169560,6172920," quote-unquote, \"nothing to change the conversation.\""
6172920,6174200," This is a lot of names."
6174200,6175240," Good luck following it."
6175240,6178040," The ultimate ending of this is going to be,"
6178040,6180040," if you're interested, you're going to have to dive into it yourself."
6180040,6180360," Yeah."
6180360,6182440," Mick and Nick."
6182440,6184680," There's a Mick and a Nick."
6184680,6185480," Oh my gosh."
6185480,6186280," I think so."
6186280,6186920," Am I wrong?"
6186920,6187400," And id?"
6187400,6189240," No, it's Mick and Marty."
6189240,6189720," Oh, Marty."
6189720,6189960," Yeah."
6189960,6189960," Yeah."
6189960,6189960," Yeah."
6189960,6191880," We'll start with M, which I think is going to get-"
6191880,6192520," Mick and Marty."
6192520,6193160," But anyways."
6193160,6197640," At the end of all this, maybe they'll still open a pastor shop together."
6197640,6199560," A pastor shop."
6199560,6199800," Good night, thank you."
6199800,6201800," You don't eat there."
6201800,6203960," You just go and buy pasta and take it home."
6203960,6204200," Okay."
6204200,6205240," Continue."
6205240,6208040," No sauce."
6208040,6213240," Very recently, Mick Gordon posted a very long, very detailed rebuttal."
6213240,6217640," In the post, prompted by damage to his professional reputation,"
6217640,6221000," Mick provides evidence that highlights the extreme crunch"
6221000,6222200," he was expected to work through."
6222200,6226120," Being asked to write music before areas of the game was created,"
6226120,6230040," often resulting in music that did not fit and had to be remade,"
6230040,6233560," having the OST announced while no contract was in place to produce it,"
6233560,6236840," expectation of a new track every two weeks,"
6236840,6239480," regardless of whether previous tracks had been rejected"
6239480,6241720," or had to be redone due to changes in design."
6241720,6242600," That's a huge issue."
6242600,6248680," An extreme push to meet the original November 2022, 2019 release date,"
6248680,6252360," threats of lawsuits during arguments over contractual demands"
6252360,6257240," and not being paid for 11 months while this was happening."
6257240,6258440," Whoa, the heck?"
6258440,6259960," I didn't know that part."
6259960,6266840," For the OST, Mick says his interaction with Chad was minimal,"
6266840,6269560," and he never heard the final product before release."
6269560,6275240," Metadata provided by Chad showed the OST was being made without him"
6275240,6279720," or six months before he was contracted to do it after it was delayed."
6279720,6285960," But without him as in, I think, Mick?"
6285960,6288280," I don't know."
6288280,6293400," According to Mick, it definitely did have the original source files,"
6293400,6294840," but they didn't mix them properly."
6294840,6303080," When it did release, meaning the game, I think several demo tracks were rejected"
6303080,6304440," and thus not paid for."
6304440,6312280," Several demo tracks that were rejected and thus were not paid for because they were rejected"
6312280,6314840," were included in the OST, which is not cool."
6314840,6320200," Mick says that if he had acted the way Marty says,"
6320200,6323480," Bethesda would have had the right to not pay him,"
6323480,6327560," but they did, including an on-time bonus."
6329240,6333800," Mick suggests that the real reason the OST was rushed was because of legal issues surrounding"
6333800,6336360," pre-order bonuses and consumer protection laws."
6336360,6343800," Prior to Marty's post, Mick says that Marty had instructed him to not only rap."
6343800,6346200," Hello?"
6346200,6347880," I can't follow this."
6347880,6350280," There's too many names."
6350280,6354120," I don't know if I'm just brain fog from being sick, but I'm reading this out myself."
6354120,6354520," I know."
6354520,6355800," Honestly, as Marty, okay."
6355800,6357560," Marty, Marty, Chad, Marty, Mick, Mark."
6357560,6359080," Oh,"
6359080,6361080," Twitter?"
6361080,6361320," Okay."
6361320,6367400," Anyways, there's a lot of, he said she said,"
6367400,6372840," moral of the story is don't do or request contract work without a rock solid contract."
6372840,6373320," There we go."
6373320,6375960," Conquered employees and always key proceeds."
6375960,6377880," This is, these are good points."
6377880,6379960," It's a discussion question."
6379960,6382040," We've heard of Crunch in the games industry before."
6382040,6383640," We were literally talking about it before the stream,"
6384200,6386920," but mostly in respect to employees, not contractors."
6386920,6387240," Oh."
6387240,6389400," How much of this is a, I don't know if that's true."
6389400,6390600," It's definitely both always."
6390600,6396840," How much of this is a systemic problem and how much of this is due to the dynamic"
6396840,6398600," of management versus contractor?"
6398600,6399800," I think it's absolutely both."
6399800,6405320," How many interactions like this happen that aren't high profile and never get properly resolved"
6405320,6406760," and who gets the short end of the stick?"
6406760,6408600," That's a lot of discussion."
6408600,6413320," I will say that like, you know, one of the only things that I think I can say about this"
6413320,6418600," is I think in the games industry particularly, there seems to be a problem with"
6418600,6427080," having a lot of this type of conflict happen in the background and it only really comes out."
6427080,6435720," When there's like a big giant online fiasco about it, I feel like when it comes to other"
6435720,6443160," industries, maybe like movies, this stuff is more likely to emerge as people are kind of like"
6443160,6447720," talking about it in the open a little bit more, but with this, it's like, oh, we found out after"
6447720,6452600," the fact that all of these employees from these game studios have been completely,"
6452600,6457000," I mean, I will say that like when it comes to like visual effects and other things,"
6457000,6461080," like there have been similar, you know, scandals in other industries."
6461080,6465000," It just seems that like, it seems that this is a gut feeling that in the games industry,"
6465000,6469480," it seems like the stuff seems to be swept under the rug a bit more, which is not good."
6470760,6475080," Yeah, I think a lot of people just swallow the pill that they're working in the games industry,"
6475080,6479800," so they'll deal with it. Right, because there's this belief in crunch, it's like a cultural thing"
6479800,6489320," almost, depending now whether it's it's changing, but it's also a very difficult thing because games"
6489320,6495960," are often not always, obviously, but games are often, especially this one, I would include in there"
6495960,6501320," very complicated systems that have to be worked on by a huge variety of teams."
6501320,6505720," And those teams are going to have different delays, and then the ability for other teams to be"
6505720,6512440," able to progress in their work is going to lean on a different team achieving their goal."
6512440,6518200," So if team A has a delay, that delays team B's ability to work on something, so a lot of these"
6518200,6522840," delays will cascade into even more delays, and it becomes software development is already"
6523560,6529400," a situation where it's it's not impossible to make accurate timeline estimations of how long"
6529400,6535000," it's going to take you to do something. You can make very educated guesses, then you can run into"
6535000,6539960," problems that there was no way you could have foreseen that can just wreck everything."
6539960,6542200," Right, some people are pointing. Oh, good."
6542200,6548280," There's also a huge chance for scope changes. This is a huge problem in the gaming industry."
6548920,6553880," Something will happen. Like, remember when battle royales just like blew up, and every game and"
6553880,6558520," development was like, oh, wait, we need a battle royale. Oh my goodness. That's a pretty major"
6558520,6568360," scope change, for example. But yeah, it can be it can be really rough. Also, gamers. Oh, yeah,"
6568360,6571480," not the greatest audience to have in this scenario. Yeah, I mean,"
6571480,6576840," they're gonna be pissed about crunch, but then if your game is late, you're the worst person on"
6576840,6582680," the planet. So it's like, ah, and I will say to validate what you're saying about Twitter earlier,"
6582680,6589640," like it definitely seems like, you know, gamers are online more so than, you know, fans of other"
6589640,6596360," entertainment mediums. You know, I don't think that you're getting like, you know, with movies"
6596360,6600360," and stuff, you have people like backlash, but like with games, it's like every little game"
6601000,6607160," that is able to have a Twitter account and post updates is liable to be swarmed by people who"
6607160,6612600," are unhappy with decisions they make, less so for like smaller movies and whatnot. So"
6612600,6621560," because they're very, very loud. They will complain about things very quickly and very intensely,"
6621560,6629560," but they absolutely refuse to vote with their wallet. They will review bomb things. I'll do"
6629560,6634280," all of the kind of stuff that one of my favorite things to see is where people will catch people"
6634280,6638520," in screenshots where they have review bombed something and then bought it afterwards."
6638520,6644360," So like, people who will be like, I will never buy this thing. And then you can see it's like"
6644360,6649320," in their account, but they clearly did buy it. It's like, that's gamers in my opinion,"
6649320,6653080," they will scream about something. They'll say it's the worst, most vile thing ever, and then"
6653080,6657560," they'll buy it and buy all the DLC and buy all the optional skins and spend every dollar they"
6657560,6663640," possibly can on the game. I will say that like, I'm on a movie podcast, so I feel the need,"
6663640,6669000," get, I empathize with the need to kind of like play what other people are playing and like,"
6669000,6673160," oh, this game just came out. Everyone's talking about it. I need to play it because I need to have"
6673160,6677400," a take so that I can post about it or talk about it on Discord or whatever. And like,"
6677400,6681320," you know, I don't want to have to avoid spoilers. There's all sorts of things. So I empathize with"
6681320,6684360," that thing because on a movie podcast, you got to keep up with what's going on. You got to watch"
6684360,6692040," them in the new movie. But at the same time, after having a kid, I have way less time to"
6692040,6700600," keep up with things. So I've never really been good at playing like the super new game, but even"
6700600,6706920," less so now. And I feel like if you allow yourself to kind of get rid of that need to like,"
6706920,6713240," play every game when it comes out so that you can be take part in the, in the, whatever you call it."
6713240,6720360," I mean, dog piling on people online. It's actually pretty cool. If you just kind of chill out and"
6720360,6725560," you're like, I can play some of these 300 games of my Steam library. I don't need to keep buying"
6725560,6732440," things, you know? Yeah. Minimalism. Yeah. Come on, guys. The other thing that I wanted to mention"
6732440,6738360," real quick is that people were posting in the chat tech unions. It's our unions in games is like,"
6738360,6743320," it's starting to change, but there's not a whole lot of worker protections because there's so"
6743320,6746600," much contract work and stuff. And we kind of alluded to that earlier. Anyways, that's all I wanted to"
6746600,6749800," say. That's what I was saying too, is like there was the discussion question, but like, we hear"
6749800,6753960," about it with employees, but not contractors. There's a huge amount of contractors in game"
6753960,6759720," development space. You probably don't realize they're not employees. But yeah, it's totally a pain."
6759720,6766440," Okay. Let's move on. You want to do your people make games? Yeah. So this was something that"
6767080,6773400," someone sent to Linus and Linus didn't really know what was going on with it. So he asked me to take"
6773400,6778520," a look and I am subscribed to people make games. I like them as a channel. They, you know, obviously"
6778520,6784040," tech longer is kind of a similar thing I'm trying to do where I want to do this type of deep dive"
6784040,6789720," investigation, but they made this video. They posted about a week ago, just over a week ago."
6789720,6796280," And they're finding that valves underage gambling problem. Do you remember that from like 2015,"
6796280,6801880," 2016? Absolutely. Yeah. It's basically as bad as it ever was. I mean, I don't want to say that"
6801880,6807240," because we don't have like exact numbers, but it's it's still a huge thing. I mean,"
6807240,6811080," here I'll start reading this stuff, I guess. A recent investigation by YouTube gaming"
6811080,6815240," journalist, people make games has uncovered the fact that the CS go skin gambling industry"
6815240,6820280," is continuing to get minors hooked on gambling despite the issue dominating headlines back in"
6820280,6828760," 2016. I'm just going to bring up their video here just so you can see it. Okay, real quick. And then"
6828760,6833800," you can you can go watch it because it's you know, it's 36 minutes long. It's a great video."
6833800,6843000," And now to go back to the thing. Remember, so, so streamers, Tom syndicate castle and Trevor"
6843000,6849160," T Martin Martin back in 2016 received multiple civil lawsuits for promoting the gambling site"
6849160,6854600," CS go lotto.com during their streams without disclosing that they were the sites owners."
6854600,6859160," They rigged the site so they could win top tier loot while streaming to their millions of followers,"
6859160,6864840," many of which were children. And similar cases happened with other streamers, a valve eventually"
6864840,6871880," threatened skin gambling websites with legal action unless they closed down and Twitch warned"
6871880,6878040," streamers not to stream those those websites, which I thought was interesting because they didn't do"
6878040,6882680," it because of like the moral reason or like the, you know, and because it's bad for minors, but"
6882680,6887240," because doing so would be breaking the terms of service of third parties, which is against"
6887240,6893000," Twitch's own terms of service. And there was a whole, were you around? Did you pay attention to"
6893000,6899800," the recent thing where Twitch banned unregulated gaming gambling but not actual gambling is still"
6899800,6904680," like totally fine on Twitch, which is like you can have a position on that. I'm not saying that"
6904680,6908760," like there should never, you know, I don't want to, I don't want to go hard on that, but"
6908760,6914760," it was just interesting that they, it seems like everyone's just kind of trying to pass the buck here."
6914760,6922120," Um, yeah. So then, uh, as so all these points are from people make games video, just, you know,"
6922120,6927320," if you want more information, definitely watch it in 2017, send to get slash team Martin got lost,"
6927320,6931560," got their lawsuits dismissed. And this is an interesting point. Their lawyer made the argument"
6931560,6937080," that using the site was basically just like using McDonald's monopoly or like playing"
6937080,6944760," monopoly at McDonald's, uh, where you can, because you can get a free lotto ticket if you ask. So if"
6944760,6948760," you, is that a Canadian thing? I was asking somebody the other day, do we, is McDonald's"
6948760,6953560," monopoly just in Canada? But they have, they have promotions. I mean, if it regardless,"
6953560,6957800," there's American McDonald's monopoly. Okay. All right. Sure. So you go to McDonald's,"
6957800,6964200," you can only buy, you can only obtain tickets to, to play the game, you know, which is essentially"
6964200,6972360," gambling more or less, uh, by buying McDonald's products and the way they get around it being"
6972360,6976840," quote unquote gambling, I guess, is because you can actually go up to the counter and say,"
6976840,6982120," I don't want to buy anything, but I want to play, uh, and they'll give you like two tickets or whatever"
6982120,6986760," and you can rip them. So you're not, I didn't know you could do that, but that makes sense. Yeah,"
6986760,6993480," because you don't have to put money down. You could, like it's a game. And if you buy products,"
6993480,6997960," you'll get more tickets, but you could just get tickets by not paying money. So that was like the"
6997960,7002600," legal, it was related to that argument, which is, uh, the way that they got the lawsuits dismissed,"
7002600,7008600," which is kind of crazy. Um, so most people kind of forgot about this whole issue and thought the"
7008600,7012840," issue had been resolved. I certainly did. I've, I thought that like, Oh yeah, the whole skin"
7012840,7017080," gambling thing. I, that was, that was way back. They figured that out, but people make games,"
7017080,7022360," points out that skin gambling sites are still thriving sites like CS go roll, CS go empire,"
7022360,7029240," CS go fast, CS go polygon and more millions of users each. Uh, so their video has a sobering section"
7029240,7034360," playing excerpts from a lot of interviews with players who said they got into it at like 13 and"
7034360,7040200," 14 years old. Uh, they bet and lost hundreds of dollars on skin bedding. And many describe the"
7040200,7045080," experience as a key reason for their gambling addiction. So I think that's, that's really where,"
7045080,7048920," you know, if you, if you're coming into this and you're like, it's, you know, it's just a game, like,"
7048920,7055800," you know, it's, it's not that, it's not that big of a deal. Yes. If you have the, you know,"
7055800,7061560," mental capability and emotional maturity to understand what you're doing and, and, and now you're"
7061560,7067080," getting into it, right? But for 13 and 14 year olds and whatever, they don't like, it's setting up"
7067080,7073880," these habits. And then they stay like they describe these people describe having modern day, they have"
7073880,7080200," issues with it now because they got so into it back then. And then like it, it, it, uh, forms these"
7080200,7085480," dopamine pathways. Someone pointed out, sorry, just before we keep going, uh, apparently,"
7085480,7091880," us used to have monopoly, uh, but it was rigged by the promo runners. Uh, I haven't had it in"
7091880,7096040," years. That's the only reason why I knew they had it because I watched this whole mini-documenter"
7096040,7101240," and how the FBI was involved with McDonald's monopoly because of all the corruption involved"
7101240,7105800," with it, which is so interesting. Yeah. And other people are pointing out that, um, gambling is"
7105800,7112120," already in game though, like in CSGO, you can pay money, get a loot box. You don't know what's in the"
7112120,7118040," box. You know, there's, there's loot boxes. Like it's, it's a common concept, but I mean, I guess,"
7118040,7124280," I'm not familiar enough with the like long history of loot boxes in games to know whether CSGO was"
7124280,7128360," like one of the first games with that. Do you, would you, can you speak to that?"
7128360,7137480," Luke, um, I, I, I suspect there was probably, I don't know. Yeah. But I suspect there was probably"
7137480,7141640," some form of gambling before loop boxes. Right. And I know, yeah, loot boxes was the first"
7141640,7146280," mainstream. Sure. And, and the, the accusation, one of the things they talked about in the video"
7146280,7151000," is the fact that when you open the loot box, it's like a little slot machine graphic. And there's"
7151000,7156280," all these skins and they all go and then slow down and you're like, get the feeling that,"
7156280,7161880," oh my gosh, I was so close to that high end one. Oh, I got to do it again. I'm so close that time."
7161880,7166680," But really that the result is decided before you open the box."
7166680,7173080," So yeah, that's basically where things are at these, these, these sites are thriving."
7173080,7180040," They're being used by children and adults, which is whatever. But the, the question they ask is,"
7180040,7185240," why doesn't Valve do anything about this? PMG's case is essentially that like they're,"
7185240,7191400," they're saying that it's Valve's job to stop this, uh, since it's their collectible system on steam"
7191400,7196600," that allows people to say, all right, you're going to, uh, you can earn some of these things"
7196600,7201640," through the game, but a lot of people are just going and buying them and then using that,"
7201640,7206360," you know, they're, they're taking the skin to the skin bedding site and gambling with that."
7207080,7212840," Um, analysts told people make games that is obvious how Valve profits from allowing skin"
7212840,7219640," gambling sites to thrive. Like casino chips, every skin is bought from the house. That's Valve."
7219640,7225320," But the only way to cash out is to sell your skins to third party sites, meaning Valve keeps"
7225320,7229000," every dime in a casino when you win a bunch of money. You take the chips back to the,"
7229000,7233960," to the house and you're like, Hey, okay, let's exchange this for money. So if you win a lot of"
7233960,7239240," stuff at a casino, this, the casino loses money or I mean, whatever, in that they have to give you"
7239240,7246600," the money directly. If you win a bunch of, of valuable skins in skin gambling, Valve isn't losing"
7246600,7250520," money if you want to like cash those out because you're going to go to a third party site and"
7250520,7254440," they're going to pay you for the skins thinking that they can take those skins and put those back"
7254440,7260360," into the ecosystem and get money from that. So Valve keeps all the money. Like, so they have a"
7261160,7266680," incentive to keep these going. I'm not saying that they know this and that they're doing this on purpose,"
7266680,7273960," but it doesn't look great. If they completely shut down these sites tomorrow, analysts sold"
7273960,7278920," people make games that the value of skins would tank. So that's all. And another reason for them"
7278920,7284040," not to do it. And the popularity of the sites keeps people using Valve's products. People still do"
7284040,7290120," like showing off their skins in game. So, you know, it's, it's, it's tough because there's a clear"
7290120,7295800," incentive for Valve to not do anything. But at the same time, it's like the last time that this kind"
7295800,7300440," of thing came to light, there was a huge backlash about it and made crazy headlines and everyone"
7300440,7305080," was talking about it. So, um, and like if people are like, ah, the skins can't be worth that much."
7305080,7313080," I've seen how skins, how much skins cost in games. Well, um, there is an AK, an AK-47 case"
7313080,7322120," hardened pattern number 661 that apparently just sold for over 400 grand."
7322120,7331560," USB. Wow. One skin for one gun. And might I say it looks ugly. Worth it. Because apparently,"
7331560,7335800," there's four stickers on it. It's not about how it looks. Luke, it's for the prestige."
7335800,7340360," It is. This has got to be the prestige because it is a but ugly skin."
7341480,7346840," It's like a fine skin, I guess. It looks normal. Okay. Well, now we, is it have a name? Can I look it up?"
7346840,7355480," Or stupid stickers on it. Just just look up a $400,000 CSGO AK. You'll find it. 400 K CSGO AK."
7355480,7360360," Dexterto. Sold by the Danish collector."
7360360,7366760," That's it. Is that it? Are we looking at it? Yeah, that's it."
7366760,7372760," All the stickers are on it. It looks stupid. I mean, I think it's kind of cute."
7372760,7378520," Oh, man. I don't know. I just, I don't, I just get it. I don't understand."
7378520,7384280," I get it from an exclusive wall. I don't get it at all. But I guess the value in it is the"
7384280,7389960," exclusivity because if I remember correctly, I think someone said it's like stat track. I don't"
7389960,7397640," remember. It's also in like a like new or whatever their naming is for as good condition as it can be."
7397640,7402200," And it's in a really rare pattern. And then the four stickers, I believe are rare or something."
7402200,7408200," But like, man, wow, I don't know. Wait, how about this one? Can I moment?"
7408200,7414840," Well, you can do that, can't you, Dan? You're trusting me with the, with the potential reveal of"
7414840,7420600," sense of information when you have control to? Yeah, I'm the dumb tech newsman. You can't give"
7420600,7425800," me control. This is a huge mistake. But you're your Linus now. I'm Linus now. Yeah, a lot of people"
7425800,7430040," are still confused about why I'm here. I don't touch it, but quick update. Linus had to go to"
7430040,7438680," an event. He's a high flying billionaire doing cool things like Bruce Wayne all the time. So"
7438680,7447560," you can't stick around. You know, he's going to see Luke. So the, yeah, I already covered the"
7447560,7451720," slot machine thing. So the discussion question I had for this was gaming started as a young person's"
7451720,7457880," game, but is now enjoyed by all ages. Whose responsibility is it to protect kids from gambling?"
7457880,7462280," Is it Valve? Is it their parents? Is it the government? Like who should we really be looking"
7462280,7467080," at here and being like, ah, you're at fault. Like obviously, Valve should do something about it."
7467080,7471320," Obviously, Valve, it would be nice if they did. But one of the points that they make in the video"
7471320,7476360," that I didn't really cover in this one is how Valve kind of takes sort of a hands off approach"
7476360,7481560," with a lot of things when it comes to moderation. Like we had that whole thing. It's totally new."
7481560,7486040," And I don't, I forget how long ago that was now, but originally they didn't have any,"
7486040,7493480," or they did have like porn games on Steam. And then they were like, they banned them. And then"
7493480,7497320," they're like, okay, just kidding. They're back a year later or something. Do you remember anything"
7497320,7502440," about that? Yeah, I don't remember all the details exactly, but I do remember that was a thing that"
7502440,7508040," happened. I think that's how tags came into existence, right? Oh, well, there you go. People"
7508040,7513000," could tag something is like not safe for work, essentially. And then you could bite a fault that"
7513000,7518760," tag is not shown to you. I think that's, I think that's came around at the same time. I could be"
7518760,7523560," wrong. People are pointing out that there is porn on Steam now. Yes. But like that was, that was a"
7523560,7528200," reason development because they were for a while there. They were like, it seemed like they honestly"
7528200,7531800," flip flopped a bunch of times because they were like, do we want to have heavy moderation? Should"
7531800,7536360," this be like for a family friendly type of situation? Or do we just kind of, is it just like a game's"
7536360,7540520," platform and anyone can put what they want on there within reason, you know? I think the main"
7540520,7544920," thing that they did was basically make it so that unless you're looking for it, you shouldn't find"
7544920,7550200," it. Right. And I think they largely succeeded. Accomplish that. Yeah. Because unless you,"
7550200,7559400," unless you tell them, like, I want to see these. Hello. Yes. Tell that bird to shut the hell up."
7559400,7564040," I just whistle at it. Wait, where's this? Where I have a swear bleep. I won't use it. I want to risk"
7564040,7568440," it. Yeah, don't line is as good at it, but I'm going to screw it up and then I'll get the whole"
7568440,7574360," channel demonetized. Yeah, it's, it's scary. The way that I talk normally, the way I talk off"
7574360,7582040," camera, we're in trouble. I do. If you ever played Assassin's Creed or Black Flag,"
7582040,7587480," I do the whistles that he does in that game, my birds. Oh, so you muted yourself and it"
7587480,7591080," distracting because it sounds like a bird chirp. So it's distracting. So they're like, huh,"
7591080,7597160," often, fair enough of what they're currently doing. You should, you should yell at them like,"
7597160,7603640," yeah, like, the yelling at them will accomplish just like nothing because they, they like loud"
7603640,7610520," noises. So if I yell at them, they'll be like, yeah, let's party. Yeah. They're not going to"
7610520,7617480," like interpret it as anger. Okay, so to come back to the, to the topic, I guess, and obviously,"
7617480,7622840," you know, people have pointed out in the, in the, in the chat, like, oh, you know, if parents are"
7622840,7628280," letting their kids have access to funds and stuff, then, you know, that's like, you know, no one,"
7628280,7634600," no one's to blame or whatever. And it's like, you know, not everyone's parents are, are great"
7634600,7639720," people, you know, like sometimes, or they're, or they're busy or they don't know. And, you know,"
7639720,7644360," like this is, this is a huge reason why this is such an issue is because parents kind of,"
7644360,7651560," you know, know about movie ratings and, you know, other things like that are designed to"
7651560,7658200," protect children from experiences that they're not ready for. And games is still like, even after"
7658200,7664840," so many years, games is still kind of like a black box to a lot of parents. And, you know, no matter"
7664840,7669480," what generation they're from, I obviously, obviously, things are progressing there, but"
7669480,7675560," it's still like, you know, a lot of, a lot of kids, a lot of parents don't don't, they just don't know."
7675560,7679400," So you can't, you can't say, oh, it's up to the parents to do it because"
7679400,7684680," someone think of the children, et cetera. You know what I mean?"
7684680,7689080," I do, I do think I would like to see more regulation from government about things like loot boxes and"
7689080,7696840," games. I think promoting gambling to a format that as much as you are saying, it is definitely"
7696840,7705080," an all ages thing now is definitely targeted, great in the kids direction, right, a lot of games,"
7705080,7709400," I mean, and then promoting gambling through the form of loot boxes with those games,"
7709400,7712840," and a form of gambling that ropes you in, right? Because you're always going to get like a"
7712840,7717720," least one for free. And I think a lot of those games will rig that first one that you get for"
7717720,7720200," free. So you win something kind of cool and then you want to do it more, right?"
7720200,7723000," Yeah. And they also go like, oh, good."
7723000,7729640," I'm just saying like, I just think it's, it's, and I would like to see it not be that."
7729640,7732200," What did you say there? What was that? See? I don't know."
7732200,7736040," Now I just want to know which one of the forbidden words?"
7736040,7739080," Yes. Avada Kedavra."
7739240,7745640," Yeah. Oh, I was going to say something else about it, but I forgot."
7745640,7752760," Oh, oh, at the end of the, at the end of the video, it's a great video. You should definitely"
7752760,7757880," go watch it. They talk to a, the video game attorney guy actually, I forget what his name is,"
7757880,7762280," but I think he's on YouTube as video game attorney. And he was talking about how some"
7762280,7767400," platforms, I don't think he wanted to say specifically whether it was Valve or not. So"
7767400,7771720," don't, I don't know if it's Valve. I think he was trying to refer to other platforms"
7771720,7774600," that have these kind of mechanics and how they will,"
7774600,7783400," they will manipulate drops so that if you, if they've detected through data collection,"
7783400,7788920," that you're someone who's more likely to spend money, they will limit the amount of"
7788920,7793800," things that you can earn in game because they know that you're going to pay for the good stuff."
7794600,7799640," But if you are someone who won't pay, who is less likely to pay, they'll give you better stuff,"
7799640,7807080," which is just, which is crazy. So again, I'm not saying that a specific platform does that,"
7807080,7811240," but this guy was indicating that at least some platforms that he knows of through,"
7811240,7815320," does this and he knows this by talking to the people involved in that. So,"
7815320,7820440," yeah, it's a crazy time out there. And yeah, I think I agree that we need some sort of,"
7821000,7825800," like I, I think that some jurisdictions, I think the UK had some sort of legislation about"
7825800,7832920," loop boxes being officially gambling. I'm not sure where that's at in North America, but I,"
7832920,7840040," it's kind of crazy that this video hasn't gotten more traction given how huge the issue was"
7840040,7846360," back in 2016. It was like dominating headlines. I remember I was, I was making net link to daily"
7846360,7852120," at that time at NCIX. And we talked about it a lot at that time. It was a big deal."
7852120,7857160," Yeah. And this time, these guys put out this video. And honestly, I didn't, I watched, I,"
7857160,7861720," I saw it pop up and I was like, okay, yeah, because I thought the issue, I didn't watch it"
7861720,7865720," initially until Linus was like, oh, this might be something for Wancho. And then I watched it,"
7865720,7868360," because I didn't, I was like, I thought it was over. I thought those were just going to be like a"
7868360,7873320," little update. I'm like, yeah, there's still people trading skins, but I didn't realize,"
7873320,7878120," I'm going to watch it because I haven't watched it yet, but I love the people make games channels."
7878120,7885880," They're fantastic. But I, people might just be tired of this topic and more busy watching"
7885880,7893720," the world burn in various ways. Indeed. Next and last topic, should we go over the disabling iOS"
7893720,7897960," anti tracking thing, or should we just hit merge messages? I can leave this up to you."
7897960,7903560," I can do the iOS anti tracking pretty quickly, I think. It's, it's not, it's not as complicated as"
7903560,7911720," maybe it looks. Wait, where did it go? I can't, there it is. Yeah, Anthony filled this out."
7911720,7920360," Basically, so basically the Apple released this anti tracking app tracking transparency feature"
7920360,7927320," in iOS 14.5. It's prompt that asks if users would like to allow the allow apps, like individual"
7927320,7931800," apps, it pops up. It asks you if you want to allow the app to track your activities across the"
7931800,7937480," internet and other companies apps. A massive 96% of US users opted out in the earliest days of the"
7937480,7942280," features released. And, you know, Facebook and Apple had a big fight about this. They,"
7942280,7946760," Facebook lost a bunch of money and Apple was like, you know, screw you because this is what we have"
7946760,7954840," to do to protect people's privacy. And it's becoming apparent that what Apple was doing was"
7954840,7962520," basically kind of making a play to be Google in the sense that they want to supercharge their own"
7962520,7966120," ad services. Now you guys have talked about this, I think a little bit before on the WAN show with"
7966120,7972040," various topics that have come up. But the key detail about this one is the fact that when you go"
7972040,7979560," to disable the settings in iOS that are meant to, where is it? I want to say the actual thing."
7982760,7987160," Disabled. I think one of them is personalized ads. And the other one is."
7987160,7988920," Suggestions. Do not try."
7988920,7989800," Device analytics."
7989800,8000040," Yeah, Anthony said the like a lot more technical way to describe it. But basically there are two"
8000040,8007880," toggles on your iPhone that you can go and toggle off. One says allow personalized ads. And you can"
8007880,8013720," say no I don't want personalized ads which is ostensibly saying that don't track me and don't"
8013720,8020120," collect my data. Just give me the generic ads which means you don't need my data. And then there's"
8020120,8023720," another one that says do not track and that's like involving sending a do not track request in"
8023720,8030280," like various other situations. And you can turn both of those off and these developers,"
8030280,8037320," app developers Tommy Misk and Talal Hajbakari who work together under the name Misk that's"
8037320,8041720," their development team revealed that Apple's app tracking current transparency."
8041720,8048120," When you turn these off, it still collects the data in Apple apps. So in non Apple apps,"
8048120,8053480," it will turn it or it will stop them from collecting data on you. But in Apple apps and not every"
8053480,8060840," Apple app, but a good many of them including the app store itself collects all kinds of information,"
8062360,8067640," profile IDs, hardware IDs and info, keyboard language metrics about apps viewed with time stamps"
8067640,8072440," and durations for viewing all actions taken within the apps including like you tapping on things and"
8072440,8077160," how long you're looking at things, a massive amount of data describing subscription status"
8077160,8084600," and installed apps. This is all collected and sent to Apple and it's used to well I don't know"
8084600,8088600," if they found that it's used to personalize the ads. I don't know if they can get that far but"
8088600,8092360," they know that it's being collected and sent to Apple. So like,"
8092360,8099480," I don't honestly there's a part of me that I'm like, is this as big of a deal? Because"
8099480,8104680," it's not like there's one part of me that's like this is kind of crazy. Apple is saying whatever"
8104680,8111720," happens on your iPhone stays in your iPhone and at the same time, it is a big deal because they"
8111720,8115880," put these buttons on your phone that don't do anything when it comes to Apple's own apps."
8117000,8121400," Aggressively misleading people about privacy is like super not okay. So I think it's a big deal."
8121400,8125960," Yeah. So like we made this the title story on tech link the other day and the original title I"
8125960,8129960," put on there was these buttons do nothing or these buttons don't work because they don't do"
8129960,8134600," anything. You can swap that. It's like, you know, when you open Facebook or whatever, the prompt will"
8134600,8139320," come up being like, do you want to Facebook to track you and you say no and that works in that"
8139320,8147720," app but in an Apple app, it doesn't do it anyways. So I mean, I think you guys looked into this and"
8147720,8154120," when you open an Apple app, you don't get the prompt. You can set it at a system. But it doesn't"
8154120,8159640," do anything. So anyways, discussion question, how can we trust anything any company says about"
8159640,8164760," respecting your privacy? Yeah. So like, that's kind of it's the same thing. You can't. We live in"
8164760,8170680," the current year and it's bad. It's bad news for privacy. Should companies making privacy claims"
8170680,8178440," be required to independently audit their practices? Yes. Yeah, but like, but they won't we won't."
8178440,8185800," If you look at the 2008 housing crisis, the independent auditing houses, I shouldn't say"
8185800,8193320," houses that context the independent auditing firms or whatever, we're all just playing the game."
8193320,8198840," Right. So they would just get paid by the companies that they were supposed to be auditing"
8198840,8203080," and just put stamps on things and be like, yep, looks good. Yeah. All the time because they were"
8203080,8206760," just making tons of money. That's just going to happen again. So like, yeah, that should probably"
8206760,8211560," happen. But it's just going to have endless amounts of corruption anyways. Did you ever,"
8211560,8216840," I have a question for you, Luke. Did you ever believe because I know that you care about"
8217960,8225000," stupid things like facts and evidence, but on previous when shows, it seems like you, you know,"
8225000,8231320," have wanted to kind of like, hey, let's say like, let's hold on. Let's only say things that"
8231320,8236040," we're absolutely confident of when it comes to Apple and privacy when this topic has come up before."
8236040,8241960," Did you have an actual? Did you have? Was it? Did any part of you actually believe that Apple"
8243400,8249480," actually was talking, walking the walk a little bit when it came to privacy? They say, we care"
8249480,8254600," about your privacy. Did you believe them a little bit? Not that there's no reason to believe them"
8254600,8259320," on anything anymore. I'm just saying. Yeah. Pre all of this, I did to a certain degree,"
8259320,8265400," I thought an iOS device was more secure. And I think it was at that time. When this landed,"
8265400,8273160," I had concerns. It didn't seem like they were 100% playing ball in the way that they wanted"
8273160,8278840," people to think they were. But I didn't have a particular reason to think that they weren't."
8278840,8284440," The opposite of shocked that this topic is in the dock and this is a thing."
8284440,8289560," That's what I didn't want to say it until it happens. Right. Right. Because I think you,"
8289560,8296280," I think there's a lot of danger there when you criticize things or people or corporations or"
8296280,8302600," whatever for something that you don't know is legit or potentially isn't legit. That makes"
8302600,8307000," it so that when you do want to criticize them for something that is legit, it adds question"
8307000,8311800," to your criticism. Right. So I always want to be careful about that."
8311800,8319560," Yeah. No, and I completely agree. I will say that in the absence of any hard evidence that"
8319560,8327160," Apple did anything differently, it seemed like they did care about privacy. And I think that"
8327160,8333320," it made business sense too to have that as a differentiating factor in a world where"
8333320,8337800," absolutely everyone is collecting everything about you that they can. Apple comes out here and is"
8337800,8345400," guess what? We don't have a huge ads business. We get all our money from hardware and software"
8345400,8351480," to a certain degree. But it's mostly iPhone sales, Mac sales, that's where they're making a lot of"
8351480,8356360," their money. And now it's services as well. They're selling subscription services and all this stuff."
8356360,8363160," But and that's huge. But it hasn't been like a data collection, you know, we're serving you ads"
8363160,8367560," and that's how we make money. That's been Google's thing. So I was willing to believe to a certain"
8367560,8373560," extent in the absence of evidence that Apple did care about or not, I want to say care about your"
8373560,8379880," privacy, but that they had chosen to not do this type of collection. But I was hoping that was the"
8379880,8387160," case. I just I wasn't 100% confident. I just I feel like the place that I find this to be the most"
8387160,8393400," egregious is in the political realm. When you have people attacking people that they don't agree with"
8393400,8401560," politically for like, like physical features or aesthetic reasons, like I don't like this person's"
8402360,8412200," hair or the way they dress or something like that. Not only does it usually just bolster and steal"
8412200,8417400," the resolve of the other side, because they're like, that's a stupid reason to attack my person."
8417400,8422680," But it's not accomplishing anything. And it makes all your other accusations just seem"
8422680,8430360," lame. So like, you're not you're not helping anything by throwing these these criticisms out"
8430360,8435160," there that don't actually matter. So I try to keep it try to keep it legit. But with that,"
8435160,8439240," speaking of legit, yes, first messages time, let's do it."
8439240,8440040," In merge messages."
8440040,8445320," You're going to read them. Do I mean to read them? Why don't you read them, Luke?"
8445320,8449560," You read them. Yeah. I could barely see them. So maybe it's better if you do read them."
8449560,8456200," We'll start with this one for you though, Luke. I look what's your opinion on external GPUs."
8456200,8462040," I personally use a Mac Studio M1 Ultra for Blender with no external GPU. Do you think they're worth it?"
8462040,8469080," Using it for Blender, so it's very, very likely a professional"
8469080,8476040," reason why you're doing it. So it might be a good idea to grab one. External GPUs are very neat"
8476040,8483960," and very problem prone in my experience. Their failure rates seem they feel high to me."
8484520,8491160," So I don't know. I've tried to stay away from them pretty much as much as I can."
8491160,8497400," And that's been pretty easy because I haven't had a lot of use cases why I would need one."
8497400,8502600," I've used them multiple times and they've been kind of a pain every time. But when I used to do"
8502600,8508760," that was in the infancy of external GPUs. So that kind of makes sense. One time that I used one more"
8508760,8515880," recently was with an Asus laptop that Linus had at his house and it was flawless. So"
8515880,8521000," I don't know. That was an external GPU that was made specifically for that laptop."
8521000,8528760," Like a power upgrade kind of situation. Maybe that helped it. Someone in Flowplane Chat said"
8528760,8535640," you can't do eGPU on M1. So maybe get wrecked. Yeah."
8535640,8538840," Wow. Okay. For again."
8538840,8545160," For them. I mean I've got another question here on a similar vein. This guy also uses Blender."
8545160,8550040," Cycles. That work type is dominated by NVIDIA. Within video prices climbing to the moon."
8550040,8555400," Do you think our DNA three may be price competitive in this work type? Will AMD ever catch NVIDIA?"
8555400,8563160," I have no idea. Hopefully. I mean I can't say how it's going to perform before the thing comes out."
8564040,8567800," But hopefully labs test that type of use case."
8567800,8573800," Yeah. A lot of it's the proprietary CUDA stuff that NVIDIA just holds."
8573800,8576520," That is a big problem. Yeah."
8576520,8582440," This one's from Rees. Hey guys. Do you have any takes on ID security? Australia has gone through a"
8582440,8588680," load of hacks on big businesses recently. Lots of data on the internet. Two out of five of every"
8588680,8598200," Aussie personal data went online via health insurance. Yeah. I find it very entertaining that the"
8598200,8607160," places the things that I use that have the worst security are government services and banking services."
8607160,8616200," Which is just crazy. Yeah. I can attest to that as well. I'm like"
8617400,8622840," it's wild to me that those type of services in my experience don't have."
8622840,8632600," Like if they do have two factor it's just SMS. Yeah. And I'm like can we get this together here?"
8632600,8638920," Come on guys. A lot of banks and government services are often"
