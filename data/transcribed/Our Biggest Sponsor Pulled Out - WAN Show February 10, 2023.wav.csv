0,10000," What is up everyone? Welcome to the WAN Show. We've got a great show lined up for you guys"
10000,15440," today. Well, we're going to make it great. We've got a few topics. First of all, begun"
15440,24040," the Chadbot Wars have. Yeah. Oh, this is hilarious. Okay. So from the WAN Show writer, I have"
24040,29200," logged into Bing on your computers. Feel free to access it and ask a few discussion"
29200,35760," questions slash make a few searches. And what's great is that if it's good, I win a thousand"
35760,41960," dollars from popular streamer XQC. If it's good. Yeah. Who, who's collab? I will be talking"
41960,45000," about a little bit on the show. That's one of our topics for today. What else we got today?"
45000,54280," Okay. Yeah, that's right. I took the only interesting one. Samsung says shut up about"
54280,59200," our garbage filled phones. Don't talk about it. Okay. And we have one because we're going"
59200,66360," to look into it. Also, uh, whoo, Elle D merge spotted in the wild. That topic is actually"
66360,73880," hilarious. I don't want to spoil it though. Should I spoil it? Yeah. So apparently, a,"
73880,80360," a, someone went home with somebody in order to do the business. And that person that they"
80360,85280," went home with happened to be wearing Linus tech tips underwear. And they posted on,"
85280,90480," I don't know what this is. Uh, Reddit. Is it Reddit? I'm not sure. I don't know. You"
90480,94360," know what? We'll get into it more later. Facebook or something. And they said, for now,"
94360,99320," help for now. Here's the thing. What? Why you guys thinking about it? Okay. You take"
99320,125200," someone home. They're wearing LTT underwear. What would you do? Yeah. Show is brought"
125200,132680," to today by Thoram, the rich and square space. I want to make a slight edit to that question"
132680,137080," because I think asking our audience what they would do if they went home with someone that"
137080,140800," happened. No, that's what I want to know. Okay. That's what I want to know. I just want"
140800,146000," nothing but positivity. It's been a long week, Luke. Fair enough. Let me tell you something."
146000,149520," Yeah, screw it. I'm not going to put in my question. I had three days this week where"
149520,154760," I didn't go to work, but they were the hardest that I've worked in the last six months because"
154760,162440," I took three kids to Disneyland and fixed XQC's computer on like three day total round trip"
162440,170840," turnaround. Okay. It was very challenging. Many steps were walked. Okay. And the computer"
170840,175720," was fixed. Why don't we jump right into our first topic? What the devil is the headline"
175720,181280," topic? I forget what the title of the stream is even. Sponsor, sponsor, sponsor, sponsor,"
181280,188520," bailed. Our sponsor bailed. Yeah. Isn't that the headline? Our sponsor bailed. Oh, that's"
188520,195640," right. One of our one of our biggest sponsors for the last two years bailed on their biggest"
195640,202720," project. It was his idea for the time. I forgot. Between telling you that and us talking now,"
202720,209120," I've filmed like two videos on the videos. I'm sorry. I'm trying. Fair enough. Fair enough."
209120,215760," Okay. Intel extreme tech upgrade is over. It's done. Finito. Yeah. Cuplet. Yeah. Done."
215760,220080," So, yeah. You're never getting one. Never. I mean, I don't think you were eligible anyway"
220080,225280," as like top management, but like well, Ed got one. Ed got one. Yeah. How the hell did Ed get"
225280,229920," one? Yeah. So I think I think I technically was fair then. Yeah. So maybe you're ineligible"
229920,232280," because you work for a different company. I don't know. I'll find somebody to make you"
232280,235880," get computers anyway. You don't need one. I'd actually don't forget it. Forget it. Forget"
235880,244320," it. The point is Intel extreme tech upgrade is over. We did 24 episodes, which hilariously"
244320,250000," at the time that we booked Intel extreme tech upgrade two years ago. I was like, yeah, we're"
250000,254880," totally going to make our way through like everyone in the company. But the rate at which"
254880,260800," our employee count has grown. But hiring more people that has been spitting out. Paste how"
260800,264600," fast we can make these videos. There are a ton of work, right? Because you got to do"
264600,269560," all the procurement. Everyone's kind of, this is their chance to like talk to you guys,"
269560,274360," right? So everyone's looking for not a gimmick. It's something that expresses who they are."
274360,278520," But a unique element, right? Yeah. Yeah. And so in the early ones, it was pretty simple."
278520,284120," I'm going to be a game streamer. Gaming. Right. Now it's gotten a little bit more complicated."
284120,287720," It's like, oh, I'm not going to make a little bit more interesting. Exactly, right? But"
287720,295400," now it's done. It's done. What is this? Guess how many views? Oh, we did 24 episodes of them."
295400,300280," Guess how many views across all episodes? You can't look before reading this. Guess, then"
300280,306280," scroll to the readout super chats end of show section, Colton. Now I know Intel extreme tech"
306280,313160," upgrade was a massive performer for us. It was honestly probably the best idea that I have ever"
313160,318600," had in the entire history of this company. I think outside of potentially scrapyard wars,"
318600,323560," I think I've seen people call it out as an individual piece of content that we do more than"
323560,331000," anything. It's what I call a win, win, win, win. Yeah. Absolutely. Everybody wins. Yeah. The"
331000,335880," sponsor wins because particularly at the time they booked it, Intel didn't have a lot good to"
335880,341000," talk about. There wasn't a lot of positive sentiment. And with my like calling out the name of the,"
341720,346760," the reason why I brought that up is actually because they would always say Intel extreme"
346760,351560," rig update. They wouldn't just say like rig update or extreme rig update. Intel was at the"
351560,354840," beginning of the call out every single time. Do you know when I named the series?"
354840,362760," When I was standing on the stairs to Anthony's place for the first episode, it had a completely"
362760,369080," different name. And I was like, not stupid. Just brand it. We're going to call it extreme tech"
369080,374600," upgrade because it's like X T U, which is there overclocking software. I was like, he, he, that'll"
374600,377960," be funny. Okay, let's go with that. And if they don't like it, then there's always gotta be"
377960,382920," some, this is always his little acronyms. They always mean something. There's always something"
382920,386600," that the fastest possible doesn't mean anything. Oh, right. Over on tech. For about that one."
386600,393240," Yeah, that doesn't mean anything. No. Anywho. So we came up with extreme tech upgrade."
393240,401320," And it's a win, win, win, win. Okay. So the, who was it first? So the sponsor wins because it's just"
401320,406840," all good vibes. There's nothing but good vibes. It's, it's your tech in good vibes."
406840,413000," How can you go wrong? Yeah. Okay. We win because we get sponsored. It's sponsored content,"
413000,418680," which you guys probably understand pays way better than normal content. Oh, yeah. Right. But"
418680,423560," then here's the thing. If you can find sponsored content that the audience loves,"
423560,428600," the audience wins because they get a chance in content that otherwise wouldn't exist,"
428600,432920," right? To get to know all the different members of the team and see all these different approaches."
432920,440520," I mean, it has been just wild. How many messages I get with people talking about how like inspiring"
440520,446360," extreme tech upgrade was for people's setups, right? It's so cool. That makes sense. And I learned"
446360,453640," this kind of by accident, but the amount you learn about someone from how they would spend $5,000"
453640,461880," is unbelievable. Yeah. Like, okay, seriously, I would strongly recommend this. If you happen to"
461880,468680," just be like a casual high net worth individual, okay, first date, just give them $5,000 to spend"
468680,472680," and watch them. Okay. I bet you'll know if you want to spend the rest of your life with them."
475400,480040," There you go. No comment on that. No comment on that at all. Yeah, that wouldn't be weird,"
480040,485000," right? Wow. And then the fourth win, you're really setting yourself up serve some really"
485000,489800," interesting expectations. First of all, if you can afford that at all, but you're also communicating"
489800,497080," that you can easily afford this. So I hope you're like, and the fourth win is the staff. It's like,"
497080,503960," it's like sponsored content that also turns into people having sick set up, set home. Yeah,"
503960,508520," Linus found a way to flex some, flex some Mr. Beastie stuff, but he doesn't even have to pay for it."
508520,515720," It's, it's the best, it's the best deal I have ever negotiated ever. They're also genuinely really"
515720,519880," fun to watch. Yeah. Well, that's what I said. That's the win for the audience. Great. Jake's"
519880,525800," entire video. I've watched Dennis is twice. Yeah, it's just hilarious. I think I've seen most of"
525800,531000," them at this point and a pretty much every single one that I have clicked on, I've watched the whole"
531000,535400," way through because it's actually like consistently pretty interesting because you'll find whatever,"
535400,539640," you'll roast them for taking whatever from the office, which is that's another thing."
539640,546120," What they steal from the office is almost like a lot of people. Yeah. The whole thing is just like,"
546120,550680," I don't know. Do they go for stuff they think I won't notice? Do they just go for the obvious"
550680,555880," stuff? Do they just go straight for the high value? I don't know. How long has it been there?"
555880,562040," How long have they had it? Exactly. Yeah, I don't know. But guess what?"
562040,571160," Linus Media Group Incorporated happens to be a production juggernaut and as such, we were not"
571160,578200," going to simply allow a great thing like Intel Extreme Tech Upgrade to die simply because Intel,"
578200,582840," I mean, you know what? The reality of it is we love working with Intel. We've been working with"
582840,586600," them as long as we've existed almost. Do you remember the first time we worked with Intel?"
586600,590440," It was like three months in. Yeah. Was it one of those like commercial things that we did?"
590440,596680," Yeah. It was like promoting like a snowboard promo that they were doing with like 4770K or"
596680,601320," something like that or 6700K or it must have been 47 to, I don't know, it was a long time ago."
601320,606040," Definitely not 67. Yeah. It must have been 4770K. You got like a free snowboard or something. It might"
606040,611240," have even been an ivory bridge. Holy crap. Might have been 3000. Anyway, the point is that we did"
611240,619160," like these little in-video like pre-roll things. Massive shout out to Mike, you know, who you are,"
619160,624360," who got that whole thing, Kickstarter on Intel side because they had zero awareness at that time."
624360,629480," Like influencer, YouTube, what? Like nothing. They would go and they would blow six,"
629480,635160," seven figures on all kinds of wild stuff that as far as I could tell had essentially zero impact."
635160,639160," And then, you know, when I wanted like 500 bucks, they'd be like, sorry, who are you? I'm like,"
639160,644520," I don't know. Only like one of the biggest tech YouTubers, which I guess doesn't matter right now,"
644520,649640," but could someday, someday, I believe the loop. Actually, I didn't really believe much at that"
649640,654680," point. I was just trying. We believed a little bit. We wanted to believe it. We wanted to believe"
654680,661240," it. There is hope. That was pretty much all we had to go on. Yeah. Anyway, so we've been working"
661240,666600," with Intel almost as long as we've existed. And you know, like any relationship that lasts for 10"
666600,670920," years, things add, then they flow, you know, you know, things go. And we're still going to be working"
670920,675720," with them. But you know, whether it was changing priorities over there, whether they dropped the"
675720,679400," ball, whether well, no, we didn't drop the ball, we followed up, we gave them time. But whatever"
679400,686680," happened over there, they couldn't make it happen. And if you had to guess, if you had to guess,"
686680,694200," what company would find it pretty hilarious to kick in, tell while they're down and scoop"
694200,698280," extreme tech upgrade out from under them, who would it be?"
698280,704120," Arm kidding. Other other three letters. You've got one letter right."
704120,706760," Other three letters. Actually, you've got two letters right."
706760,713640," AMD. Let's go. I think, yeah, the whole chat already guessed. Yeah. AMD is coming."
713640,718520," It's not going to be called the same thing because that wouldn't be as as funny."
719240,724280," But streams like per their branding and like, yeah, yeah. So it's going to be called AMD"
724280,729240," Ultimate Tech Upgrade Auto. I have nothing to do with the naming this time. I take no"
729240,737960," responsibility for that. The first episode will be with Adam. Oh, really? Okay. The first episode"
737960,742920," is going to be with Adam from the writing team. And then my understanding is that there's going"
742920,749480," to be a very special second episode that is going to have none other than Yvonne as the subject."
749480,755960," Now, because she is my wife. How are you going to tell me? I can't get one. I'm not privy."
755960,762440," And Yvonne gets. So I can, I can explain this. I can explain this. This was a business decision."
762440,767080," This was a strategic decision made not by me. This was actually made by the business team"
767080,772280," because they really want to put a strong foot forward with these first couple and then lock down"
772760,781000," a longer term deal here because full disclosure guys, when you when you renegotiate a content deal,"
781000,787320," you never do it at the old price. So it's not cheaper. I can tell you guys that much."
787320,796120," Look, okay, I got a lab to build. I got a lab to build. Okay. And I think that people are asking,"
796120,800920," is it the same budget? I actually don't know the details. Someone suggested a budget of $6,900."
801000,811480," It's pretty good. Okay, done. $6,900 Canadian. Brilliant. $6,900 Canadian. Done."
811480,817640," I think I'm actually getting a discount. Was it USD before? Yeah. Oh wow. 5,000."
817640,827240," Yeah. So it's going to be awesome. I'm really looking forward to it. I have no idea what's coming,"
827240,831880," which is half the fun for me in the early ones. I was actually quite involved. I mean, not"
831880,836840," people like Anthony. Like I didn't need me to help him, right? But a lot of the early ones,"
836840,841400," I was quite involved ahead of time and sort of part selection and stuff like that. And then"
841400,845400," over time, procurement started to help. The rest of the writing team started to do a lot more of"
845400,851240," it. I think I was only really involved in the first couple. And now I kind of just walk in. I'm like,"
852200,856520," what's going on here? Yeah. What's what's Shake a Laker? Was that strap some speakers?"
856520,863160," Yeah. That's random stand. I found for you. Okay. That worked. That worked. I wasn't"
863160,868920," actually flaming it. You need to be there, by the way, when we finally do the episode reacting to"
868920,876040," Linus's old setups. Oh yeah. Have I shown you any of them? Like have you ever seen a bunch of them?"
876040,881320," Have you? Like, well, no, I mean, from before you knew like 12 years. Yeah, but I did most of my"
881320,888120," janky stuff before you met me. Okay, but I've seen the I'm trying to go from the green water"
888120,893160," cooling one that had the purple coil around it. Okay. Yeah. Seen that one. I've seen the chiller."
893160,896680," Okay. I definitely haven't seen all of them, but I've seen some is what I'm trying to say. You"
896680,902760," saw me some pictures. I've done some weird stuff. I'm trying to find something now, but you know"
902760,908440," that at one point in time, I had transferred my components over to a new case and the power button"
908440,914200," on the case didn't work. So my motherboard at the time had a power button on the motherboard."
914200,921480," So I rigged up an elastic band and pencil setup so that the side panel of the case,"
921480,925960," I got a hole in it and I had the pencil mounted in the hole and the elastic bands would hold it"
925960,930280," in place and you just press the eraser on the pencil and the pencil would go through and press"
930280,933960," the power button on the motherboard and that would be how you turn the computer on. It was sick."
936200,943000," Okay. I will see your eraser rubber band and raise you one surround speaker stand."
943000,951960," That's amazing. Yes. That is a brush wheel. That is a wheel. Well, that's just a wheel."
951960,957880," It's a wheel. Beautiful. Yeah. The base is a wheel. That was the inspiration for Jake's"
957880,964440," surround speaker mount was my setup from when I was about 15. That's amazing. So we're gonna,"
964440,969560," I'm gonna dig through all my old pictures. I'm gonna like pull out all the weird,"
969560,973720," janky stuff that I've done over the years and we're gonna do like a, like a, I mean,"
973720,980040," obviously I can't react to it. This all seems perfectly reasonable to me, but I feel like you"
980040,984680," guys are probably gonna have some stuff to say about it. I do feel like I should be involved with"
984680,989160," that, but I feel like I'm gonna agree with your decisions more. Because you remember like I mounted"
989160,995560," a, a water pump on a cut off piece of the old mud flap of my old car. Like, do you remember that?"
995560,1004440," Like I've, right now there's a graphics card laying on flat on top of my computer with a PCI"
1004440,1010760," riser cable coming out of the main component, or main area of my computer going out all the way up,"
1010760,1015320," connecting into the graphics card with a second power supply, not in the computer,"
1015320,1019400," on the outside of the computer running power cables up the back of the computer into the"
1019400,1024760," graphics card so that everything works because otherwise it wouldn't have fit. I enjoy the jank."
1024760,1028840," Okay, that's fine. I did not adopt the jank. I was born in the jank."
1028840,1037560," That's another really funny one to me. The amount of flack that I take, people accusing me of being"
1037560,1044920," a fan of this or a fan of that, particularly accusing me of being extremely anti-amd. Like,"
1044920,1050120," I hate AMD for some reason. People started with AMD system. This was my desktop wallpaper for,"
1050120,1059000," I kid you not years. I literally repped AMD on my desktop wallpaper. This is super sick wallpaper."
1059000,1065560," I forget where I got it, but apparently I still have it somewhere for actual years. So when I say"
1066120,1076280," AMD's product is bad. It's just because it's bad. It's not. Fortunately, they're not bad these days."
1076280,1082360," So AMD Ultimate Tech Upgrade is going to be a ton of fun. We're going to build some sick gaming"
1082360,1089560," rigs and maybe some other things. So there it is, guys. Oh, right. My computer is all red right now."
1089560,1094840," It's all AMD. Yeah, mine too. Yeah. Actually. Yeah. I mean, I've been threading for a while,"
1094840,1100920," but you were in until before. I was. Yeah. But then not now. I mean, for what I'm assuming is like"
1100920,1105960," a year and a half now. Yeah. I've been AMD processor. It's fine. It's been great. It's been great."
1105960,1112360," I mean, I do have some problems with like sleep states, but like realistically, that can happen"
1112360,1117000," on Team Blue as well. So I'm not going to, I'm not going to make too much fuss about that."
1117000,1123880," But because I had to, because I had to clear my CMOS for just like as a troubleshooting step for"
1123880,1134520," the AMD 30 day challenge, I a, banged up my my NVMe RAID settings. So that was really scary. And b,"
1134520,1142040," I ended up losing that setting that I had had to change to make it so that my system doesn't just"
1142040,1146760," randomly crash all the time. So there's like, there's an S3 sleep bug or something like that."
1146760,1151320," I have to disable all power saving states. Otherwise my computer, not when it's working,"
1151320,1156680," when it's idle, we'll just crash. Just like randomly crashed hard lock, full lock. It's very"
1156680,1161720," annoying. It's a thread ripper bug. And AMD has completely abandoned enthusiast thread ripper,"
1161720,1164120," even though they said they definitely, definitely wouldn't."
1164120,1171160," Goes to show, goes to show you I, I have no problem calling out sponsors, even new ones who"
1171160,1177400," just signed a big deal with us. Okay. So try to guess Intel Extreme Tech Upgrade is over 24"
1177400,1184520," episodes, total views. Yeah. So man, I have not paid attention to views on these. So I'm coming in"
1184520,1190920," extremely uneducated, but I'm going to throw my guess this, I feel like this might be high."
1190920,1195160," I'm going to throw my guess at 50 though. Because I feel like some performed like really, really well,"
1195160,1199320," Dennis's has like 6 million or something. Yeah, some of them just like smashed out of the park,"
1199320,1203240," but I have to assume some of the other ones didn't do as well. I'm going to say 70."
1203880,1208840," Because almost across the board, they have at least 2 million views. So that's 48."
1208840,1212760," Yeah, I haven't even looked. And then there's a handful. Like, I think Riley's has four or five"
1212760,1217560," million. Anthony's has at least three. Riley's was good. Riley's was great. Anthony's was good."
1217560,1222360," So many of these were so good. Yeah, I'm just remembering them because it's been a long time."
1222360,1227000," It's been two years. Yeah. So like, I can't remember them all off my head, but literally,"
1227000,1233800," I think the biggest W that I have ever double viewed. And this is one that I know for sure was"
1233800,1240440," actually my idea. I was genuinely stunned to the point where I thought I was being trolled"
1240440,1246840," when I was first informed that we were like, they were not renewing."
1246840,1255800," And yeah, I don't know. Oh, wow. I haven't looked at views for these in a while."
1255800,1262280," I think we're both going to be way short. Sarah's is 4.7 million. Dennis's is at nine."
1263080,1269560," David's is at six. I actually don't think I've watched one that I didn't think was just fantastic."
1269560,1278360," Yeah, Pluth's is 2.4. Alex's is 5.7. Brandon's at three. Chases did 4.2. It's a great thumbnail,"
1278360,1285400," though. This is a fantastic thumbnail. Look at his computer. Fricking guy. Love it. Andy,"
1285400,1290760," I broke his bed. I mean, that's a thing is like, that's why reality TV works, right? Like, you can't"
1290760,1297160," write. You can't write. Yeah, you can't write wilder stuff than just what happens when you try"
1297160,1302360," and complete a project together. And especially when people have me do really weird stuff, like"
1302360,1309400," paint their basement, right? But that happened in Andy's. Are we off by like, we're off by a lot."
1309400,1315640," I think we're off by a lot. Is it like 88 million? So I was off by like 20 percent. Yeah."
1315640,1319400," I mean, you were off by more. So I guess I can give myself a little pat on the back for that."
1319400,1324920," But like, realistically, I look at analytics infinity percent more than you these days. So"
1324920,1331720," the fact that I wasn't closer rather than you were means I might not be doing the greatest job at"
1331720,1337080," that. Yeah, they've clearly been killing it. Yeah, I'm excited. I'm excited to do more."
1337080,1341960," The good news is that if the first couple perform well, and hopefully Andy's not watching this to"
1341960,1346120," know that we can't stack the deck a little bit, because they will, then we should be signing a"
1346120,1350760," long term deal and we should be able to keep these things rolling because there's so many people"
1350760,1355960," that you guys a haven't gotten to know very well or b haven't even met yet. There's people who work"
1355960,1365400," here that I haven't met yet. That's a weird feeling. It's super weird. I have no idea how to deal with"
1365400,1370920," it. Like there's there's people who work here who's only interaction with me on a weekly basis is"
1370920,1375720," to watch the WAN show. So I was actually just going to bring this up. I've been worked from home for"
1376280,1382840," a long time. So this has been happening to me for a while. Right. And I'll walk into the office and"
1382840,1391480," walk past groups of people that I've just like never seen before. And I'm like, oh. There was a"
1391480,1396520," stretch there after the summer where I think every Monday morning meeting we were announcing a new"
1396520,1401160," hire new person like new people and you aren't even in those meetings. No, we're going to have to have"
1401160,1406840," name tags. Like seriously, we're going to need uniforms. Everyone wears the track suit. Okay,"
1406840,1412760," I'm on board now and name tags. Yeah, Dan's given us Dan's given us the thumbs up. Heck yeah,"
1412760,1416360," we're all going to wear the track suit. Okay, you guys have got to be wondering about this."
1416360,1421160," Normally we wait a little bit deeper in the show to kind of talk about what's going on"
1421160,1428840," on an LTT store, but I can't contain it. Yes, we did it. We made a track suit. Why did we make a"
1428840,1435720," track suit? For the only reason anyone makes a track suit because we can. I have no idea how"
1435720,1441560," many track suits we're going to sell. This was not this was not one of those projects that's like,"
1441560,1447560," well, we could calculate the total bill of materials cost and the minimum order quantity and profit"
1447560,1452360," margins. And I think we could figure out if we could make no, no, none of that happened. We were"
1452360,1461240," like, oh my god, we should do a track suit. And then we did. Okay, it's poly cotton blend. We've got"
1461240,1467560," here. Hold on. I say I got a I got a model for you guys. Okay, we've got the LTT logo on the thigh."
1467560,1472520," Okay, we've got the nice nice deep pockets zipper pockets. Okay, you don't want your stuff falling"
1472520,1477960," out. Super pockets are a win. Gotta love the zipper pockets. YKK as always. Beautiful. Two more"
1477960,1484120," zipper pockets on the back. Zippers right there. Okay, got the accents got the accents on the back."
1484120,1492280," Okay, got the zipper pockets zipper pockets on the sides here. All right. YKK zipper. Okay,"
1492280,1499560," got the got the quality. Okay, got the quality. You've got your chest pocket too. Oh, yeah,"
1499560,1504600," forgot about the chest pocket and the chest pocket has a sub pocket. That's for like Airpods or"
1504600,1508520," wireless headphones or whatever else. So you got them right there. That's actually kind of neat."
1508520,1513080," Also, if it's a condom, not that I'm saying this track suit will get you laid. You will need one"
1513080,1517080," if you want it. Not that I'm saying that. No, we can't say that. We can't say that. But they know."
1517080,1529320," Honestly, that is really what happened. We were like, we're just doing a track suit."
1531640,1537720," And then we did. They were almost tearaways. Like for how for how off the hook this merch"
1537720,1544040," meeting was. Okay. I think it's probably good. They weren't tearaways. I completely unhinged."
1544040,1548920," Did you ever have a pair of tearaways? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Who didn't? I was I was a 90s kid. Did you"
1548920,1554760," actually like think they were good? No. No, I thought they were good. Yeah. Okay. They were just"
1554760,1559800," cool. Yeah. You just had to have them. Yeah. Yeah. No, no, no one thought they were so stupid. They"
1559800,1564040," took forever to put back together. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I was ridiculous. This is just"
1564040,1570120," not everybody. Everybody knew everybody knew. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. But like they're sick. They're"
1570120,1576920," tearaways. It's true. So every once in a while party trick, boom, pants off. It's great. Can you"
1576920,1582920," track that so don't have the Alaska? I like the Alaska on the ankles. Oh, um, for these types of"
1582920,1587720," pants? Yeah. I think when we do our joggers and stuff, you guys are going to see they're going to"
1587720,1592280," have they're going to have elastic still on the bottom. For those types of pants, I think it makes"
1592280,1597880," sense. I don't like it generally either, but like, yeah, for like running weird stuff. I think you"
1597880,1603400," want to because if you don't, they just fly all the replace too much. By the way, probably the best"
1603400,1611240," thing to come out of the tracksuit is the photo shoot for the tracksuit. Yeah. These are actually"
1611240,1617480," amazing. These are amazing. So massive shout out to Tanner from the writing team for being the"
1617480,1625800," one who brought in most of our props to kind of complete the ensemble here. But man, we had a lot"
1625800,1634840," of fun. That's got some, that's got some, what, what year was that even like 2010 Duke Nukem"
1634840,1643160," energy? I don't know man, but these are amazing. Oh my God. Oh my God."
1643160,1652840," Colton money potter right here. Oh man. Awesome. This is great. Yeah. Again, shout out Tanner. Tanner"
1652840,1660200," absolutely deserves a lot of a lot of the credit for this. Okay. Got the last eggs. Yeah. Anyway,"
1660200,1666440," so you guys can get yours at lttstore.com. I'm a be completely transparent with the all we did not"
1666440,1672920," order a ton of these. I think we went pretty much minimum order quantity because we're going into this"
1673240,1681800," going not expecting. Yeah. I mean, I'm always down to be surprised, right? But who knows? We could"
1681800,1688440," move a thousand today. We could move zero today. Yeah, actually, I'm going to, I'm going to re-up a"
1688440,1693800," question from, from Jonathan here. What do you, do you know, I should have asked Nick about this"
1693800,1697560," really? We had a meeting earlier this week. Do you know what the status on the tall shirts is?"
1698760,1704840," Because you know that one random show where I had to, I had to, oh right. No, it was when I couldn't talk"
1704840,1709320," the J and silent Bob show and I had to be given a random shirt because the colors clashed really"
1709320,1715800," badly. I was given a shirt that wasn't one of ours. Yeah. I don't, it's a, it's a few different"
1715800,1720360," companies on the front. I don't know what it was for. Sorry, I don't remember. But whatever."
1720360,1727080," But it was in tall format. Yeah. And I'm not making any comments about the quality or anything"
1727080,1733400," like that. But the fitment of the length, that's the best fitting shirt I have ever had in my life,"
1733400,1739480," not even remotely close. And I had, there's this thing and people comment on it all the time,"
1739480,1744280," where I constantly do this. Yeah. Because I'm constantly pulling my shirts down because I'm like,"
1744280,1751240," I'm not crazy tall, but I'm fairly tall. But all of my height is in my torso. Yeah. So shirts just,"
1751240,1756520," they have never fit me properly. Though the, the bottom of the shirt is like, oh, on my waistline."
1756520,1762840," Thank you boys coming. Husky boys coming. Very excited about this. I know that they've taken"
1762840,1768680," longer than we wanted them to. I didn't even know, I like knew we were planning on making a tall shirt."
1768680,1773080," I didn't know it was like a thing. Oh, yeah. Until I wore that shirt. Oh, like, oh,"
1773080,1779080," oh, 100%. I thought I had just been wearing like, and our, our intention, unlike a lot of,"
1779080,1787160," you know, custom fits or whatever is that our, our lanky and our, it's either going to be chunky"
1787160,1791240," or thick boy or something like that, whatever we end up calling the fits. I like thick boy,"
1791240,1795080," but it might be dated. They're good. Yeah. Yeah, it could be. But whatever we end up calling them,"
1795080,1799640," the pricing will be exactly the same as our normal ones. Awesome. We want to make sure that,"
1799640,1806040," like pricing is just as inclusive as the fits that we offer. It's just taken a lot longer than we'd"
1806040,1811000," like. We've had so many projects on the go. You guys are only seeing the tip of the iceberg for"
1811000,1815640," what's coming in the next like three to six months. But my understanding is that that is"
1815640,1820680," absolutely a top priority for Bridget in the next little while here. Awesome. Yeah."
1820680,1826200," I just, it made me excited because I knew we were planning on releasing those. And that's the first"
1826200,1831400," time I'd ever worn a shirt that was made for, for I don't know, taller, torsoed people. I don't know."
1831400,1837000," And I was just like, wow, I don't have to pull it down every minute. This is amazing. Yeah, I know."
1837000,1843400," It's absolutely something that we're aware of. It basically showed up on my radar when we did that,"
1843400,1848920," that long sleeve circuit board design shirt that I almost killed because I was like,"
1848920,1853800," these sleeves are ridiculously long. And we sold it saying, hey, look, the sleeves are super long."
1853800,1858280," And basically every lanky boy in our audience bought it was like, this is the best shirt I've"
1858280,1865000," ever owned. And I was like, oh, yeah. Oh, okay. Well, we can do that. We just, we, we,"
1865000,1871720," it's taken way longer than I would have liked. But stuff's hard. If you want to do things properly,"
1871720,1877720," yeah, it's really tough. Yeah. It's totally good. I just, I just, it's more like, it's not like,"
1877720,1882280," where are they? It's more like, Oh, I'm my, my excitement is redoubled, basically. Yeah."
1882280,1887880," It's, and it's especially exciting based on just like how well received our blanks are."
1887880,1891720," Like the reviews are all like this. It's like, this is great. This is great. This is great."
1891720,1899320," This is great. Yeah. The blanks shirts are doing really well. I just, oh, exciting announcement."
1899320,1904600," Our t-shirt printer has apparently found a small space to start to set up in. So hopefully,"
1904600,1907640," we'll start to get some shirts printed, which would be really great. Good."
1907640,1914840," I wasn't given any kind of updated any points. So I guess this has been in, in, in progress for a"
1914840,1919240," while. And I'm, I'm really excited to start spending some money with our t-shirt printer again."
1919240,1923640," Let's go. I got the money. I got the money right here. I got the shirts right here."
1923640,1929480," You take money in shirts. You send me back shirts with pretty things on them. And then"
1929480,1934360," it's going to be good. Everyone's going to win. That's what I like. I like, I like multi wins."
1934360,1940120," Everyone wins. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Lots of wins. Nobody needs, nobody needs to lose, you know?"
1940120,1944280," Why does it have to be like that? We're all going to make it bros. Yeah, right. You know,"
1944760,1948840," why is that? Why does it have to be like that? All right. Anybody get that reference? Maybe. I don't"
1948840,1954520," know. No, I didn't get it. That's fine. Okay. Sorry. What do you want to talk about next?"
1954520,1961640," I knew you wouldn't. I was asking the audience to be fair. Ouch. Okay."
1961640,1968520," What skates a bit of a, a bit of a niche reference? Sick burn. Wow. Okay. This might surprise you."
1969160,1974280," But the track jacket and the track joggers are selling at a near one to one ratio."
1974280,1980840," That doesn't surprise me. I know. Oh, I was actually surprised when they were separate items on the"
1980840,1988040," store. Well, it's sizing. This makes sense. If people have a tall torso and short legs or vice"
1988040,1993160," first. I literally just made the comment. Yeah, it makes sense. All right. I got you. This may never"
1993160,2003160," have occurred to you, but not everybody has exactly the same proportions. Got him. Okay. Yeah. Um,"
2003160,2010680," chatbot wars. Sure. Yeah, let's talk about it. There's a chatbot thing that I'm going to"
2010680,2015720," go against, but we can talk about that later. Let's talk about the general chatbot wars."
2015720,2022360," This I have not been as in on because apparently I'm not a cool kid and have not been invited to"
2022360,2027080," Bing search, but I guess the company has. So we'll be able to mess with it on the show, which is cool."
2027080,2034680," 100%. But there's been a lot going on. We talked about chat GPT and its various antics"
2034680,2041240," quite a bit there. And then we kind of let it die down for a little bit. And now it's back."
2041240,2048760," Things are boiling. Microsoft has released a demo of its new chat GPT 3.5 plus is what I'm"
2048760,2055880," going to call it, enabled version of Bing search as well as a wait list to receive access to the"
2055880,2060360," full version. The wait list is hilarious, but I think we're going to get into that in a moment."
2060360,2065720," Part of the demo showed a typical search, a typical page of search results, but with AI context"
2065720,2070600," notes on one side. Can you can you do a search with the context notes? Oh, okay."
2070600,2076920," Well, another mode allows the user to talk to the Bing chatbot directly. What I find kind of"
2076920,2083400," interesting about this, and maybe we'll show this in a moment, but the the AI context notes on the"
2083400,2090440," side. If you didn't know they were there, in my opinion, are not very noticeable. So this is"
2090440,2096520," is this is this chat or is this search? I don't know. Okay, just give it a shot. Ask me anything."
2096520,2104040," Okay. Why is Hogwarts legacy so controversial?"
2106520,2113640," Well, what what what what you guys don't want to be canceled? You don't want to be canceled?"
2113640,2118200," I just I just I just I thought this is America."
2118200,2124440," Sometimes at the top, if we cover on the show, you will think that's okay. All right."
2124440,2131880," Let's jump let's jump back jump back jump back. Okay, so yeah, this is not this is not a view that"
2131880,2137480," I have actually personally seen. So this is probably because this account is in"
2137480,2143080," and mine at home is not in. I have not received an invite. Okay, so Hogwarts legacy is so"
2143080,2147240," controversial because it is the first time many people have been asked to prove they support"
2147240,2153400," trans people and they have been found wanting. I okay, to be clear, I think that the with the"
2153400,2158440," syntax here is a little confusing web. That's a web results. I'm pretty sure the first time"
2159880,2165080," many people. So it's not the first time anyone has been asked to prove it, but it's the first"
2165080,2169080," time for many people, I guess is one way of I think that's just a web result though. Yeah,"
2169080,2171880," this is just yeah, this is okay. Chat chat chat chat chat. Here we go. Wait, wait, wait,"
2171880,2177880," okay. Go back. Don't go to chat. Go back. Okay. Can you full screen it or something something's"
2177880,2182600," wrong here? What's a Seymour thing? Seymour Seymour. Seymour Butts. Seymour Butts. It's"
2182600,2187400," going to be a new Bing. Well, I don't know. I want to do this one. Yeah, so it's it's definitely"
2187400,2191800," this. No, it's not. What do you do? This is my point. So the thing we're trying to describe. Yeah."
2191800,2198200," Let me read it out again. Part of the demo showed is a typical page of search results,"
2198200,2203240," but with AI context notes on one side. So normally if you scroll up, you see that thing"
2203240,2208600," where it says trending on Bing above there, there's a box where it has the AI output. Well, let me"
2208600,2214040," do this. All right. Well, we're not going to see it. That's fine. You know what? Can you just chill?"
2215080,2217480," Can you just relax? I'm just going to look like a."
2217480,2226280," Okay. Wait, what changed? We're not signed in anymore. Oh, well, that's not good. So what's"
2226280,2231960," happening? We can't read that. Dan, you're holding up a post it note from like 15 feet."
2231960,2237720," You wrote it. That's not even the side you wrote on. You can walk it over. I can tell from here."
2237720,2243000," There's no pen on that side of the paper. I could tell it was on there. Just can't read it."
2244840,2249080," What's that? Oh, is that a password? That's a password to the account for Bing."
2249080,2256360," Well, I don't know the username. No, I don't know the. Is it the same as the email that's on here?"
2256360,2261320," Okay. You can figure that out. Yeah. I don't know if I can figure that out."
2261320,2264600," Hey, you just go to Gmail. Why don't you go to Gmail? I could."
2264600,2268360," Well, you want to give me that? Why don't you both go to Gmail? I will."
2269560,2280120," It's on Chrome. Well, I prefer stainless steel. Okay, I got this. So it's an at gmail.com account."
2280120,2288920," That doesn't make any sense. Okay, then it's not the account. Click on Linus."
2288920,2296760," Oh, oh, it's that one. Well, why would. How the devil am I supposed to know it's that account?"
2296760,2300040," Also, if I'm signed in, if I can click the Linus in the top,"
2300040,2306360," well, why would I want to use edge? Okay, so I'm going to use that as an offboarding so that"
2306360,2310840," while you do that, I can keep talking about other things. I'm going to skip a bunch. I don't know"
2310840,2313480," if it's somewhere here in the notes. I'm going to try to find it. I'm sure it's somewhere here in"
2313480,2319000," the notes, but if it's not, I'll just talk off top of my head. The wait list is hilarious,"
2319000,2323560," because not only do you just sign up for the wait list, but they're like, hey, you want to skip"
2323560,2327320," the line kind of will push you up in the line. We're not actually going to put you all the way"
2327320,2333080," through. We'll maybe put you through. Well, you have to set your computer to Microsoft defaults"
2333080,2340440," for everything as far as I know. Oh, what? And I think you have to do something else."
2340440,2344120," Let me see if it's in the notes. I didn't see it immediately. I think it is though."
2344120,2348120," I'm just not seeing it. Oh my god. Um, ridiculous."
2348120,2352680," F wait. It's going to take me like four hours to type in now because I'm going to make mistakes"
2352680,2358200," because I'm trying to talk while I are you able to talk while you type for type. Well,"
2358200,2364440," you sometimes yes, sometimes no. I think if I'm even like slightly off, if I'm like a little bit"
2364440,2369160," tired or something, it's just gone like immediately. All right. Here we go. Line us laptop. Um,"
2369160,2374120," ask anything. Oh my god. Join the wait list. I thought I'm supposed to have it."
2374120,2379480," I thought you were to. Are you sure it's this account, Dan?"
2381560,2386920," Yes. I don't think this was actually set up by Dan. It was not, but this is the account."
2386920,2392040," And this is the same account that you were logged into on Chrome. So that doesn't make any sense"
2392040,2396680," though. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So someone in full plane chat just bailed me out. The other thing is"
2396680,2401640," you have to install the Bing app on your phone. What on your phone? Yeah. So you have to set your"
2401640,2406280," computer to Microsoft defaults. And then they have a QR code thing that you scan with your phone and"
2406280,2409960," you have to install the Bing app on your phone. So you have to do both. There's a chat button."
2409960,2415800," Which is amazing. Hold on. It's working. It's working. It's working. Oh man. Welcome to the new Bing."
2415800,2420520," Okay. Yeah. So I haven't seen. I haven't used this. Here we go. Here we go. It's working."
2420520,2426040," Okay. Hogwarts Legacy is a video game set. Our cameras covering it. Okay. Video games set in"
2426040,2430280," the Harry Potter universe, but it has been facing controversy due to the transphobic statements"
2430280,2437560," made by author JK Rowling and the alleged anti-Semitism in the game's story. Some people are boycotting"
2437560,2441800," the game to show their support for the trans community and to protest against Rowling's views."
2441800,2447320," I mean, that's a good summary. Seems like a good summary. Yeah. Based on everything I've seen so far,"
2447320,2452040," that seems like a pretty solid summary of what people are talking about. This is interesting."
2452040,2457000," It prompts me with extra questions. And one of the crazy. So okay. That's interesting. I didn't"
2457000,2461080," know about that. One of the craziest things about this in my opinion. Yeah. Is this one?"
2461080,2466040," You can search the web. Right. And you can even tell it to search the web. Whoa. Okay. This is"
2466040,2472040," cool. They really want you using chat. A two finger swipe gets you from search to chat."
2472040,2477960," To chat. Good. Yeah. Okay. Do a normal search. I did. And it gave me a chat result."
2477960,2481960," Can you try to do it again? Like do something different maybe? What? You don't want to talk"
2481960,2488360," about this? No. Are you sure? Yeah. One. No, I don't. Two. I want to show. I want to show the"
2488360,2491800," sidebar thing that I was talking about earlier. Okay. All right. Okay. Because I've gotten it"
2491800,2499560," up my on my home computer. So I know it exists. What a jerk. What happened to Luke Clafranier?"
2499560,2507080," Oh, did it automatically bring you up? Yeah. It drops traffic. Yeah. Whoa. Okay. Swipe out of"
2507080,2510440," this for a second. Luke Clafranier is a former employee of Linus Media Group, a company that"
2510440,2516280," produces tech related videos on YouTube. He left LMG in 2018 to become a COO of floatplane,"
2516280,2521080," a video streaming platform that is partly owned by LMG. He still appears on the WAN show, a weekly"
2521080,2525960," podcast hosted by Linus Sebastian, the founder of LMG. Not me though. He also has a Twitter and"
2525960,2531240," got him. He also has a Twitter and an Instagram account where he posts about his personal life."
2531240,2535960," I think the least accurate part is that last slide. Well, yeah. But okay. Okay."
2535960,2540120," Last time I posted on Instagram was like three years ago. But okay. But without being like nitpicky."
2540120,2544760," It's good. It's it's very really good. It's honestly probably better than you would get"
2544760,2551080," from finding a Google search and the context. It understood the context. What happened to him?"
2551080,2556280," It's not like he got a haircut. Yeah. It's what people want to know. Yeah. What happened to that"
2556280,2559160," guy? Why isn't he on that? He's a host of bunch. Now he's like almost never there."
2559160,2564680," That is wildly good. And if I asked, I'm pretty sure if I asked chat GPT,"
2564680,2570840," it will not give you that answer because it'll say like, uh, because it doesn't search the internet."
2570840,2577560," But this one does. So this is this is not just chat GPT into big. I think that's one of the things"
2577560,2581880," that most people are missing. It is not. It is in a lot of, I don't know if in all ways,"
2581880,2589160," but in a lot of ways, it's better. Oh, yeah. Better. Obviously. Way back. Access to current"
2589160,2594840," information is like mind shatteringly huge. Yeah. Like this is absolutely"
2594840,2600120," game changer. Yeah. You know what's really cool? I just made a thousand dollars."
2600120,2609800," Because of the XQC thing. Yeah, there's no way he can't say it's sick because, and, okay,"
2609800,2616360," I don't know who did it. Whoever made the tweet asking it, how many LTT backpacks would fit in a"
2616360,2619880," the trunk of a Tesla or whatever the question was. Oh, I didn't see that. That's what it is. Someone"
2619880,2624840," made that tweet on the LTT handle. Oh, that's really funny. And it did it. It looked up the"
2624840,2628840," dimensions of the LTT backpack. It looked up the dimensions of the trunk and it figured it out."
2628840,2633560," How the **** did it do that? Ask it. Let's do it live. Maybe make it different. Use, um,"
2633560,2639080," use, uh, uh, the, the, the, the banana thing or something. The LTT store banana or something. I"
2639080,2643400," don't know. No, no, I, I, I just want to, I just want to see this. I just want a model."
2643400,2646360," Show your screen. Show your screen. So it's worldwide. Oh, yeah. Sorry. I guess I could. Okay."
2646360,2650680," Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Because I thought the dimensions for the backpack"
2650680,2657880," are in picture form searching for that. Now it's searching. I'll be backpack dimensions. Shut up."
2657880,2666360," This is a tricky question. Then the natural, like language of it."
2666360,2671800," Look at this. I have to do shapes and dimensions based on some rough estimates. I will try to answer"
2671800,2682120," it. It's seen. That's actually nuts. It's still going."
2682120,2690360," Will depend on how flexible and compressible the backpacks are and how well they fit into"
2690360,2696120," the corners and curves of the trunk based on some videos of the model. Why trunk shut up."
2696120,2701160," It can fit about five to seven standard carers, two cases which have similar dimensions and"
2701160,2705960," capacity. Holy. Which is accurate. That statement is."
2705960,2717720," That's. Crazy. I don't know who made that tweet, but that was brilliant because I had watched"
2717720,2723000," demos. I had watched tons of stuff up until that point up until I saw that tweet from whoever made"
2723000,2728920," that on our team. So big. So the team's amazing. Amazing. A maze. Shout out Arthur and Arjun."
2728920,2732280," I didn't realize it was that capable. And if we have any of the people on that team I haven't"
2732280,2737720," met yet. Sorry. The various steps it had to go through. Yeah. Not only did it even showed it"
2737720,2742840," work. Yes. It's searched the original question realized there isn't really an answer for this"
2742840,2746280," out there yet. Decided. I'm going to look up the dimensions of the backpack. I'm going to look"
2746280,2750360," up the dimensions of the trunk. I'm going to realize that this trunk, even though I have dimensions"
2750360,2753800," and whatnot, is going to have weird curves and stuff, which is going to throw it off quite a bit."
2753800,2757400," I know that's in dimensions. Don't worry about it. I said that poorly. But it's going to have"
2757400,2761320," weird curves and stuff. That's going to throw it off. What can this backpack relate to?"
2761320,2765640," Oh, a standard size of luggage is extremely similar. Let's use that because there's other"
2765640,2773960," references to how that can fit in this. This was full thought process, man. Okay. That's crazy."
2773960,2782520," Okay. Okay. But how up to the minute is it? I like LTTstore.com, but I only wear track suits."
2783160,2793560," Do they make a track suit? Holy ***** ***** ***** ***** *****"
2793560,2806520," Hey, it's got a bunch of other stuff in there. Get out of here. Get out of here. Hey, make"
2806520,2813960," it out of here. Screw you, big. Okay. No, but seriously though, that's crazy. That is so crazy."
2813960,2819160," They do not seem to sell track pants. It missed that our track joggers are pants."
2819160,2823720," I asked it to clarify. Holy ***** ***** *****"
2823720,2829000," Hold on a second. So it suggests me pants to go with the jacket I bought."
2830440,2838200," Shut up. Hold on. Okay. That's insane. That's crazy."
2838200,2853640," Oh, this would be the killer feature to monetize this in a free version. This would 100% be a"
2853640,2863080," black and white track pants. Yeah, here we go. Oh, man. Is it going to print out the same"
2863080,2866040," shopping list that it did earlier or is it just going to list all of these?"
2866040,2870120," Okay. So am I going to get links to these? That's what I'm saying. No, no, I'm going to get links."
2870120,2873720," I get links. It's sites. Yeah, there's learn more. So they go."
2873720,2877000," Yeah. Yeah."
2880120,2885480," So if you go back, yeah, this is wild. There's the learn more bar at the bottom."
2885480,2889560," So it has all the links that are referenced. There it is."
2889560,2898840," You should ask it like, are you sure? Like, I would get it to relook at the LTD store for the pants."
2898840,2908440," I really want the purchase be from LTD store, whatever. Is there another option from them that"
2908440,2911880," would work or something like that? I don't know. I don't want to I don't want to lead it too well."
2911880,2915800," Yeah, I'm saying, are you sure they don't have matching bottoms for the jacket? That seems weird."
2915800,2920520," Track. No, it's sticking to track. It wants track pants."
2920520,2924120," I'm not sure why they don't have it, but I couldn't find any on their website."
2924120,2929160," The closest they have are pajama pants and short circuit sweatpants, but they don't look"
2929160,2935560," weight. They don't look like they match the track jacket very well. You can submit to their newsletter."
2937160,2942600," Do the track joggers subscribe to their new match. Hold on. Is it looking at images?"
2942600,2945960," Do the track joggers seem to match? Oh, interesting."
2945960,2952200," No, but I want lose the context of LTT store with that search."
2952200,2958280," It did. It did. It did. Hold on. Is that is that even what we called them?"
2958280,2962040," Wait, wait, wait. It just said LTT store in there. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on."
2962040,2965800," Hold on. I'm coming back. I'm coming back. The track joggers from LTD store."
2966520,2971640," What? It has the same color scheme and logo. Okay, shut up. Do we even say that?"
2971640,2973800," Do we say that? Luke."
2973800,2981720," We don't. We don't say it has the same color scheme and logo. They checked the"
2981720,2990120," logo. Holy shit. I'm sorry. Luke, you got to bleep that"
2990120,3008440," Whoa. What? Whoa. This is like, oh man. When people were like, oh, chat GPT search isn't"
3008440,3015960," gonna matter. Dude, like you have to see it now. This is crazy. The trunk question is really"
3015960,3021480," interesting to me because that is like a hundred percent something that someone could be tasked"
3021480,3026760," with or not that exact one maybe, but something very similar is something that someone could be"
3026760,3033240," tasked with. Maybe the dimensions of the inside of a cube van or the inside of the bed of a truck"
3033240,3039000," with a tonneau cover on it. How many of this exact thing can I fit inside it? How much lumber can I"
3039000,3043400," fit inside a standard size F-150 truck bed? I want to know how. That might be something someone"
3043400,3049000," wants to know. I want to know how carefully it's analyzing images. There's no reviews of the product,"
3049000,3057560," so it didn't see anything in text. Nothing. Our descriptions notoriously are. Oh, can you go back?"
3057560,3062120," In need of some improvement. There's only one version. There's no. Oh wait. Hold on. Oh, no."
3062120,3066520," No, no. I missed. Yeah, that's it. It does say get the matching. That's the only thing that."
3066520,3072680," Yeah, but it didn't say it had the same logo, Luke. There's nothing on this page to say it has the"
3072680,3080360," same color scheme and the same logo. It f***ing checked. Yeah. With images that like, to be honest,"
3080360,3083640," there isn't one as far as I know. That's just a zoom in of the. Oh, there is right there. Yeah,"
3083640,3088760," we've got it. We've got it. Okay. Okay. But it had to check the whole thing. There's one image showing"
3088760,3094680," this logo clearly. Yeah, most of the images, it's there, but it's pretty small because like a zoom"
3094680,3100280," out of the person. What just happened? Yeah, Google just got irrelevant. Conrad said in chat,"
3100280,3106920," I might actually use Bing when this comes out. Yeah. You will. I tried to jump the wait list."
3106920,3112680," I did everything I could. I set to defaults and then I change it back afterwards because I don't"
3112680,3117880," think they're tracking that. Hold on. And I installed the Bing app on my phone because 100% I would"
3117880,3121480," switch immediately. Hold on. People asking about alt text just a sec, just a sec, just a sec."
3121480,3127320," How do you see it? I thought them. Oh, okay. I think we only have it. Yeah, no, no, no,"
3127320,3138200," there's nothing in there about that. That's. Wow. Okay. Okay. So, hold on. Okay. Okay."
3138200,3144280," Now I got it. I'm not done yet. I'm not done yet. Try to get it to match unrelated products on this."
3144280,3150760," No, I want it to. Okay. Okay. That's a whole, that's a whole can of worms that we can go down. I mean,"
3150760,3156200," okay, we know it has at least rudimentary ability to recognize stuff like that because it said,"
3156200,3160680," hey, the pajama pants don't seem to match this very well, right? Yeah. Like it figured that out."
3160680,3171160," But I want to know, does LTT's lanyard seem durable? Like, is that in our thing? Do we say"
3171160,3176760," that it's durable? I'm going to check. I'm going to check. I'm sorry. I'm freaking out a little bit"
3176760,3181880," right now because this is better than I expected. And I've been sitting here with you hearing you"
3181880,3185400," go blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, chat GPT, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, future,"
3185400,3189160," future being blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, ahead of, I mean, anyone reporting on it in the news"
3189160,3194680," because you figured it out before any, if they went public with it. Yeah. So that's the context"
3194680,3200600," for this though, is that I'm still blown away. I mean, you seem blown away. Oh, yeah. Like, did you"
3200600,3206680," expect it to be this good? I have known for a long time that once it gained the ability to search the"
3206680,3213080," internet, that it would be a whole different beast. But I didn't know how effectively it would do more"
3213080,3218600," than one search that I'm, I'm really telling you when I saw that tweet, my brain exploded."
3218600,3223960," Because it grabbed the context, it searched the first thing. It was like, this didn't give me an"
3223960,3229080," answer. I'm now going to search these two various things to gain information. And then ours went"
3229080,3233320," even deeper. And it figured out, oh, it matches standard luggage sizes, all this kind of stuff."
3233320,3238760," Like it pictures the amount of it steps pictures, the amount of steps that it did. That would have"
3238760,3244440," been a significant amount of work for a human, a very significant amount of work. Did it look at"
3244440,3250680," videos? That would be interesting. It's watching us right now."
3257000,3263640," Based on some videos of the Model Y drunk. Yeah, I did say that, didn't it?"
3263640,3272920," Did it link to this? Yes."
3272920,3280360," Is there a transcription for that? Because that was an article, right? Did they write out like"
3280360,3287400," everything that was in the video? I don't know, Luke. But it specifically cited this page and"
3287400,3295640," said based on some videos. Maybe maybe the page is based on the videos. I don't think it would"
3295640,3300120," watch the video necessarily. Maybe it would. I don't know. I have no idea what's going on anymore."
3300120,3306520," But it might have used whisper, another open AI tool to gain the text transcription of the video."
3307080,3313400," And then it could have parsed that. Okay, here. He's asking it some stuff. I'm asking it something"
3313400,3318920," else. Okay. LTT says their landyard is built to last, but do the materials look durable to you?"
3318920,3325400," Interesting. I mean, look, I have no idea if it has this kind of capabilities. Okay. So it's"
3325400,3328440," looking up the landyard. Yeah. Now there's two results for landyard on the store."
3328440,3334360," According to the product description, it's constructed from a heavy-duty nylon weave,"
3334360,3337480," featuring a block stitch link in a medium pressure metal class. These materials are"
3337480,3341720," supposed to make them in a terrible. Okay. Oh my God, it read reviews."
3341720,3351720," Which are very positive. It might. It might. It might. Just look at the star rating."
3351720,3357480," No, no, no, no, most of which are positive and praise the quality and appearance."
3360920,3367720," Okay. Okay. Yeah. Ask it for it. What are what are maybe maybe refine it in a weird way, ask it for"
3367720,3373400," two star. What do people know? No, no, I got this. Okay. What about the negative reviews? What do"
3373400,3387880," people not like about it? Not very common, but they do exist. Some of the complaints, it's too"
3387880,3391400," short and sits too high on the chest. The clip is hard to use and makes taking keys off the"
3391400,3395640," land. You're difficult. The review system is not reliable and allows people to leave reviews"
3395640,3407480," without purchasing the product. It knew that. That last bullet point is big because we're like"
3407480,3413880," moving to change that now, not even kidding. That is actually real. That is possible. There"
3413880,3417880," was a reason why we didn't change in the past. I don't remember what it was, but we're moving"
3417880,3423400," to change it now. By the way, the length thing is probably based on older reviews. We revised it"
3423400,3428520," to be a couple inches longer in response to that feedback, incidentally. You know, what's going to"
3428520,3435400," be significantly faster now is parsing feedback for items on the store. Why bother manually go"
3435400,3439960," through and read it all when you just ask it for a summary of everything that's currently"
3439960,3446360," seemingly wrong with your products and it will immediately spit it out and also give you feedback"
3446360,3455080," on the website that was crazy and accurate and good feedback. Whoa."
3455080,3465240," Okay. I want to see it. I want to see it try to match unrelated things on the store."
3465960,3471880," So what my idea is, is can we ask it to match like a water bottle? Sorry, I picked up my water"
3471880,3479240," bottle to take a drink. I did not take a drink and put it back down. Luke, you know what I want?"
3479240,3488040," I want it to give me a summary of this Wanshow. It's live right now. Yeah, but Google has live"
3488040,3492280," transcriptions. I don't think it'll be able to do that. No, that's a lot. I mean, we could try it."
3492280,3495800," I don't think that's going to be a success. I don't think that's reasonable. Yeah. I mean,"
3495800,3502760," we are already, we are already beyond reason. Yeah, I mean, it ain't no reason where we're going."
3502760,3511400," Boys. Okay. Can you ask? Can you ask? So the water bottle, let's pick that. So go to the water"
3511400,3517880," bottle and pick a color that you like. Okay. Can you pick a color of water bottle to match"
3518920,3524200," my LTT tracksuit? Tracksuit, sure. You might want to specify the water bottle should be from"
3524200,3528440," LTT store.com. Can you pick a color of LTT water bottle? I mean, or not, my teacher."
3528440,3541240," It looks for the water bottle. It looks for the tracksuit. It's looking at stuff. Oh, oh, it"
3541240,3549880," couldn't find it. Oh, if you're looking for a water bottle, some of the colors that might go"
3549880,3553880," well with the tracksuit are black, white, red or blue. You can also mix and mix"
3553880,3558600," them out different colors for the lid and body. So in its defense, which is not super major,"
3558600,3563160," because I'm actually surprised it didn't figure this one out. But we don't call it tracksuit"
3563160,3573880," anywhere. Yeah. Okay. Hold on a second. Oh, so you know what? I think this is our first kind of"
3573880,3582200," swinging a mess here. A little bit. Yeah. Because that link is yeah, men's tracksuit from Nike."
3582200,3591080," Yeah, this is just this is the black and black one. It's in stock. So that's something."
3592360,3596760," Okay, this is Amazon.ca, though. Did it intentionally send me to Amazon.ca?"
3596760,3602760," I was going to say one of the first weeks that we talked about chat GPT, I mentioned how I was"
3602760,3609080," in the camp where I thought VR and AR were going to be like the future. Yeah. And on one of those"
3609080,3615560," first weeks, I was like, never mind, it's this. And I think that just got a lot more deeply rooted."
3615560,3620120," Yeah. Even with that failure, it doesn't matter. Look at all the successes that it just had before"
3620120,3622760," that. Yeah."
3622760,3634680," We do not have a red LTT logo. Where did it get that from? No, they exist. There's a red LTT logo on"
3634680,3640440," one of the water bottles. No, but the track jacket. It says the track jacket has a white and"
3640440,3646600," black color scheme with a red LTT logo on the chest and the back. Is it making assumptions?"
3646600,3654040," I want to know why it thinks that. Okay, clothing. Sorry, I know that I'm basically just using this"
3654040,3659400," entire topic as an excuse to talk about LTT store. I mean, it's a it's an acceptable medium."
3659400,3665480," So maybe this is remember the confidently wrong thing. Maybe we're giving it a little bit too"
3665480,3670360," much credit. Maybe it's not actually looking at the pictures. Maybe it's making some guesses."
3671720,3677160," I don't know. I think it's looking at pictures, Luke. Okay. I mean, I could be wrong. Why does it"
3677160,3688840," think it's red? Super weird. That's super weird. Okay. Okay. Oh, oh, yeah. Yeah. Ask it why it"
3688840,3694200," thinks it's red. Okay. Okay. Sure. For its evidence. Someone in full point, I mentioned that."
3694200,3701080," I don't see a red logo on that jacket. I grain so the can you send me the picture?"
3701080,3709800," Okay. I'm bored. I don't know. Can you send me the picture? Interesting. Yeah, like it. Oh,"
3710680,3728520," whoa. Underscore red. Holy crap. So it got the red logo from the file name? No, searching"
3728520,3734600," track jacket, LTT store. Okay. Wait, I have read some stuff. I don't know how legit this is,"
3734600,3739080," but you might want to start a new thread and try this whole thing over again. Okay, but it"
3739080,3744200," checked. It did look at pictures for sure. I found one on the product page, which shows a black and"
3744200,3751960," white jacket with a white logo. Wait, what's the one on the click on the link? Because that's not"
3751960,3757000," to the right thing. Yeah, that's not our store. And that's also not a black and white track"
3757000,3765880," jacket with a red logo. What? Okay. Start a new thread. I've read that this version will kind of"
3765880,3771240," lose the plot once your thread gets too long. Okay. I forgot about that until now. But yeah,"
3771240,3774360," let's start a new thread. Man, I refresh the page and it's still"
3774360,3784120," okay. It's because of this. Hold on. Okay. Okay. Bing.com. Let's go. Okay. Okay. What we're"
3784120,3793160," trying to figure out. Oh, okay. Okay. Can you pick a water bottle on LTT store to match my LTT"
3793160,3799160," track jacket? Okay. Let's just let's just see. Okay. Insulated water bottle. No, no, this is"
3799160,3807080," just standard search. Here we go. My mind is absolutely annihilated right now."
3807080,3820200," Okay. I want these. Are these just Amazon links? Oh, interesting. Those look like"
3821800,3828600," no, those are LTT store links. I want one that will look good with my new LTT track jacket."
3828600,3846120," Okay. It just called it simple and stylish. Chest and back. How on earth?"
3846840,3853720," Just back it again. Workshop jacket. It's losing the plot. It's having issues with this one."
3853720,3859000," I think one of the things that it might be struggling with is the color selector for the water bottle."
3859000,3865240," Yeah, I think it doesn't know because in the images on the side of the water bottle,"
3865240,3870760," yeah, there's just every color possible. And then I have a feeling that it can't"
3870760,3873560," parse through the color selector. That makes sense. And we have"
3874600,3880120," fun but weird names for things. I mean, not pink, but like sunrise, cream, scream,"
3880120,3886120," hero. Like, I don't think it's going to know how to parse that either. Yeah. Okay. Okay. It's"
3886120,3890680," suggested a 21 ounce one that would be more convenient to carry around though. Like, it's not"
3890680,3898520," like it's even when it's failing. It's not like it's completely. It's not stupid. Yeah. It's"
3898520,3903880," you know, it's just it's just maybe missing some amount of capability. That's a super specific"
3903880,3911080," question though. Yeah. Pretty interesting. All right. I am sure it's more specific colors."
3911080,3915240," Maybe ask it. I'm I'm getting a."
3915240,3922920," Okay. Yeah. You wanted to ask it some other stuff about the store. I think I kind of hijacked it."
3922920,3927480," No, it's fine. I wanted to ask the same question you were asking but in the other way. I wanted to"
3927480,3932600," give it a one of the multi colored items and ask it for a single colored item effectively."
3933320,3938200," So like, I don't know if you want to hand it this much information, but like I'm getting a"
3938200,3945080," white and black L2T water bottle. Can you suggest a shirt from the same store that would go with it?"
3945080,3952280," Something like that. I was hoping to be able to give it like one of the obscure names. Like,"
3952280,3957960," I'm getting a hero water bottle. But I at this point, I don't think it's going to be able to do"
3957960,3961480," that. And white and black is technically one of the names that we use for it. So whatever."
3961480,3964440," Can you suggest some clothes from the same store that would go with it? How about that?"
3964440,3965640," Okay."
3965640,3973160," Clothes. I mean, okay. That's fine. Yeah, that's that's clothing is a category, right?"
3973160,3979240," I can suggest some stuff that would go with your water bottle. GPU plush underwear, three pack whoops."
3979240,3988040," Two generic rock row. Honestly, a lot of those things aren't clothes."
3991400,3995000," Okay. I mean, yeah, GPU plush. Yeah, exactly. I didn't even put that."
3995000,3997480," I specifically. Whoops."
3997480,4002120," Metched white and black. You can tell it's doing stuff in the background here. Wanted something"
4002120,4010280," that matches my white and black. What do you mean? Why? I can when I'm typing, I can kind of feel it,"
4010280,4015240," like thinking a bit. I don't know. So you think it's like pre-pursing? I'm sorry. I misunderstood."
4015240,4023400," My bad. Wow. Okay. Maybe you could try the workshop jacket or the track jacket we talked about earlier."
4023400,4029240," Wait, it rema. The workshop jacket is not black and white though. Yeah, it wasn't this threat."
4029240,4033640," It was in this thread. Okay. So why does it think the workshop jacket? For some reason,"
4033640,4038360," it's been fixed on the workshop jacket. This one. Yeah, it really likes that workshop. Oh,"
4039640,4046520," it thinks it's black and white. Is that why it thinks the logo's orange? It was looking at this."
4046520,4050760," Maybe. Is there is there an orange logo in this one? Sorry. I think I got away from the mic."
4050760,4055240," On which one? On the workshop jacket. Is there an orange logo? Oh, is there an orange logo on the"
4055240,4062520," back? No, I don't think so. But there's this, which might have kind of looked logo-y. Maybe."
4062520,4065640," And I don't think there's, we don't have a single picture of the back of it. Dang it."
4067320,4070440," I don't have a picture of the back of the Daring workshop. Anyway, the point is-"
4070440,4074120," He's looking good though. Interesting."
4074120,4078120," Trais interesting."
4078120,4084200," Okay. I'm trying to think of like different questions that we could ask it."
4084200,4096200," Okay. I'm assuming you're asking a question right now. Something that I've noticed has been"
4096200,4101560," an issue is something that I think should actually be quite searchable, which is like game guides."
4101560,4105000," Oh, yeah. How do I beat this stuff? Or whatever."
4105000,4109000," But it hasn't been doing it because all the games that I've been searching have been too new."
4109000,4111000," Right. That makes sense. I wonder if it'll find that."
4111000,4111800," Sure."
4111800,4117960," Okay."
4121080,4129400," It did not really go outside of a very, very narrow, narrow search here. It did not search the"
4129400,4136440," web more broadly. To be fair, you didn't ask it to like review it. So it gave you a state of what"
4136440,4140600," it is, which is actually accurate. I think it's accurate to what you asked. You didn't even"
4140600,4144920," ask it anything. There's no question mark. You just Googled what LTD customer service"
4145720,4151560," is effectively. What are customers saying about the quality of their service?"
4151560,4155800," We do have to be honest with the quality of prompts."
4155800,4158680," Yeah. Yeah. I mean, look, I mean, that's the thing is I'm trying to."
4158680,4160360," This is a way of testing. I'm not actually."
4160360,4162840," Yeah. But I'm trying to use it like a user would."
4162840,4165960," Like, no, that doesn't answer my question. So I want to naturally interact with you."
4165960,4166840," You are fine now. Yeah."
4166840,4170360," There are mixed reviews of LTD stores customer service. Yeah. That's fair."
4170360,4173560," Some say they had a great experience ordering from the website and the products are high quality."
4173560,4176840," They also praise the support team for being helpful and responsive. However, some customers"
4176840,4181080," complain about long delivery times and items getting lost in the mail, which they blame on the website."
4181080,4186440," One website gives LTD store.com an average of 3.3 out of 5 based on one review. So it seems the"
4186440,4189400," quality of their service depends on various factors, such as the product, the shipping,"
4189400,4192760," and the support. You may have a different experience depending on your expectations."
4192760,4197240," One thing I can say right now, by the way, guys, this was an excuse for me to talk about it is"
4197240,4203160," we are down to customer support responses during week, during the week, weekdays,"
4203160,4207880," that are down to hours, not days anymore. So you can expect really fast responses."
4207880,4213640," We are keeping the team beefy. We are not going to be like, \"Oh, yeah. Well, volumes are lower.\""
4213640,4221400," We are back to two people. So we are trying to find things for at least some of the extra"
4221400,4224920," members of the team that were brought on to do. We want to make sure that we keep that team"
4224920,4229960," responding within hours as opposed to within days."
4230600,4233640," Phil H. in Flowplane Chat just brought up a really interesting point."
4233640,4239400," He tagged me and said, \"You just used the verb Googled. What might replace that word?\""
4239400,4243560," Bing. That is what Microsoft has been trying to get us to do for 10 years or whatever."
4243560,4253400," I mean, as a technophile, obviously I would go like chat, search, keep a chat."
4254600,4262280," I would know the underlying technology that I am using. They have an internal name for it called"
4262280,4266840," Sylvie or something. I don't remember what it is. But they are trying to communicate externally"
4266840,4272360," that it is just Bing. It is such a shame that they used Cortana on such a piece of sh*t product"
4272360,4276040," because that would have been great. Imagine Cortana was this. I know, right?"
4277560,4283320," Yeah, I completely feel the same way. Yeah. Just such a missed opportunity."
4283320,4288600," I would be so down for this to be Cortana. That would be super cool."
4288600,4295400," It is also probably a little too normy in mainstream. Would you ask Cortana for a recipe?"
4295400,4302440," I don't know. I mean, I wouldn't ask Cortana anything because she was useless for so long."
4303240,4308040," I mean, I wanted to like Cortana, but it was rough, man. Oh, geez. Okay. Well,"
4308040,4313480," we could honestly sit there and throw things through it for a million years."
4313480,4321320," Do you want to ask it how to beat Biomass? Don't even refine the game. Just say Biomass."
4321320,4324120," Yeah, I'm already asking how good the LTT store screwdriver is though."
4324120,4327800," Cool. I wonder if it will reference videos?"
4330760,4338440," Wow. All right. Wow. It says that the embossed LTT logo on the end cap is tasteful. Where does"
4338440,4343960," it get that from? What is that based on? What do you mean tasteful? How do you know?"
4343960,4354040," Seems to be our call slash shop doesn't have the LTT store screwdriver. It's all Amazon links."
4358920,4363320," Can't you find any user feedback for me? Like it says, go find some user feedback. No, you"
4363320,4371320," **** do it. And it's just blowing my mind."
4371320,4383640," Wow. There's your feedback."
4387400,4392920," Hey, may want to read more reviews and watch more videos. Oh, oh, what videos would you recommend"
4392920,4401720," I watch to learn more? I actually think this is not a fair summary, but whatever."
4401720,4411880," I wonder if it airs on the side of like not being not recommending too strongly."
4411880,4414200," It seems like it tries to balance everything really hard. Yeah."
4416040,4421480," It always ends with the like feedback might be mixed or your experience may vary. That type of"
4421480,4429000," stuff. Huh. This is so cool. It gives you a top level overview of what you can expect to find"
4429000,4439960," in these videos. That is so cool. And those are probably probably the ones you should watch."
4443160,4448280," Now what's interesting is there's a there's a shorts video that's actually got a ton of views"
4448280,4454840," on the screwdriver that's more recent, but I wonder if it's able to parse shorts, for example."
4454840,4464120," I mean, I guess there's only one way to find out. Are there any short form reviews? Those videos"
4464120,4472760," are all pretty long. I just I feel like I could just talk to it forever. Okay. Okay, so sorry,"
4472760,4476120," what game bio biomass? Yeah, it's just a biomass, I think."
4476120,4485960," Yeah, because that's a that's a Valheim boss, but it's a I think pretty unique name for a boss"
4485960,4496440," in a game. I don't know. Oh, it called our product description a review. Well, that's not very good."
4499000,4506520," Okay, but they did find an opinion on Reddit, a couple on Reddit. Okay. All right, very cool."
4506520,4511960," Okay, how do I beat how do I beat biomass? Yeah, I don't even want to mention Valheim,"
4511960,4513240," because I want to figure it out. Okay."
4513240,4520840," Sure. This is totally off topic out of nowhere. That might be an interesting"
4520840,4526040," how to beat biomass. Yeah, what what are you talking about?"
4526920,4536360," Yeah, it is not all the third boss in the game, Valheim, the ways to beat it may vary. For example,"
4536360,4541960," if you mean the massive living organisms, you need to reduce their population or their consumption"
4541960,4543800," of resources. Well,"
4543800,4544600," great."
4544600,4550920," Combed. Whoa, buddy. Can you please clarify though, which is fair?"
4552280,4556120," The question that I asked at the end is fair and they gave you a little smiley face. It's cute."
4556120,4564920," Yeah, I don't want to reduce the population of living organisms."
4564920,4575080," Oh my God. It's bone mass. Oh, it's still understood that it was from Valheim."
4575080,4579560," Yeah, I said the wrong thing though. It's bone mass."
4581480,4588440," Oh. It figured it out probably through like common searches or something."
4588440,4595720," Wow. That's actually crazy. I also type of this. How to beat bone mass in Valheim."
4595720,4602360," Yeah, it just doesn't acknowledge my, oh, I see highly resistant to ranged weapons,"
4602360,4605640," except for frost arrows. This is oh, I didn't know that part."
4605640,4609960," Okay. He throws poison smoke. The best weapons are blunt weapons. That's true."
4611000,4616120," Increased stamina regeneration. Wow. This is a lot of like really good strats. It looks like"
4616120,4617960," good luck. It is a good one."
4617960,4625960," All right. Wow. Yeah. Let's let's get on. The fact that it got bone mass from biomass."
4625960,4629320," Pretty interesting. We could do this all night. I think."
4629320,4632760," So let's let's finish off the notes because there is some interest."
4632760,4636680," Sure. Yeah, I hit it. This is a war, right? It's not just being searched."
4636680,4641000," There is the other side. So far it's. So far it's just been."
4641000,4646920," It's a war between your high school bully and like your toddler sister, like honestly."
4646920,4654840," Yeah, a little brutal. Microsoft claims they're using a more powerful version of GPT 3.5"
4654840,4660760," that they are calling the Prometheus model presumably in the sense that if it goes wrong,"
4660760,4666680," Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella will be tied to a rock for Eagles to devour his liver."
4666680,4672200," Microsoft, this is a big bet forever too. I think so. I think so. Yeah."
4672200,4677880," This is a big bet for them though. Microsoft will also launch two new features for Edge."
4677880,4682040," Chat which users can use to ask about the webpage they're looking at"
4682040,4690520," and compose a writing assistant. I don't think we saw compose, but I think that was a"
4690520,4696120," weird description of chat, which is what we're just using. Only a day after Microsoft's demo,"
4696120,4705560," Google announced its own chat GPT equivalent or similar thing called Bard. Some people have"
4705560,4710440," been criticizing that name. I actually think it's pretty cool. Google's demo highlighted largely"
4710440,4716360," incremental and previously announced AI improvements to various Google products. In the demo,"
4716360,4721800," Google warned that answers given by Bard may be inaccurate, which is true about all of them."
4721800,4726680," So it doesn't matter. Some commenters noted that there was a clear inaccuracy in a screenshot"
4726680,4731320," included in Google's announcement, which states that the James Webb Space Telescope was the first"
4731320,4736040," to take a picture of a planet outside of our solar system. The first was actually taken by the"
4736040,4741720," European Southern Observatory's very large telescope actual name in 2004. Now,"
4743960,4753960," there are some kind of potential issues here. I have heard, let me see if this screenshot is in here."
4753960,4759720," I've heard our audience really likes tracksuits, but sorry, go ahead."
4759720,4766200," This is just a random tweet. This doesn't look like the one that actually found it."
4766200,4772360," I don't know. So people read this and maybe they're right. I just want to put that out there."
4772360,4777480," Maybe people's interpretation of this was right. But people read this as it says here again,"
4777480,4782120," which states that the James Webb Space Telescope was the first to take a picture of a planet outside"
4782120,4791080," of our solar system. People interpreted that as any planet. But people are thinking that maybe"
4791080,4797080," Bard was actually talking about a specific planet. I see. And the James Webb was the first"
4797080,4803000," telescope to take a picture of that planet. And that planet is outside of our solar system."
4803000,4806840," Yeah. So maybe it weren't it weird. Maybe we interpret it poorly. I don't know."
4806840,4815960," But it's kind of irrelevant. Because Dan's question, please. I want to say I'm a DQP."
4815960,4816920," I'm working on it. Okay."
4816920,4822840," Wow. I was trying to figure out what the heck DQP meant."
4824200,4827400," But yeah, it could have been right. It could have been wrong. It's kind of irrelevant."
4827400,4834680," They're all right. And they're all wrong sometimes. GBT 3.5, chat, GBT, whatever we want to call this"
4834680,4840600," Bing search thing. They've all been wrong at some point. Bard will be wrong. This is wrong sometimes."
4840600,4841400," It doesn't really matter."
4841400,4850280," Yeah. No, it can't just like watch a video."
4850280,4851880," There was no way it was going to do that."
4851880,4855960," Yeah. Yeah. So why would you need to watch?"
4855960,4860360," Apparently Google's valuation went down a hundred billion dollars"
4860360,4864440," when people figured out that Bard was wrong, which is weird to me."
4864440,4865640," Seems like a bit of an overreaction."
4865640,4867160," Chat GBT is wrong all the time."
4867160,4872280," Yeah, I call it constantly. I mean, it didn't know that the LDT storage screwdriver is like the best."
4872280,4874840," Terrible."
4874840,4880520," So like that seems kind of weird to me. But I mean, investors are going to do investor things."
4880520,4884440," So by the way, this looks kind of like what you might have been talking about earlier,"
4884440,4888200," where you can be on a page. And there's just like a search thing here."
4888200,4891000," And you can just like this is not what I was talking about earlier."
4891000,4895000," I mean, this seems like it would be a really cool interface. But no, this just does a web search."
4895000,4902280," Yeah. This does not even if you tell it like this site. It's basically just like,"
4903960,4911560," you know, is this a good jacket? Like it doesn't. Yeah, it just does not do anything like what we"
4911560,4915800," what we saw before. So there's no chat integrated into that particular search at this time."
4915800,4920600," Unless I've like not updated it properly or something like that, I'm not sure."
4920600,4925160," All right. Yeah. So move on."
4925160,4933080," Yeah, I can't get it to do it. When I was at home, basically in your standard search view,"
4933880,4938840," pre chat, it's an interesting thing to say, where you have all the links to different websites to"
4938840,4943480," come up when you search something floating in the side where like if you Google to yourself,"
4943480,4947560," you know how it would show like the Wikipedia thing with your picture in that same area,"
4947560,4952840," it was putting like a mini version of a non-respondable to chat output."
4952840,4959880," Some people are saying there's a there's a version of edge that is like a dev version that has the"
4959880,4964360," new Bing v features. So like you would be able to do that in there or something. This is just a"
4964360,4971720," pleb version of edge. Okay. Yeah, got it. Wow. That makes sense. Wow. Yeah. A third search provider,"
4971720,4977880," Baidu headquartered in China announced that it would finish internal testing of its own AI"
4977880,4984600," named Ernie in March. E-commerce company Alibaba also claims to be making a chat GPT equivalent"
4984600,4991960," and Opera. And this is a dig that seems potentially unnecessary. But the world six most popular browser"
4991960,5001400," says that they they too will be incorporating chat GPT. Whoa. Ouch. Whoa. Yep. Let's go."
5001400,5006440," Everybody's getting in on this discussion question. What pitfalls do you foresee in the rushed"
5006440,5011960," integrated advanced AI into day to day technology? I think that's pretty easy answer to me. Yeah,"
5011960,5017560," I think so too. A lot of the confidently wrong the wrongness. Yeah. I do think that as much as I"
5017560,5021880," say that, which is every single time we talk about this topic, he sure does. It's important"
5021880,5027400," because people constantly forget it. Like it's actually crazy. Yeah, it's like the whole it's like"
5027400,5032680," the whole discussion we had around Tesla branding their driving assist says autopilot. Yeah. And it's"
5032680,5038840," like you get people who will get mad at me for criticizing it saying well, that's not what autopilot"
5038840,5042920," means. Like even on a plane, it doesn't mean the plane flies itself. It's still needs a pilot."
5042920,5047560," Who'd be stupid enough to think the autopilot means it drives itself to stupid. No, because"
5047560,5053960," people think that 100%. I don't make the rules. People fall asleep on the highway. Like on purpose."
5053960,5059480," They take a nap in their car with autopilot engaged. Yep. 100%. They get."
5059480,5066760," Yeah. So we have to. So we have to remind humans. I I this is the caveat that I want to throw in"
5066760,5073480," here. Humans are also really confidently wrong. Yeah. So it's not like this is like an unknown"
5073480,5080520," issue. Oh, Luke, just laying the smack down on an entire species of animal here. But like,"
5080520,5085560," you should be skeptical about answers that come from chat GPT. And you know, maybe you should take"
5085560,5093480," that skepticism to other parts of your life as well. But like, yeah, like if you were just blindly"
5093480,5099800," believing every single Google search result that you got in the past, that was also a problem."
5099800,5103320," I don't know if you like realize that, but you shouldn't have been doing that."
5103320,5106920," And you still shouldn't do it with chat features."
5106920,5114840," Well, I didn't even see that question. I'm just me. The next discussion question is, is there a"
5114840,5121320," concern with large companies under repressive governments constructing their own advanced AI?"
5122040,5125880," I mean, yeah, obviously, it's obviously definitely going to be about that."
5125880,5131000," All right. Yeah, that's the thing with a lot of this type of technology. People talk about,"
5131000,5136760," Oh, we need to like regulate it super hard. And it's like, yeah, good luck, maybe in certain ways,"
5136760,5140280," but you still haven't figured out how to regulate other countries."
5140280,5144200," Well, not social media, like you're not you're not going to stop the wave of this happening."
5144200,5148920," Yeah, because some other countries just going to be like, I mean, you can do it here. Yeah,"
5148920,5152920," we're going to find a way to get a leg up because companies are going to come here now because they"
5152920,5158120," can do this thing. They can come here and not pay taxes. Yeah, like is. But hey, at least the"
5158120,5162440," people working there will they'll pay their taxes for corporate tax. No, I don't need never."
5162440,5169400," Let's jump into another thing. Should we do this? It's another AI topic. Should we jump into it?"
5169400,5171720," You know what we should probably do is get sponsors out of the way,"
5171720,5177400," what merge messages are. You're probably seeing these messages pop up down here. Dan,"
5177400,5182040," our producer is monitoring them. If you guys make a purchase on LTTstore.com,"
5182040,5185560," and while we are live, you will get a little pop up prompting you for a merge message."
5185560,5191000," It's basically better than, whoops, Twitch bits or super chats or anything like that because"
5191000,5195640," we might get to your message. We might not. But if we don't, hey, at least you get some"
5195640,5201480," nice high quality, you know, track suits in the mail. Yeah, if nothing else, you can bring up a gift"
5201480,5205400," card and send a merge message that way. And then you can pick up something else that catches your"
5205400,5212440," eye farther down the line. Oh, we have something really cool coming. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,"
5212440,5218040," guess what's here? It won't be applicable to you, unfortunately, but the WAG hoodie has arrived."
5218040,5224440," Oh, I mean, Chloe. You don't have it. Oh, well, okay. For a little while. Yeah."
5224440,5232120," Well, that's sad. Well, you know what? She's doing pretty okay. Chloe can have a WAG hoodie for"
5232120,5239560," however short at time she will be wearing it. But this got pretty real. My parents dog is quite old."
5239560,5243960," Yeah. Been holding the phone for like a long time. Yeah, yeah, she's doing great. But she's pretty"
5243960,5250840," old. But it has been a long time. Yeah. Cool. So anyway, the WAN hoodie for dogs is kind of here."
5250840,5254920," We haven't done pictures or like gotten it ready for the site or anything like that, but it's"
5254920,5258440," almost ready to launch. You need a flap now. A flap?"
5260040,5267960," They go wang it. WAN hoodie for birds. I hate it. Yeah, I was gonna say animal cruelty much."
5267960,5273960," They would probably if you made it like a little WAN hoodie like ornament that I could"
5273960,5278200," hang from the cage, I guarantee you they would love that. Yeah, they probably like destroy it"
5278200,5286280," immediately because they're birds. Yeah, they do that. Okay, cool. Anywho, right. So"
5286280,5290120," merch messages, we will try to get to some merch messages at the end of the show."
5290120,5293080," And we'll all want to thank our sponsors for sponsoring this."
5293080,5301560," Whatever. Yeah, whatever the show is today. Massive shout out Thorum. Thorum makes handmade"
5301560,5305800," wedding bands and rings from rare unique materials. They work with anything from whiskey barrels to"

5312600,5318760," made out of hammered black tungsten carbide with a rose gold interior. And the reason they chose"
5318760,5323480," these materials are because tungsten carbide will neither rust nor tarnish. Thorum claims that"
5323480,5328680," you can leave it in a vat of ferric chloride acid for a year and it will be entirely fine that we"
5328680,5335800," wouldn't recommend playing with ferric chloride acid. We're having it around for an extended period"
5335800,5345720," of time. You can get a kind of sponsor talking points or these. You can get a ring size or"
5345720,5349960," a ring can take it. You might not be able to, but you can't. Don't put your hand in there,"
5349960,5356760," but the ring will be fine. You can get a size or kit on their website to make life easier when"
5356760,5362040," it comes to picking the best size for your finger and every ring ships within one business day and"
5362040,5365880," comes with a free Thorum silicone activity band. Oh, that's what I was holding. Sorry. And a beautiful"

5445480,5450680," I don't know who to blame for that. Probably someone, but it doesn't matter. The point is,"
5450680,5457800," I have to do a sponsor read. So is this they say that they have a thing that helps you with writing,"
5457800,5463560," but you're using the more web searchy thing. Does your browser not have the writing thing?"
5463560,5467000," Yeah, I don't really see it. I've just got search and chat."
5467000,5469400," Yeah, I don't. I'm going to go for it. Sure."
5469400,5474280," Whoa, what do you think? Whoa, I didn't even see this."
5474280,5482520," Holy crap, that's powerful. It asked what you think of this whole saga that's gone on here and"
5482520,5487960," gives you a prompt. That's wild. So they're going to be like, what the?"
5487960,5492760," Collecting, collecting political data. Whoa. What?"
5493960,5498360," Okay, look, I'm not trying to steer the conversation back to being powered by chat GPT,"
5498360,5502200," but what the f*** just happened? Well, they're trying to make it an actual chat,"
5502200,5506680," and they're going to harvest all the information from it, which is incredibly valuable data."
5506680,5519800," Wow. Okay. Whoa. Okay. Geez. Oh, man. Okay. This is something. All right. Back to this."
5519800,5525400," I have a to do. Oh, I have to. Sorry. Do a sponsor read on my podcast for Squarespace,"
5525400,5531640," but my talking points are a little stale. Sorry."
5531640,5539800," Can you write me? Oh, my goodness. Sorry. My brain is very tired."
5539800,5542840," Should we clear the context before we do this? No, no, it's fine. Okay."
5542840,5545240," Can you write me? Do they want that on the screen?"
5545240,5552280," Uh, 32, whatever. They'll get over it. Can you write me a 30 to 60 second blurb with some of their"
5552280,5557640," latest features highlighted? Oh, apparently you need. Yeah, you need the dev branch of edge for the"

5662120,5667160," something like that. Oh, she can just get it to write her books? Honestly. Like with the quality"
5667160,5670440," of the writing of some of the ones I've looked over her shoulder at, she could just be like,"
5670440,5675640," \"Write me another chapter. Write me another chapter. Write me another chapter.\" If she doesn't like"
5675640,5678760," the direction that the book goes in. Choose your own adventure."
5678760,5686840," Because I've done choose your own adventure stuff, right? But especially if it can search"
5686840,5691960," off the internet. Like you could make a choose your own adventure based on like vaguely real"

5713640,5719480," Let's go. Seriously though. Yeah. Like it's from. Oh my goodness. It probably could. Because this one"
5719480,5724440," can search the internet. So it knows everything about it. Can you, you should ask it that. What"
5724440,5730040," would you change if you could change Game of Thrones season eight? What would you change about it"
5730840,5733480," to make it better or whatever. And I'm gonna make this poll."
5733480,5746840," Okay. We're really not trying to make the whole show just about being with chat GPT. It's just"
5746840,5758760," kind of happening here. Okay. Oh man. This is just such a mind screw. Okay. No. I don't want. Yeah."
5758760,5765560," There we go. Okay. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Oh my God. Stop. Okay."
5765560,5774120," There we go. Whoa. Give more time and development to the night king and the white walkers and make"
5774120,5779160," their final battle more epic and satisfying. Make Daenerys' descent into madness more gradual"
5779160,5783880," and believable. Show more of her inner conflict and struggle. Make Jon Snow more active and decide."
5784600,5790520," Wow. Make Cersei more cunning and ruthless. Have her put up a better fight. Make the ending"
5790520,5794360," more coherent and satisfying. Have it tie up the loose ends and resolve the main conflicts and"
5794360,5797560," themes. Maybe have a different character set on the Iron Throne or have no one sit on it at all."
5797560,5803480," So basically, yeah, it's just taking, it's taking audience feedback and going."
5803480,5810840," Yeah. Here's what needed to be better. It's like you could, you could crowdsource how to make a,"
5811480,5817880," like you could just be like, okay, um, I love liar liar."
5817880,5828840," Can you pitch me a premise for a Jim Carrey movie that's kind of like that, but for the 2020s?"
5828840,5833400," Like, I don't know. Like, what can it, what can it not do, Luke?"
5833400,5840840," So I asked, uh, Flowplane chat based on these integrations, will you use big now?"
5840840,5844520," And I don't, some people criticize it because they're like, oh, we wanted a maybe or whatever."
5844520,5851400," No, I want like, I want people that are hard facts about this. And so far 80% of people are saying yes."
5851400,5858840," Wow. Kick a Doom over in Twitch chat says, instead of rushing it actually used the source"
5858840,5863080," material simple. There was no source material. That was the problem. That's the George RR Martin"
5863080,5869160," hadn't finished the books. Holy crap. Okay, here we go. Here we go. I have not watched liar liar,"
5869160,5873560," but I've heard it's a comedy movie where Jim Carrey plays a lawyer who cannot lie for 24 hours."
5873560,5880760," Oh, that would be an interesting licensing thing for them to work out. How can chat GPT watch liar"
5880760,5886760," liar? You know what I mean? I'm surprised they haven't just trained it on it and been like,"
5886760,5890200," oh, we'll figure it out later. I guess if you're, if there are a lot of AI stuff is like,"
5890200,5895880," unlike independent artists though, like the MPAA, RA, like the,"
5895880,5901800," have you heard about that tool? Somebody made a tool that can try to reverse engineer what"
5901800,5912680," images that the image generator used in its generation of your image. And then people are using"
5912680,5918360," that to go after the AI generators. And sometimes it's like, man, I'm really not sure what this would"
5918360,5923080," be based off of. And then you see the output from that thing. And it's like, whoa, it's clearly this"
5923080,5928840," random thing that I've never seen before. But like, it's interesting. It's very interesting."
5928840,5934440," Oh my God. Okay. Jim Carrey plays a social media influencer who is famous for his viral videos"
5934440,5939480," in pranks. He is also a compulsive liar who exaggerates and fabricates everything about his"
5939480,5945960," life and personality. He has millions of followers and sponsors, but he is also unhappy and lonely."
5945960,5951080," One day he receives a mysterious package that contains a pair of glasses. When he puts them on,"
5951080,5955240," he realizes that they are connected to his social media accounts and that they record and broadcast"
5955240,5959800," everything he sees and says. He also discovers that he cannot take them off and that he cannot"
5959800,5964280," lie or edit anything he posts. He has to face the consequences of his lies and the reactions of his"
5964280,5968280," fans, friends, family and enemies. He also has to find out who sent him the glasses and why"
5968280,5972120," and how to get rid of them. Along the way, he learned some valuable lessons about honesty,"
5972120,5980120," integrity and love. Whoa. I'd watched this shit at that. Yeah. Probably."
5980120,5986600," And it did just enough to go, hey, it's basically that. But it's newer. But kind of a modern spin."
5986600,5989960," It is different. Yeah. It's different. Yeah."
5989960,5999080," Damn. Let's try to get this version to write an LTT episode."
5999080,6001880," Remember we did that, right? But now it should be able to search."
6001880,6007880," Is there a video that LTT has done recently that didn't go well? It was controversial for some"
6007880,6011480," reason. I don't know. Maybe the WAN show a few weeks ago."
6011480,6024440," Man. I wanted to have to search for it, but I don't know. I've been writing a model for chat"
6024440,6032680," GPT that does our sponsor segment things. Maybe you need to toss that now. Maybe I need to toss"
6032680,6038760," that. Could you have it right? I don't know. Yeah. It's difficult. This is fine. Well, he just did."
6038760,6042840," He had it right the Squarespace one. Yeah. But I think our scripts are different."
6042840,6048520," I wonder if there'd be a way to describe a screenplay for an LTT."
6048520,6051640," Next level. Hold on. Here we go. Oh, no. You're going to feed. Oh, no."
6051640,6057160," Wait. You only curated nine merch messages? There's some potentials as well."
6057160,6059640," Oh, OK. OK. Let me find one of these."
6059640,6067560," You were focused. I want to know. I want to know what chat GPT would answer like a merch message"
6067560,6075240," or something like that. OK. OK. Here we go. Here's a good one from James D. If you two were to"
6075240,6080600," switch jobs, so us, who would give up first and who would do more damage to the company?"
6080600,6089400," Like, how much could it possibly know about us? Yeah. OK. If Linus Sebastian and Luke"
6089400,6100680," laugh, friend, yeah, switched jobs as a challenge. Which one would give up first and which would do"
6100680,6114760," more damage to the company in the wrong role? OK. Let's see what it says."
6116920,6123160," No, I'm going to read it to you guys. I have not watched their videos, but I've heard that they're"
6123160,6127160," both hosts of the WAN show. Hey, look, you got a credit for the WAN show. Let's go. And founders of"
6127160,6131640," Linus Tech Tips and float play media. They're both experts in technology and media, but they have"
6131640,6137160," different roles and skills. Linus is more of a creative and charismatic leader. Oh, while Luke"
6137160,6141640," is more of a technical and analytical manager. If they switched jobs as a challenge, I think that"
6141640,6147400," Linus would give up first and that Luke would do more damage to the company in the wrong role."
6147400,6152600," Boom, get roasting. Linus would give up first because he would not enjoy or excel at the tasks"
6152600,6157240," that Luke does, such as coding, troubleshooting, budgeting, and negotiating. He would also miss"
6157240,6161480," the thrill and freedom of being on camera and interacting with the audience. He would get bored"
6161480,6164680," and frustrated with the details and constraints of running a business and he would lose his"
6164680,6170200," motivation and passion. What? That's probably it. It doesn't know about Yvonne and doesn't know"
6170200,6175240," that realistically she does all of that stuff, not either of us. And it doesn't know that we're both"
6175240,6181480," stubborn as a halibut. Yeah. Neither of us would give up. Luke would do more damage to the company"
6181480,6185800," in the wrong role because he would not be able to handle the pressure and expectations of being"
6185800,6194680," the face and voice of the company. He would also lack the charisma and creativity that Linus has"
6194680,6200440," and he would struggle to entertain and engage the viewers. He would make some bad decisions and"
6200440,6205640," mistakes that would affect the quality and reputation of the company and he would alienate"
6205640,6211960," some of the fans and sponsors. That is my opinion based on what I know about Bum. You may have a"
6211960,6217640," different opinion and that's okay. What do you think of the scenario? That sounds pretty good to me."
6221080,6226440," I actually had fairly similar answers, which is interesting. It's probably not that far off."
6226440,6233080," Like it's not that I wouldn't call you non-charismatic, but there's no doubt that I have more experience."
6233080,6237320," This was never what I thought I was going to do when I was growing up. No, well, I mean,"
6237320,6243080," me neither in fairness, but like I definitely have more experience at it. There's also"
6243800,6250360," way significantly higher potential for negative impact in your role. Honestly, in my role,"
6250360,6254840," like AJ, I'll keep things going. AJ and Jonathan will keep things alive."
6254840,6260360," Well, that I think it would take longer to screw up in my role though. When I make a decision,"
6260360,6269000," any time I make a big decision, it's like we are building a lab that's not going to sink us in six"
6269000,6276040," months. That could sink us in six years. What if I somehow drastically alienated the audience?"
6276040,6280440," I don't really see it happening too much. I don't see it being more like a drastic alienation."
6280440,6284840," I see it being more of like a slow decline. That's so decline. I would see it that way. I mean,"
6284840,6290520," again, this is like it's not taking it. Yeah, it's not but no, I'm trying to tell them because"
6290520,6294600," a lot of the time I'll tell you something that I'm just like, yeah, bro, honestly."
6294600,6302040," We get it and I'm not stupid. Yeah, I'm better at it than him. Okay. I would like buy a lot."
6302040,6308280," I would, but this is off right now, but I would hope so. Yeah, like for real though. And that's"
6308280,6316440," okay. Yeah. And there's stuff that Luke is way f*cking better than I am. And that's okay too."
6316440,6320520," It's fine. Like, I mean, realistically, look at the size of our hands."
6321160,6325560," Who would you choose?"
6325560,6332920," Oh my God. Thank you. I didn't think we were going that direction."
6332920,6341400," Oh my goodness. The point is, yeah, I really just don't think it's, I don't think it's that far off."
6341400,6344680," No, and it's reasoning. It's not that stupid. Makes sense."
6345720,6352680," With the amount of information that it was able to drag up, that was like a pretty logical conclusion"
6352680,6356680," for the come to. Yeah, I mean, obviously there's little things that are missing context. Yeah,"
6356680,6361160," that are not quite right. Like you said, it didn't understand Yvonne's involvement. It didn't"
6361160,6364920," understand the involvement of tons of other people at the company. I don't mind negotiating,"
6364920,6369400," but how would it know that? Actually, I mean, I don't like it. I'm good at it, but I don't really"
6369400,6375080," like it. I hate it. Yeah, you're really good at it though, but I tend to win. You're the cheapest"
6375080,6380600," f*cking bastard I have ever met. You can't talk about the recent one. Find a spouse,"
6380600,6383480," find a spouse who spends your money the way Luke spends mine."
6383480,6392920," Yeah, I don't like doing it, but I if I'm going to have to do it, I'm in. It's optimal."
6392920,6399720," That's me next to this. Yeah, pretty much. I don't. I don't. Yeah."
6401960,6405720," Yeah, I mean, yeah, I'm archiving that. That's, yep, that's a good enough answer."
6405720,6415000," It's interesting too how it trot like it inferred quite a bit off of not that much information,"
6415000,6422360," but it did it pretty well, right? I don't know. Hey, guess who just sent in a chat?"
6422360,6429640," It's good old Christopher L. Hey, Lane. Hey, Linus. Thanks for almost hiring me instead of Luke."
6429640,6434120," In all seriousness, so happy to see what LMG has become. Tell me your favorite memory of working"
6434120,6442040," with me at NCIX Tech Tips wheels. Okay, if that's actually you, which I think it probably is,"
6442040,6448600," because most people don't know that he applied at the same time as you. Oh, yeah, yeah, I know"
6448600,6452680," that makes sense. Yeah, like only a few people. I didn't really understand that, but that makes"
6452680,6459400," sense. He was a close either. It was either second or third. Like he almost had the job. And it was"
6459400,6465960," only down to just like how well you and I got along that it ultimately went to you. And he"
6465960,6470600," was brought on later on. And he did end up getting brought in by the NCIX Tech Tips team,"
6470600,6476040," and he actually ran it for a while until, I mean, well, you know, things started to completely"
6476040,6483560," disintegrate. Yeah, exactly. And he did a great job. So like, I kind of couldn't have gone wrong,"
6483560,6494760," but man, favorite memory. It's less like anything specific, but I will say that there was definitely"
6494760,6502200," some tense time studio sharing in that. Remember the tiny little room that was in the top of the"
6502200,6507960," new headquarters right around the time that we left? Yeah, that tiny little room that all of us"
6507960,6513480," were supposed to be working out of. And then the way that they expanded into that nearby room that"
6513480,6519880," was just like completely packed floor to ceiling with tech. Like that was that was such an incredible"
6519880,6529640," era. If I had to pick anything, I would say shooting the cardboard box challenge. I don't even"
6529640,6536200," remember why that video existed. But there's a lot of videos from back then that are, you know,"
6537480,6544120," Linus cardboard armor. Like, I don't even know if I'm going to be able to find this. But we basically"
6544120,6553560," built ourselves like box armor. I don't know why. And we like fought with it in slow motion or something."
6553560,6562520," NCIX maybe like where did that video end up? I have no idea. Yeah, here we go. Massive giveaway"
6562520,6576280," and fight to the death. I don't know why we did this. Sorry, I need to use this. But, but, no,"
6576280,6579080," no, we're good. We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good. Hey, man,"
6579080,6583240," we're getting better, right? Hey, there's Chris. Don't you remember what you were like when you started?"
6583240,6590360," Hi, welcome to Amsterdam. I'm going to go to Sebastian and we'll be looking at the Sanbian"
6590360,6598600," tech tunic tower. I remember being amazing in every way. I ain't remember."
6598600,6604680," What is this? I think we're improving. All right. A little upstart, smart guy. Tell you what,"
6604680,6613480," how about this? My team versus your team, Dabble to the death. The winner is the best tech YouTube"
6613480,6620280," channel. Okay, I want to make it really clear. I did not write this. Okay. Yeah, what? I mean,"
6620280,6625240," look, it was, okay, you know what? It doesn't matter. I don't know if this at all. Riley."
6625240,6632040," Here's your banana. You're in Riley. I don't need it anymore. Actually, I'm going to make a phone call."
6632040,6639160," You can't agree. Oh, my. Hey, Luke. I'm in this. So, I don't know if this at all."
6639160,6643480," What? Really? I come to MCIX right now. Did you challenge a group of people to a fight to the death?"
6643480,6652440," Again? Maybe. I mean, it doesn't really matter. Okay, Mr. Love. This is actually so bad. Oh, no,"
6652440,6658360," my is terrible too. My is terrible too. Let's let's. I'm 100% off. I think the only good thing I've"
6658360,6664200," ever done right now. Come here. Sorry. No, I'm working. Ask Edel. I think the only good thing I've"
6664200,6669160," ever done was like the when I grabbed the orange and burned my hand. Oh, that was pretty good for"
6669160,6676520," that. That's like the only thing. Fine. You like that. You?"
6676520,6686920," Looks like I'm going to have to do this myself. Wait, I do remember this now."
6686920,6690760," Because you get like knocked over and then they like pretend to beat you up or something, right?"
6692040,6697240," Oh my goodness. So, there's a montage here where we like create box armor and then"
6697240,6700600," yeah, the old helmet."
6700600,6707080," Why did we do this? Yeah, but yeah."
6707080,6715080," Why do I shout that? Why do I have a lightsaber?"
6717400,6723000," Okay, I think that's probably quite enough of that. Anywho, that was a lot of fun."
6723000,6729400," In a lot of ways, man, what we do now is so professional, but what we did back then where"
6729400,6734600," it was more well, I shouldn't even say that we did some pretty cringe stuff today. Okay,"
6734600,6738840," hold on. Well, the production values are better, but I think probably the most fun thing about"
6738840,6746040," this job then, whether it's then or now, is the fact that we get paid. So we get paid professionally"
6746040,6753320," to produce content that realistically has about the writing and planning of like a grade 10"
6753320,6758280," high school media class project, you know? I feel like a grade school high school media class"
6758280,6764440," project would probably have more time. No, no, not it not anymore. Like where writers are only"
6764440,6768680," responsible for like one a week. Okay, fair enough. Yeah, we'd like 12 editors now and all"
6768680,6772680," that stuff. Yeah, we actually like have time to work on things now. But"
6774520,6779240," but sometimes, you know, it's it but it's that same kind of inspiration where even if we are"
6779240,6785320," putting more work into it, like, okay, there's a really cool bit from an upcoming video. It's"
6785320,6791640," good. This is going to come up this come out this weekend. Oh, shoot. Is it not live on floatplane yet?"
6791640,6796360," Oh, I don't have a way to get this unless I'm logged into Trello. I'm not logged into Trello"
6796360,6801640," here. It doesn't matter. The point is we do a bit where I have a raspberry Pi and I go"
6802360,6807000," and I throw it over my shoulder and it like explodes when it lands and then another one explodes and"
6807000,6810440," then the things that come out of the explosions are cool things you can do with the raspberry"
6810440,6815400," Pi. So I'm like, it's a chain reaction of innovation and it shows like a media server and like"
6815400,6822360," like some cool stuff. That's exactly the kind of thing that a bunch of high school kids would"
6822360,6827800," come up with except now we have production values. And I think it's those kinds of projects that"
6827800,6835560," are the ones that stick with you years later. Yeah, 100%. All right. Should we do a couple more"
6835560,6839320," merge messages and then we'll move on to some more topics? Probably. All right. Hit us, Dan."
6839320,6844680," Okay. I've got a few here for you. Oh, yeah. And I need to tell XQC that he owes me 10 grand."
6844680,6850200," It's 10 grand. Oh, sorry. Sorry. A grand. I wish it was 10 grand. I should have bet him 10 grand."
6850200,6855480," I heard he's a gambler. Like I probably could have, I probably could have made a lot more money"
6855480,6861160," based on knowing that chat GPT was coming. Yeah. I also think I cut my hand open on his motherboard,"
6861160,6866680," but whatever. Are you okay? Yes. Do you file a report? Yes. This one's from David. No, it was"
6866680,6871560," just a little tiny scratch. Did you did it bleed? No, no, no. This is from David."
6871560,6878680," Luke, have you ever enjoyed hosting again? And when your team gets back in full capacity,"
6878680,6883320," will we see more of you on the main channel and tech linked? Did it say, have I ever? Is that"
6883320,6890600," actually? Have you enjoyed hosting again? Oh, yeah. When your team gets back to full capacity is a"
6890600,6897960," very astute observation. I can basically say, I won't really be hosting much in the near future."
6897960,6904840," Maybe a little bit to do with this AMD graphics card thing we're doing, but I am freaking slammed"
6904840,6914840," right now because of some things that are going on. But yeah, once that gets resolved, maybe"
6914840,6918840," something here or there. I don't know. It's never going to be like a lot or consistent again."
6918840,6923480," I do too many other things, but it's been fun coming in every once in a while and doing whatever."
6923480,6931160," All right, one more. Okay. This is for Matthew. \"Tracksuit gang. My wife wants to know what"
6931160,6935000," insights you gained from the woman's merch survey. Is there anything you can share?\""
6935000,6943080," I wish we could just ask big women be complicated. That makes sense. They agreed on nothing."
6943080,6954600," Like there was no consensus in terms of size, preferences, just, oh man. Basically, as far as I"
6954600,6966040," can tell, for us to satisfy the women in our audience, we would have to have four times the"
6966040,6974760," product offering and it would be applicable to maybe 5% of the total potential."
6974760,6977880," I think on average, they are much more complicated shapes."
6977880,6982920," Oh, for sure. For a lot of guys, they're very boxy frame."
6982920,6989240," Yeah. It's basically a box or a box with a bulge sticking out of the front of it."
6989240,6996440," Like realistically. A lot less complicated to make general designs for average"
6996440,7003320," and men don't expect things to fit as tightly. It's just a different..."
7003320,7004920," That makes sense to me."
7004920,7008680," Honestly, some of our early garments looking back on them, they weren't that great."
7009640,7016120," They were probably the best thing a dude who's just only ever shopped at Walmart has ever put on."
7016120,7020360," But I think the standards are a little bit different."
7020360,7024440," Yeah. Just your average tech bro."
7024440,7030440," It's like, \"Wow, this is pretty good. Not sh*t. This is better than every trade show shirt I've got.\""
7030440,7034520," Spending money works."
7039080,7043240," I'm not trying to generalize or whatever. The reality is that's the world I came from."
7043240,7045000," These were great."
7045000,7049960," And obviously, we continue to try and do better. But that was where we started."
7049960,7055240," Let's move on to another topic. What do you want to talk about?"
7055240,7065480," I want to talk about new Chinese phones loaded with malware and also non-Chinese phones loaded up"
7065480,7072440," with seemingly unnecessary amounts of software. So, a study has found that new Android phones"
7072440,7077160," are being sold with spyware embedded in the OS and pre-installed apps in China, which is a"
7077160,7082920," massive shocker. Popular phone vendors like OnePlus, Oppo, Realme, and Xiaomi, as well as network"
7082920,7087880," providers and services like Baidu are collecting huge amounts of sensitive personal information from"
7087880,7093240," users. And this is wild. The devices continue transmitting data even when they leave the country"
7093240,7099000," or when the SIM card isn't installed. The private sector in China typically has a"
7099000,7102680," close relationship with the government, which raises concerns about broader surveillance."
7102680,7105880," So, that's pretty wild."
7105880,7111880," I'm wondering what the SIM card not installed thing. Do they have some shadow"
7111880,7114760," \"e-SIM\" thing going on? Or are they talking just over Wi-Fi?"
7114760,7117800," You can place an emergency call when you don't have a SIM card in."
7117800,7120760," So, I've always just kind of assumed that the SIM..."
7120760,7127480," Yeah, I don't actually know a ton about exactly how mobile network authentication works. I've never"
7127480,7130280," had a look into it. I believe there's a bypass for emergency calls."
7130280,7133240," Well, there is. Yeah, you can have no SIM and use thing and you can definitely place it."
7133240,7137640," I know for a fact you can make an emergency call. So, who operates that network that your calls"
7137640,7144680," carry? I don't know. But the point is that it's obvious to me that you absolutely can"
7144680,7146920," do stuff."
7146920,7151880," I think there's some... I don't know, but I'm pretty sure there's like an agreement with"
7151880,7155720," all telecos, at least in North America, where you have to service that call if you're the nearest"
7155720,7160600," tower. Sure, it does make sense. Yeah, it doesn't matter. Nothing gets charged. It's just something"
7160600,7169000," you have to do. In more surprising news, Samsung's Galaxy S23 series phones are coming packed with"
7169000,7179160," I kid you not 55 gigabytes of un-uninstallable bloatware. Uninstallable. Uninstallable. No,"
7179160,7186760," no, it's un-installable. For comparison, the system partition is only 15 gigabytes on the Pixel 7,"
7186760,7192760," which contains two copies of Android, one redundant copy for the sake of background OS updates."
7194120,7200760," Oh, this is an interesting note. Samsung is the only major M OEM to not use this two OS system."
7200760,7206760," The massive storage partition of the S23 then is probably due to inefficient code, and the fact"
7206760,7212040," that Samsung is both contractually obligated to install a suite of Google Apps and also insists"
7212040,7217320," on installing their own suite of store brand clones for those apps, for the sake of looking"
7217320,7222280," like they have their own thriving ecosystem. Oh, for the sake of looking like they have their"
7222280,7227080," own thriving ecosystem, Samsung likewise auctions off space in the partition to other companies and"
7227080,7235240," apps. Okay, so I guess we're supposed to look at this phone, which is apparently untouched,"
7235240,7245960," and we're supposed to evaluate how much crap is on it. So Dan's not here. So Dan, oh, not now."
7246680,7256760," Bye. Dan? Oh, I heard back from XQC. I said, it's here. I think you owe me a grand. Maybe do a"
7256760,7262760," stream reacting to the chat GPT being part of the latest WAN show. He says, we'll do. Ha, ha, ha,"
7262760,7264280," ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,"
7264280,7267240," nice, perfect. All right. Hey, Dan, can I get a close-up, please?"
7267240,7268280," Close-up."
7268280,7274920," Uh, on Luke. Because that seems closer. Oh, okay. Well, um, sure. Yeah, that'll do."
7274920,7283560," So there's, this is weird. There's not that much on here. There's Google Apps. There's a handful,"
7283560,7291320," way to go, Dan. There's a, like, small handful of Samsung apps. So then, oh, wow, I like our battery"
7291320,7294520," percentage, though. Nice. Oh, no, Dan. Oh my."
7294520,7299960," Dang it, Dan. What's going on, Dan? Okay. And then, so what is, is the storage even full?"
7299960,7304520," It's what? What the f***?"
7304520,7309320," It just says it's good. No, there's 55 gigabytes consumed."
7309320,7314040," There's nothing on here. That's it."
7314040,7317880," How is that even possible?"
7317880,7323480," What's going on in those folders? Is there, like, hidden stuff?"
7324360,7328360," Google, Chrome, Gmail, Maps, and YouTube. Where's the Samsung proprietary stuff?"
7328360,7330840," Bixby, Messages, and My Files."
7330840,7335720," They've even got one drive on here."
7335720,7340040," That's it!"
7340040,7345640," Yeah, what? Okay, so can you go into that internal storage and figure out, like, what it all is?"
7345640,7351960," Hold on just a gosh darn minute here. Yeah, there we go. System. 55.22 gigs."
7352760,7359800," Okay, I kind of assumed that the bloat was going to be just a ton of apps."
7359800,7362680," Me too. I mean, that's what the notes were good, Dan."
7362680,7366840," I didn't think it was, I didn't think it was going to be just..."
7366840,7371880," It said they're uninstolable. Can you go to uninstall programs?"
7371880,7376520," So maybe it's no, it must be un-uninstallable then. I think that might have just been a typo."
7377960,7382600," That is mind-boggling. So our discussion question here then."
7382600,7385960," Oh, check the apps section and settings and see for disabled apps."
7385960,7390120," Interesting. That's from Brandmo in FlowPoint Chat."
7390120,7394360," Okay. Well, I'm into..."
7394360,7397400," Handyman in chat is saying that it's because of"
7397400,7404760," GB versus GIB. And tech journalists don't know anything."
7404760,7412840," Gigabit? No, these are big bytes. And it also says 55 used, which is 10% of the 512 gig phone."
7412840,7416120," So no, that's just definitely not right."
7416120,7422280," All right. Go to uninstall in current status of apps and stuff. Look for disabled apps"
7422280,7424520," and what apps it lets you uninstall."
7424520,7427000," Sure. Because I feel like things are hidden."
7427000,7429400," Yeah, yeah, that could very well be."
7433480,7434600," Reset app preferences."
7434600,7438440," Dude, there's sorry. I'm just here. We'll go back to..."
7438440,7439000," Just nothing."
7439000,7440040," Go back to the lukem."
7440040,7441240," No, that's good enough Dan. That's good enough."
7441240,7442840," There's nothing in here."
7442840,7444360," Like that's it?"
7444360,7445720," That's really not a lot."
7445720,7452120," No, AR emoji is 172 kilobytes like dictionary 4.1 kilobytes."
7452120,7454120," Nothing in here is over 10 megs."
7454120,7457560," Handyman, just link the article, my dude."
7457560,7459640," That's mind-blowing."
7461240,7465080," And you know what's funny is I was actually about to buy one of these."
7465080,7471480," Yvonne needs a new phone and I need something with dual sim and something that's Android."
7471480,7472760," She's got a handful of requirements."
7472760,7473880," Initial questions for you."
7473880,7474680," Does it matter?"
7474680,7478760," Well, 512 gigs in there, you have over 400 gigs of storage."
7478760,7481800," Right, but not every SKU has 512 gigs of storage in it."
7481800,7484360," So like if you have a lower storage version..."
7484360,7486120," What's the lowest storage of the S..."
7486120,7487640," That's what the S23?"
7487640,7488600," Let's have a look."
7488600,7489800," Galaxy S23, yeah."
7489800,7490760," S23."
7490760,7494360," Is it possible some of it is like reserved space?"
7494360,7497080," Like I'm talking like swap file style."
7497080,7497800," Like I don't..."
7497800,7500680," Again, this is something I've just never really needed to look into."
7500680,7504520," Is there any reason for them to have some reserved space?"
7504520,7506280," Because I could see that being part of it."
7506280,7507560," 128?"
7507560,7509160," No, wait, hold on."
7509160,7509720," I'm going to check."
7509720,7510680," No, it's 256."
7510680,7517320," So if you're talking about a fifth of your capacity being taken up"
7518120,7522120," by just an audirly bloated operating system, that's ridiculous."
7522120,7525800," And even if you are talking about a tenth of it,"
7525800,7528840," even if I do have 90% of my storage, why is that good enough?"
7528840,7531400," Well, okay, hold on a second."
7531400,7533320," I mean, with how much space Windows takes up,"
7533320,7537800," especially when solid-state drives were first coming to prominence"
7537800,7539720," in mobile Windows-based laptops,"
7539720,7543720," Windows would take up a substantial amount of your boot drive."
7543720,7547800," Like if you bought a system with 128 gigs or 256 gigs,"
7547800,7549720," that was significant."
7549720,7552360," Yeah, that's tough."
7552360,7554440," So how do you..."
7554440,7555720," Yeah, this article is saying..."
7555720,7558280," So this is an article from notebookcheck.net."
7558280,7558600," Yeah."
7558600,7560200," Saying if these accusations are true,"
7560200,7563960," then the Galaxy S models with 128 gigabytes of storage"
7563960,7568040," would offer just over 50% capacity for user data and apps."
7568040,7572120," Checking on a 128 gigabyte version of the Galaxy S22 Ultra"
7572120,7573960," reveals that this is not the case."
7573960,7580200," If the screenshot below shows the device reserves 26.09 gigabytes for system."
7580200,7582520," Is it reserving some space just for like,"
7582520,7584120," wear leveling on the SSD?"
7584120,7586840," That's the most plausible explanation that I can think of."
7586840,7590360," Conversely, a 512 gigabyte version of the S23 Ultra"
7590360,7592840," uses 55.23 gigabytes for system."
7592840,7596680," That would also explain why the S23..."
7596680,7598840," So people are just posting their Samsung phones"
7598840,7600600," and how much space system is taking up."
7600600,7605240," So like 128 gig ones are more like 25 gigs, like half the size."
7605240,7607880," And you know what?"
7607880,7612040," It would kind of make sense for it to not scale linearly with storage"
7612040,7615080," if it was for wear leveling, like if it was for"
7615080,7617560," increasing the longevity of the SSD."
7617560,7624840," Because the bigger the SSD, the less the total capacity of it is likely to be written."
7624840,7629240," And the less of spare area you need to allocate in order to extend its life."
7630440,7633000," If that's what they're doing, I'm super okay with it."
7633000,7637640," Like I'm the kind of person who has my phone set to only charge 285% every night."
7637640,7640280," So that it is never sitting at 100% charged."
7640280,7643080," And then I try to grab it before it manages to reach zero."
7643080,7647800," But a lot of people here are saying no, it's definitely hidden apps."
7647800,7649880," I think this is absolutely a developing story."
7649880,7650760," And we don't want to..."
7650760,7656040," Oh apparently yes, they do allocate some space for wear leveling,"
7656040,7657720," but it's not part of the 55."
7657720,7660680," People are saying that it's not reported in that section."
7660680,7664520," Oh this is not good."
7664520,7666840," Not cool."
7666840,7671240," Man, Samsung doesn't need more controversy right now"
7671240,7674600," with the dying SSDs that they've got going on right now."
7674600,7675880," And it's generally..."
7675880,7676920," I don't know what the other is back in the day."
7676920,7677880," Being Samsung."
7677880,7680360," Sure they've done something wrong."
7680360,7683160," Huh."
7683160,7684360," It's interesting."
7685640,7692280," Well why don't we talk about the trip down to Los Angeles and the collab with XQC?"
7692280,7692520," Yeah."
7692520,7700440," I have a new favorite totally deranged Gadsylian Air story."
7700440,7709640," So my old favorite one was to do with Mr. Beast's production process."
7709640,7711400," That was my favorite story to tell."
7712120,7718600," Just the guys so laser focused on just productivity and maximizing his day."
7718600,7725880," There's some pretty mind-blowing to me who people have been telling me."
7725880,7731400," I should have an assistant for a better part of a decade at this point."
7731400,7732680," And I only..."
7732680,7736040," People were surprised to find out that I had one in that assistant swap video"
7736040,7738120," because he only just started."
7738120,7739480," He started less than six months ago."
7741720,7744680," By the way, I'd like to address something from that video."
7744680,7751400," The number of people that are mad at me about being so disrespectful"
7751400,7755080," that I barely even talk to my assistant or look at him or whatever."
7755080,7756600," And that's why I didn't notice."
7756600,7758680," Do you know why I wasn't talking to him?"
7758680,7761240," Do you know why I wasn't paying attention to him?"
7761240,7762360," Because he's in recovery."
7762360,7766360," Because I thought he was at work after having gone through eye surgery and mouth surgery."
7766360,7769000," I was trying to interact with him as little as humanly possible."
7769000,7770600," I'm not using them as much."
7770600,7770920," Yes."
7771560,7774840," So I barely talked to him because he shouldn't have been at work."
7774840,7775560," No, evil person."
7775560,7777800," It's so frustrating, man."
7777800,7786520," It's honestly frustrating how determined some people are to find the absolute worst possible"
7786520,7788280," explanation for anything that I do."
7788280,7792440," Anything I do, it absolutely blows my mind."
7792440,7795880," Anyway, so back to the XQC thing."
7795880,7800840," So my new favorite deranged thing is he was talking about this on stream."
7800840,7804760," So I'm not disclosing something that is private information or anything like that."
7804760,7806760," But as a streamer, he moves around a lot."
7806760,7809560," And we probably don't need to explain why that would be."
7809560,7814520," A lot of streamers move around a lot just for security and privacy."
7814520,7815960," They're public figures."
7815960,7816440," Definitely."
7816440,7820600," And being alive is different from recording points."
7821800,7826680," I worked across multiple content-- I'm not content."
7826680,7828440," It's countries this week."
7828440,7831000," And there was no disruption to our upload schedule."
7831000,7831800," Oh, live."
7831800,7832840," You don't have that luxury."
7832840,7835800," If you don't have somewhere to stream friendly, you're not producing."
7835800,7836360," That's it."
7836360,7837000," It's that simple."
7837000,7840360," So anyway, he moves around a fair bit."
7840360,7842440," And I didn't know that."
7842440,7843320," I have to confess."
7843320,7845080," I hadn't watched a ton of his streams."
7845080,7847720," Not going to hide from it."
7847720,7849480," I might read the comments once in a while."
7849480,7854680," But I'm paying attention to his career, but I'm not watching the streams."
7854680,7856520," And so I wasn't aware of this."
7856520,7862920," But when I walked in, I was kind of taken aback by how bare things were."
7862920,7866440," It felt like that scene in how the Grinch stole Christmas"
7866440,7869800," after the Grinch takes everything but the wire hanging on the wall."
7869800,7872680," And the crumb on the floor for the mouse."
7872680,7874360," He steals the crumb at the right hand."
7874360,7875800," It was like weird."
7877080,7880280," There's a lot of boxes, but not a lot of furniture."
7880280,7887480," And so he was explaining that it came up because I needed some electrical tape."
7887480,7888920," I was like, oh, what are the odds?"
7888920,7889960," Do you have any electrical tape?"
7889960,7893400," Because I wanted to cover up some loose contacts that I was worried we're going to short."
7893400,7896280," And it takes them about five seconds."
7896280,7898680," There's this toolbox that's right there in the room."
7898680,7902200," Grab some electrical tape, new in-box, new in packaging, throws it to me."
7902200,7905320," I'm like, oh, well, this is that's impressive."
7905320,7909240," Because even with my perfectly organized garage that I love talking about,"
7909240,7913400," it probably would have taken me more like 10 seconds, even though my garage is perfectly organized."
7913400,7917640," Anywho, I was like really impressed."
7917640,7919400," And he goes, oh, well, don't be that impressed."
7919400,7921800," That's a brand new toolbox full of brand new tools."
7921800,7923720," I've never touched it, basically."
7923720,7924680," And I'm like, sorry, what?"
7924680,7927400," Okay, why do you have it?"
7927400,7934440," And he explains that he has an Amazon wish list that has all the essentials for living."
7935320,7941320," Every time he moves, he does his every time he moves, he rebies everything sent straight"
7941320,7942280," to the new address."
7942280,7945880," So it's all just there in boxes when he arrives."
7945880,7947960," He unpacks it."
7947960,7953560," He said he brings with him his CPU and like monitor like maybe, I don't even know if he"
7953560,7955080," mentioned his keyboard, honestly."
7955080,7959240," And by CPU, I think he might have meant tower because I doubt he's going to like"
7959240,7960840," pull the CPU out of the socket."
7960840,7961080," Yeah."
7962360,7969480," But it sounds like other than what fits in the back of a car, he takes absolutely nothing"
7969480,7971880," with him and just rebies everything."
7971880,7973160," I'm like, wow."
7973160,7974920," All right."
7974920,7979320," I mean, it's a hassle."
7979320,7982120," I mean, yeah, packing is a pain."
7982120,7984520," And one of the things is like, I've heard this from a lot of people."
7984520,7984760," Yeah."
7984760,7986040," Oh, yeah."
7986040,7989960," And him in particular, as far as my understanding goes, I don't watch either."
7989960,7991160," But again, I follow careers."
7991800,7994840," He has more streamed hours than like anyone."
7994840,7996760," He's just always online."
7996760,8004040," I'll tell you this, just being there with him that one time, guys, a tank, an absolute unit."
8004040,8008120," Like, I don't think I don't think it was out of rudeness at all."
8008120,8013160," But I don't think the thought entered his mind at all of like food."
8013160,8014200," Yeah."
8014200,8018840," Like for real, he had been live for almost five hours when we arrived."
8018840,8021320," We were there for, I think, like three and a half or four."
8021320,8026760," And by the time I was back at my hotel having dropped off Andy and, you know,"
8026760,8030520," said hi to the family and stuff, he was still online."
8030520,8036600," And seeing her going like, it's a good thing that we stopped for some Mickey D's on the way there,"
8036600,8038520," because otherwise we wouldn't have eaten."
8038520,8042680," And not again, like not because I think he was being rude or anything like that."
8042680,8048600," He's just as far as my understanding is, he does marathon level streams, like literally on the"
8048600,8050520," daily, literally."
8050520,8052920," So like he doesn't have time to do that stuff, right?"
8052920,8053960," It would be really expensive."
8053960,8057720," It would be more expensive than apparently just buying it."
8057720,8057960," Yeah."
8057960,8062760," Well, and there's, I mean, I've been trying to like think about this, right?"
8062760,8065560," Because it's like, you know, on the surface, it makes no sense, right?"
8065560,8066520," It looks common ready."
8066520,8071160," But I think it's okay."
8071160,8075160," I think it's probably fair to say that major streamers like an XQC"
8075800,8078920," have a more mainstream appeal than someone like me."
8078920,8084760," Like I think it's fair to say that XQC is more famous than me, generally speaking."
8084760,8085320," Multimension."
8085320,8089000," Like, yeah, like I don't really have a ton of appeal outside of town."
8089000,8091720," Especially as a variety gamer, which I believe he is."
8091720,8092040," Yes."
8092040,8097000," So if I were to walk into a best buy, yeah, obviously to people, I can be like,"
8097000,8097880," \"So please.\""
8097880,8099480," You know, I go into a micro center."
8099480,8101720," I get absolutely mobbed, right?"
8101720,8107480," But if I go into a garden supplies store, nobody knows who I am."
8107480,8107640," Yeah."
8107640,8107960," Right?"
8107960,8110200," Whereas gaming is mainstream, right?"
8110200,8112680," And especially like you said, if he plays all kinds of different games,"
8112680,8116920," then he could appeal to kind of anyone on a certain level, right?"
8116920,8121320," And so from a security standpoint, if he hires a moving company,"
8121320,8125320," that means that everyone involved in that transaction knows where he came from and where he's going."
8125320,8127880," Whereas if he just orders from Amazon,"
8128520,8132440," then he's like, \"Oh, I'm not going to go to the store.\""
8132440,8134440," I'm like, \"Oh, I'm not going to go to the store.\""
8134440,8134840," Yeah."
8134840,8135880," Yeah."
8135880,8137480," And people do all kinds of weird stuff."
8137480,8137800," Like-"
8137800,8140440," There's gotta be like executive like"
8140440,8144600," white glove moving companies where they move like, you know,"
8144600,8145800," maybe."
8145800,8146520," Special people."
8146520,8147640," But are they everywhere?"
8147640,8148120," Can you try-"
8148120,8150040," It probably costs so much anyways."
8150040,8153480," And it's so much to coordinate that you might as well just buy everything new."
8153480,8154440," Because people are weird."
8154440,8156040," Like I've met like, I don't know."
8156040,8160600," I don't want to name any names, but like I've met parents of like my kids' friends,"
8160600,8161560," right?"
8161560,8164040," Who don't immediately disclose that they know who I am."
8164040,8165480," Yeah, I have that."
8165480,8167400," They'll like interact with me for a bit."
8167400,8168600," Oh, I like that so much."
8168600,8170920," They're like, by the way, big fan."
8170920,8171880," I'm kind of like-"
8171880,8172920," Someone very recently-"
8172920,8174120," You need to lead with that."
8174120,8174520," Yeah."
8174520,8177960," Someone very recently asked me about my biggest pet peeve about fan interactions,"
8177960,8180280," and I immediately jumped on that."
8180280,8180840," Hate it."
8180840,8181880," Hate it."
8181880,8183000," Like you don't-"
8183000,8185640," Another thing I hate is like if you and I are out to eat,"
8186040,8189960," and there's someone seated near us, and then like,"
8189960,8193960," we're there for like an hour, and then they get up to go leave."
8193960,8196760," And as they're leaving, they're like, by the way, big fan, and they take off."
8196760,8198520," Then my brain just has to go through like-"
8198520,8199560," What have we been talking about?"
8199560,8201320," What did we say for the last hour?"
8201320,8201800," Yeah."
8201800,8202760," Like just-"
8202760,8204200," That one I get more-"
8204200,8205080," That one makes me more sense."
8205080,8205480," Because like-"
8205480,8207800," You know, it might be socially awkward to say it."
8207800,8209400," We weren't already talking."
8209400,8210680," And like, I know-"
8210680,8213640," I know you can just tell by the body language."
8213640,8219640," Sometimes I know for some people it would have been very stressful for them to acknowledge me,"
8219640,8221480," and then sit there like-"
8221480,8223160," Edict?"
8223160,8223560," Yeah."
8223560,8224920," The dining one on its-"
8224920,8226040," I get it more as well."
8226040,8226600," It's just-"
8226600,8227720," It's still-"
8227720,8230680," As much as I understand it, it still racks my brain."
8230680,8231640," Yvonne's-"
8231640,8234600," Like I'm really careless about it to be perfectly honest with you."
8234600,8238280," Like we should just assume people are watching at all times."
8238280,8241320," I was in line for some attraction with Yvonne,"
8241320,8242120," and I was like-"
8242120,8243800," I was talking about revenue numbers."
8243800,8247800," For like the last year and the next year and projections with like screwdriver,"
8247800,8249240," this was before the launch."
8249240,8249960," And Yvonne's like-"
8249960,8253160," Okay, you're not speaking vaguely enough."
8253160,8253720," Like I'll-"
8253720,8255160," I'll keep it kind of like-"
8255160,8256120," Kind of could be anything."
8256120,8256600," Yeah, yeah."
8256600,8257240," But she's like-"
8257240,8258280," If someone knows who you are,"
8258280,8259400," they're going to put two and two together,"
8259400,8260600," they're not stupid."
8260600,8261640," And like later on,"
8261640,8264440," they must not have heard her say that at least,"
8264440,8267160," because the person in front of us in line-"
8267160,8268040," Turn around was like-"
8268040,8268760," Big fan by the way."
8268760,8269720," Oh my god."
8269720,8271000," Okay."
8271480,8273720," I hope that was nebulous enough."
8273720,8274280," Yeah."
8274280,8276200," Because it was pretty-"
8276200,8279800," It was pretty detailed like financial information about the company."
8279800,8283400," Oh no."
8283400,8284120," Yeah."
8284120,8285800," Yeah."
8285800,8287080," Yeah."
8287080,8288520," Why this isn't into \"ops\" sec?"
8288520,8288680," No."
8288680,8294120," Anyways."
8294120,8296760," Anyway, it was-"
8296760,8299160," It was definitely a different experience."
8299160,8301640," Even though obviously I stream,"
8301640,8303400," like we're streaming for-"
8303400,8304440," You know, how many people are watching right now?"
8304440,8305480," It's not the same."
8305480,8305960," Yeah."
8305960,8308440," Look, look, we're streaming for over 20,000 people right now."
8308440,8311160," We're probably close to 25 by the time you factor in float plane."
8311160,8311640," It's not-"
8311640,8314680," It's not 80,000."
8314680,8315160," We like-"
8315160,8315640," And-"
8315640,8318920," Hang out in his area,"
8318920,8320360," but it's his area."
8320360,8320760," Yes."
8320760,8322200," It's their area, I should say."
8322200,8322680," Yes."
8322680,8324840," Because there's lots of other major streamers and stuff."
8324840,8326440," And aside from just the volume,"
8326440,8328760," honestly, and maybe this is weird."
8328760,8333640," Like maybe I shouldn't have a parasocial relationship or whatever the opposite,"
8333640,8337480," whatever the counter of a parasocial relationship is with"
8337480,8338680," with some-"
8338680,8340760," You know, with an influencer or whatever,"
8340760,8342440," but like when I'm on WAN show,"
8342440,8344920," I'm in my space."
8344920,8345560," Yeah."
8345560,8347480," I'm with, you know,"
8347480,8349480," hold on."
8349480,8351560," My peeps, right?"
8351560,8354840," I'm hanging with you guys who-"
8354840,8355160," Whoops."
8355160,8356760," What did I press?"
8356760,8357400," Okay, there we go."
8358120,8360600," You know, and I consider you guys just like"
8360600,8362440," part of the-"
8362440,8365160," part of the in crowd here."
8365160,8365800," You know, we're just-"
8365800,8366360," We're hanging."
8366360,8367400," Like WAN show is"
8367400,8370280," its own entity that I-"
8370280,8373640," I don't know, I just almost have like a completely different brain space for it."
8373640,8376280," I am often too candid on WAN show."
8376280,8377960," I'm often too transparent."
8377960,8380760," Because the way that I see it is like,"
8380760,8382920," well, you guys will understand."
8382920,8384040," And if you don't, then-"
8384040,8386600," I probably need to explain it back."
8386600,8387640," Absolutely."
8387640,8388520," You know what I mean?"
8388520,8388840," Like-"
8388840,8392360," I'm with-"
8392360,8393880," I'm among friends, I guess,"
8393880,8395720," is the way that I kind of feel about WAN show."
8395720,8397800," On XQC's stream,"
8397800,8399800," it's not like they didn't know who I was."
8399800,8400440," A lot of them."
8400440,8402040," It's not like they weren't down."
8402040,8405720," You know, one of his top spammed emotes is my face."
8405720,8406200," Your face."
8406200,8407240," Like for real though."
8407240,8407720," Yeah."
8407720,8407960," Um."
8407960,8412040," Apparently, XQC has been online for 20 minutes so far"
8412040,8413880," and already has 31,000 viewers."
8413880,8415000," Yeah, there you go."
8415000,8415480," Um."
8416280,8417720," Um."
8417720,8420680," But they're not like my peeps."
8420680,8425640," And so the pressure that I felt was not just about the sheer"
8425640,8428680," number of people watching and the expectations that come with that."
8428680,8431000," But about that for a lot of people,"
8431000,8436600," this was their first and maybe only ever actual interaction with me"
8436600,8439720," doing anything other than making a silly face into my selfie camera once."
8439720,8441240," But twice."
8441240,8441640," Um."
8443000,8446440," And so I was deeply worried that I wasn't going to solve the problem."
8446440,8449000," Like I went way overkill."
8449000,8452440," I brought one of basically everything to completely build a new system"
8452440,8453160," if it came to that."
8453160,8454760," Like if I couldn't figure it out."
8454760,8456760," I mean, but I, yeah."
8456760,8458600," I felt like not figuring it out."
8458600,8463400," And just building a new computer was such a cop out."
8463400,8465160," That was not the outcome I wanted."
8465160,8466520," I wanted to solve it."
8466520,8466840," Yeah."
8466840,8470280," Like I wanted to go find the problem."
8470280,8471400," Speaking of which, Dan,"
8471400,8475000," you had a chance to actually have a look at the motherboard."
8475000,8480440," Was my diagnosis correct or was I barking up the wrong tree?"
8480440,8481400," They'll hear it here first."
8481400,8484360," Does he even have a microphone?"
8484360,8484840," It's muted."
8484840,8485320," There we go."
8485320,8489000," No, you'll hear about it on Monday because I haven't looked at it yet."
8489000,8489400," Oh."
8489400,8491400," Because I've been dealing with other things."
8491400,8492280," It was on my desk."
8492280,8494040," It did graze my hand as I said."
8494040,8495800," It's very heavy."
8495800,8500440," It was nice motherboard, but I will have an update for you next week if that works."
8501400,8501960," All right."
8501960,8503000," Sorry to be disappointed."
8503000,8503320," Thanks."
8503320,8505800," Okay."
8505800,8510120," BNT Masher, no, we do not have a solution for that yet,"
8510120,8512360," but we will definitely make sure you get taken care of."
8512360,8514840," Yeah."
8514840,8520280," So there, I was stressed, like more stressed than I've been on any live stream."
8520280,8521560," Like even when things go wrong."
8521560,8523160," So things weren't even going wrong."
8523160,8524680," And I was still super stressed."
8524680,8527320," I had no way of getting more replacement parts if I needed them."
8527320,8535000," Microcenter was closed and not to mention with LA traffic, you know,"
8535000,8539480," no matter how close microcenter is, it takes a long time to get there."
8539480,8541960," You know how things are down there."
8541960,8545080," So I was, man, I was, I was shaking in my boots."
8545080,8547800," Be perfectly, perfectly upfront with you."
8547800,8551000," Why don't you give us a couple more merch messages, Dan?"
8551000,8552760," Let's get some good Q&A going here."
8552760,8553160," All right."
8553160,8554120," That sounds great."
8554120,8555400," I've got one here from William."
8555400,8556680," Hey, hold on."
8556680,8557240," Oh, no."
8557240,8561080," Ubisoft partners with police to monitor online harassment."
8561080,8561480," Oh, God."
8561480,8562680," What?"
8562680,8570920," First out works is first the officer specialized in responding to online abuse."
8570920,8574920," Well, train Ubisoft's moderation team in their center in Newcastle"
8574920,8576440," for spotting a session."
8576440,8577880," You currently, okay."
8577880,8578840," Well, that's something."
8578840,8579080," Okay."
8579080,8580440," Oh, let's do a batch messages."
8580440,8584120," Oh, okay."
8584120,8585480," This one's from William."
8585480,8586360," Hey, Alina."
8586360,8589240," It said that tech monopolies are bad."
8589240,8594280," Do you think an argument can be made that TSMC's monopoly in the chip industry is good,"
8594280,8598760," as it creates a silicon shield around one of the biggest tech centers in the world?"
8598760,8602920," Well, that silicon shield is going to be eroding over the next three to five years."
8602920,8608680," I mean, Intel and the US and A have made it very clear that they intend to bring"
8608680,8615160," cutting edge semiconductor manufacturing onto US soil in order to,"
8615720,8620680," as far as I can tell, and we're getting into geopolitics that are obviously more complicated"
8620680,8626920," than any of this, but to essentially, as far as I can tell, put themselves in a position where"
8626920,8629480," they don't have to defend Taiwan anymore."
8629480,8637000," And so that if China ultimately decided, \"Yo, Inc,\" they could basically go, \"Maybe we'll do something,"
8637000,8640040," but we don't have to do something.\""
8640680,8647480," They're not quite a monopoly. I mean, Samsung still does have fairly leading edge fab capabilities."
8647480,8653960," And Intel obviously has fairly leading edge fab capabilities and seems to be determined to"
8653960,8655960," play some catch up here over the next little while."
8655960,8665080," But I would say that for the citizens of Taiwan, absolutely, the TSMC shield around their island"
8665080,8669960," nation has been beneficial. For everyone else, though, for the general consumer, no,"
8669960,8673720," I don't think it's beneficial to have a monopoly in any space."
8673720,8677800," It's for the same reason that I would never argue that Linus Media Group incorporated"
8677800,8683480," having a monopoly in tech benchmarking would be a good thing because..."
8683480,8685960," You've always said that you should pull from multiple sources?"
8685960,8688120," Absolutely. It's the best thing for consumers."
8688120,8692360," Okay. I've got another one here from Kevin."
8692360,8696760," \"You're a quality product and great customer service are why I keep buying products.\""
8696760,8701000," Question. What's the most dangerous thing you've ever done life in limb?"
8701000,8706920," I don't know. I've done some pretty stupid stuff."
8706920,8709080," Why don't we limit it to just for work?"
8709080,8716040," I would say that the most dangerous... Oh my goodness."
8716040,8722120," That time I did a flip off the fence with basically no training whatsoever."
8723080,8728120," That was really stupid. I could have easily broken a leg, broken my neck."
8728120,8733800," Why did we jump off fences so much? There was an era there where every couple of weeks,"
8733800,8737240," we were jumping off of tall fences. Yeah, I don't know."
8737240,8741960," I never thought about that before, but that was totally a thing."
8741960,8746280," Some of the stuff I pulled painting houses, not properly harnessed, just to get that one thing."
8746280,8752280," I would not do as an adult, and I would absolutely flip if I saw my kids doing."
8753160,8755720," I could have died many, many times on houses."
8755720,8760840," Yeah, I'd say those are the most dangerous things I've ever done."
8760840,8765800," I'll kind of do anything to get the job done when it comes to just risking it for the biscuit, man."
8765800,8770920," I mean, we're both sort of floored that way."
8770920,8779560," There's been an actually considerably large amount of times where I've been like,"
8779560,8785560," \"Wow, if I was a certain amount of inches to the left, I wouldn't be here anymore.\""
8785560,8791240," There's been way too many of those, and I wish I cared enough about them to remember them all,"
8791240,8799320," but honestly, just don't. I don't know, man."
8799320,8805240," Yeah, okay, let's move on. It is what it is. This is not a recommendation."
8806040,8809880," Oh, can we say not as we do? Yeah. This one's from Scott."
8809880,8814760," Linus, Luke, some people hold on to their old game consoles for nostalgia,"
8814760,8817800," while others will sell their systems to help pay for a newer one."
8817800,8824680," Which one are you? Sell. Sell? Have you ever sold a piece of technology that you later regret?"
8824680,8830040," No, because you can always replace it. Okay, that's a lie. I wish I still had my"
8830040,8836680," ViewSonic P95F+B, my old CRT monitor. That thing was sick. I mean, oh, okay. No, no, that's a bad"
8836680,8840600," answer because things are definitely better now. There were times when I regretted it being gone,"
8840600,8847400," but not really. It was heavy. I regret selling my clips per media ultra 5.1 speakers. There."
8847400,8854920," I regret selling those there. Nothing has really moved into their space for high-end PC"
8855800,8861720," surround desktop speakers. Those things were flipping amazing. Same with my monsoon MM2000s."
8861720,8866920," I would have kept those and not even bothered with the clips if I had realized that they were"
8866920,8872600," going to be so impossible to replace. Is there anything that you've regretted getting rid of?"
8872600,8876760," Because like a game console? No. So commodity. I should have gotten rid of more things,"
8876760,8882520," and I need to continue getting rid of more things. There's been times where I've regretted it."
8882520,8887160," There's been times where I got rid of something too soon, but it isn't that I shouldn't have"
8887160,8891640," gotten rid of it eventually. I just got rid of it too soon. There's been times where I traded in"
8891640,8896680," games to try to get a new game or trade it in a console with games to get the new console in"
8896680,8902520," less games or whatever. There are times where my dad kind of roasted me because he's like,"
8902520,8906280," \"Yeah, you shouldn't have done that.\" Not because I shouldn't have done it at all,"
8906280,8910920," but because again, I did it too. The Logitech Z680's were trash, by the way."
8911800,8917720," I went from the monsoons to the Logitech Z680's. I was so disappointed by the sound quality of"
8917720,8921240," the Logitech Z680's that I went and I turned around and I spent like twice as much of money."
8921240,8927080," I did not have to get the Promedia Ultra 5.1's. Actually, I think I might have gone with GigaWorks"
8927080,8933720," S700's first, and then I forget why I wasn't happy with those, and then I ultimately settled on"
8933720,8942280," the clips from medias. All right, hit me. Okay, this one's from Robert. Hi, Robert. Hi,"
8942280,8946120," Linus and Luke, finally catching you live from the UK. I'll wait. I'm going to interrupt for a"
8946120,8950680," second. I kind of regret selling my first gen switch because it's like the modable one."
8950680,8957240," With that said, you can buy them. I don't know. That's the thing is, as of working adult,"
8959080,8964360," and storage is really expensive. Yeah, it's often, and I don't even just mean personally,"
8964360,8968600," like even for work. A lot of the time, even if it's something I think we could probably"
8968600,8973720," use again later, I would rather just sell it now, let it depreciate in someone else's hands,"
8973720,8978760," and then if we need one again, we have a whole procurement department now, okay, get another one,"
8978760,8984920," eBay it, and then that way on the off, in the more likely scenario that we don't ultimately need"
8984920,8990680," one again. Hey, we will get the money now. My thing is like, I live in a small apartment."
8990680,8996120," I can't keep all this stuff. I actually can't. There's enough room. Yeah, it's not practical."
8996120,8999080," Yeah. Okay, sorry, someone's from the UK, Robert, something, something."
8999080,9008120," Well, Robert loves seeing you so excited over the GPT Bing search. My question is, when were you"
9008120,9013080," last excited about a breakthrough in tech? Oh, well, VR was really exciting for me."
9014520,9022440," Original chat GPT. Three weeks ago. Yeah. Yeah. I can almost remember it. Like it was."
9022440,9031000," Yeah. Check out LMG clips. Yeah. VR. I think it's the same though, either the original"
9031000,9038360," chat GPT launch or or. I was pretty jacked on the stereo 3D at the time. I was, I was, I was,"
9038360,9042680," I was jacked for where it was headed. It was always too headache-inducing,"
9042680,9046120," with the shutter glasses. I couldn't play with shutter glasses. They hurt."
9046120,9054360," But I was, I was jazzed for like stereo 3D to get better and cheaper and then it just didn't"
9054360,9062200," really happen. Yeah. Okay, this one's from Stewart. Hey, Linus and Luke, finally buying"
9062200,9068360," merch to see if y'all are serious about quality. My question, what's the most obscure thing you"
9068360,9074280," keep on hand at all times? I still carry a 30 pin connector in my backpack and it actually came in"
9074280,9079960," handy last week. I had a 30 pin in my backpack up until less than six months ago, even though I"
9079960,9086120," haven't owned a product, I only ever owned one product that used that connector, an iPhone 4."
9086120,9095080," I never had an iPod. I never, yeah, I just, that was the, yeah. Okay. We both still use the same"
9095080,9102200," headphone case to organize things. Mine's broken. It just broke and I lost my I.E.80s."
9102200,9107480," I don't know what happened. I opened up my case, which I still have and sort of works,"
9107480,9114600," on set recently and they just weren't in there. I must have taken them out to like quickly something."
9114600,9120440," Whoa. And I didn't put them back in, so I need to do headphones. That's a crazy end of an era."
9120440,9125640," That was a long era. Had those forever. Yeah. And I like splurged on the inline"
9125640,9129560," mic cable from Sennheiser, like first party one that actually had a decent mic. I hosted"
9129560,9136200," Wanshow from that thing when I was in Hawaii. From that headset. Maybe that's why I left it."
9136200,9140840," I don't know. I'm frustrated though. Are those the ones with the black and white"
9140840,9147960," like striped cables? Maybe. I don't remember. Sorry, I don't think so. So, you were going to"
9147960,9153160," say your weird headphone case? Well, I was just saying it's obscure. We both have it. Yeah, I guess."
9153160,9157000," This like weird steel series headphone case we both held on to for some reason."
9157000,9165160," That's from their Flux. Flux series. Yeah, I don't think either of us actually use the headphones."
9165160,9170040," But they had this little like pouch case. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This weird little"
9170040,9176200," use that pouch case. So yeah, my headphones are not in here, but I have my USB-C to three and a half"
9176200,9181000," mill. My lightning to three and a half mill and an extra pair of ear tips for the Sennheiser I80s,"
9181000,9187080," even though my stupid headphones. Yeah, mine has no longer in here. Old wired ear pods. And then"
9187080,9192920," a few different adapter thingies. Fairly similar setup. Are they a mat though? I don't know."
9192920,9200360," Yeah, I don't have it on me right now, but I almost always have an ATX power supply"
9200360,9206360," pin, deep pinning tool. Yeah. And a Molex deep pinning tool. And man, that came in super handy in the"
9206360,9211640," Intel Arc Challenge, because I needed to deep pin a PCIe connector and it uses the same size pins"
9211640,9216920," as a 24 pin, same size pins as the four and the eight pin CPU connector. So I almost always have"
9216920,9221880," one of those on me as well. This is super not obscure, but I carry a paper clip for a similar"
9221880,9227800," reason, just so I can bridge power supplies. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. One of the like actually just metal ones,"
9227800,9233560," not committed with stuff. Yeah. Okay, I've got one here from Taylor. If you could choose one modern"
9233560,9239240," item to bring back in time and give to people in the 16th century, what would it be and why?"
9239240,9249960," Very specific. One item. 16th century. Okay. Wow. And so I just give it to them. That's it."
9249960,9257480," I would assume so. What about something that could like give to people? So you could like"
9257480,9259880," hand them out, I would assume. Condoms."
9259880,9269720," Seriously, contraceptive. Like, do you know how much less prevalent like STIs would probably be"
9269720,9275240," today if people started using condoms like 400, 500 years ago? 16th century. I think it would be like"
9275240,9283560," a not actually that advanced, but still, medical textbook. A textbook? That's a better answer."
9284200,9288600," Because like you wouldn't want to bring like a phone because it's going to die. Yeah, yeah,"
9288600,9292680," yeah, or like a car or whatever. Yeah, like a medical textbook. That's good. Good answer."
9292680,9296600," I changed my answer to medical textbook. Actually, I changed my answer to engineering textbook."
9296600,9302520," There. Cool. Okay. All right. Carry on. This soap. Chats answers are amazing."
9302520,9310520," What's the crop thing that changed the world? D-D-Z. I'm going to bring the round up."
9313560,9320040," That's wrong. No. It just kills everything. Round up at like a cocktail of round up and rat poison."
9320040,9323560," Just hope they don't drink it. Round up and con. Because man, because man, people"
9323560,9328280," people consume some weird stuff. Like, how did we ever discover cheese?"
9328280,9333400," Like, there's a lot of like, I'm going to eat this. There's a lot of things down that rabbit hole."
9333400,9337960," Like like frickin man, is it like cottage cheese? It's like someone was like, yeah,"
9337960,9343400," this has like been fermenting for months. Basically anything that's fermented, it's like bro."
9343400,9353000," F*** are you thinking? Yeah. What about that, that puffer fish that like if you cook it"
9353000,9357640," incorrectly, you just die. Yeah. It's like, why did you keep trying?"
9357640,9366280," Cheese. I don't know. Okay, this one's from David. Let me just catch my breath here."
9366280,9371960," I sadly just barely missed out on the labs in office tour at on packs for LTX. Is there any"
9371960,9377720," chance you guys will open more spots? We've talked about it. Colton and Chase want to try to open"
9377720,9383000," some more spots, but the reality of it is that there's a finite number of people that we can"
9383000,9388600," filter through here during that time. And we don't want the people who have purchased tours already"
9388600,9392520," to feel like they're being rushed. So we could just like squeeze more money out of people. That's"
9393160,9399880," not the goal of LTX. Like we didn't have enough VIP or like whale packages for the demand. But"
9399880,9407160," if we triple the number of VIP spots, well, then you're not really very VIP anymore. Are you? Right?"
9407160,9411080," Like it's got to be a limited number of people. Otherwise, we can't really give them the attention"
9411080,9417400," that that they need. So I don't think we're going to expand it a ton, but I do think they're going to"
9417400,9422360," try to offer some more as for how they will do all those out. I have no idea. By the way, something"
9422360,9425960," you might want to look into is there's actually a bunch of people posting a flow plane chat right"
9425960,9431080," now. Recent videos that you wore the IE 80s in? I wore them all reacting to worst LTX videos."
9431080,9433960," That's almost certainly when I lost it then. They might be in the couch."
9433960,9442600," Goodbye. Do you want me to check? Oh, he's going. Do you want to? Is there one that I can answer"
9442600,9447720," without that? I'm sure. Keep it going. I might have already done it, unfortunately. Hi, Linus."
9450920,9454760," Oh, there might be some in potential. Let's have a look. I'm skipping through things as well."
9454760,9460040," We'll find something. We'll find something. I can answer this one. There's one in potential,"
9460040,9464840," I guess. Will there ever be another scrapyard worse? I'll put that as a probably not."
9464840,9472040," There is none planned right now. I would say it's unlikely. I learned a long time ago that it's a"
9472040,9478840," little bit of a danger noodle to be steadfast with certain things because the internet will try to"
9478840,9485720," hold you to it. But I'll say, yeah, pretty hard, probably not. It kind of ran its course, guys."
9485720,9492760," I love it as well. But we've kind of done everything that's going to be really interesting."
9492760,9496760," And we would pretty much have to change hosts because Linus is way too recognizable."
9496760,9504440," Yeah, it would just change a lot. I've got one here that you could probably answer."
9505000,9512680," An anon. \"Align your moral compass. My wife works for kids' help phone. Due to high demand,"
9512680,9522520," they do not always get convos reccquired, recorded, recc, recc. Do you think using a supervised AI"
9522520,9529800," chat board will fill the gap? Would it be right?\" And I had no idea. Yeah. What is this thing even?"
9530360,9536360," It's rack phone? What is that? It's a kid's help phone. It's kids' help phone. What is that, though?"
9536360,9542680," I think that's like your child. You call the help phone and you get help or advice. Is it like,"
9542680,9547560," \"Hello, I am in danger?\" I think so. Or is it like, \"Hello, how do I make a peanut butter and jam sandwich?\""
9547560,9556360," Confidential, anonymous and free. It's like online and telephone counseling and volunteer-led"
9556360,9561160," text-based support in English. Yeah, I don't think these technologies are ready for that yet."
9561160,9569560," The potential for harm there is extreme. So, let's"
9569560,9579160," not take the money that we make with them and fund kids' help phone. Yeah, it seems like a good"
9579160,9585080," thing to fund. The reason why I'm kind of dragging here is because it seems not good to not answer"
9585080,9589000," them. But I wouldn't want to drive them down a wrong path with an AI that's promising. This looks"
9589000,9596680," promising. Maybe a smart FAQ where it could only spit out answers that were pre-written. Something"
9596680,9602520," like that. No dice, but I do think we're on the right track because I remember plugging into a splitter"
9602520,9609480," so that we could all use the same output. And probably it's still plugged into that,"
9609480,9613160," sitting in the writer's bin for that project or something. Was this when I was there? Was that"
9613160,9618840," bad video? No, different video. Okay, yep. Okay, here's another one for me. Adam,"
9618840,9625080," hey-oh, Luke and Linus. Happy Friday. What's your favorite feature of any car you've owned?"
9625080,9634280," P.S. Any ETA on the Linus new car, rap review, reveal. Reveal video. We shot it today. Oh no."
9634280,9637720," New rap? It's bad. There's a new rap? I saw it today."
9639560,9643560," Did you write it? How bad is it? Oh no, not that kind of rap, like a vinyl rap."
9643560,9649320," Look how disappointed he is. I assure you- The channel is at least so much less interesting."
9649320,9655400," I assure you it's funnier than any rap that I would write. Are you sure? Do you think I would find"
9655400,9661640," it funnier? It's pretty bad. Okay. It is ridiculous. Okay, I'm a little excited then. Yeah."
9661640,9667160," I would have been more excited if you wrote a rap. I wouldn't look at a place in this track suit"
9667720,9675080," with chains getting out of that car. That's fun. Is it like digital camo or something?"
9675080,9679400," You'll have to see it. I'll show you after it's cringe."
9679400,9687800," Yeah, anywho, what were we talking about again? What's your favorite car feature?"
9687800,9694680," Oh, my favorite car feature of any car that you have owned. Probably the go pedal. The go-"
9696600,9701080," Why you gotta be like an asshole about it? Just answer the question."
9701080,9707880," I've only owned two cars. Okay, my dad drove a New Yorker when I was a kid."
9707880,9714680," And every time we had one of those- Yuri New Yorker? Your New Yorker bro?"
9714680,9720040," I have 1972, I think it was. Okay, I had no idea how obscure and like weird the cars my dad drove"
9720040,9726120," when I was a kid were. He also had an MG convertible. Whoa. Like, whoa. White with the green stripe,"
9726120,9731160," and I'm sitting here going like apparently that was a super cool car and I just had no idea at the"
9731160,9739000," time. Anyway, my dad drove a New Yorker and one of the features on it, so this is in the mid 90s,"
9739000,9746760," right? One of the features on it that just our early 90s maybe that just tickled me so much."
9746760,9751320," Like it was kind of way ahead of its time in a number of ways. It had a digital speedometer,"
9751320,9759320," for example, instead of like a needle, which blew my mind at the time and it talked to you."
9759320,9766440," Okay? So if, for example, I got in and I didn't manage to get the door closed all the way,"
9766440,9771000," instead of beeping or like having a little light that flashed up, it had a voice that said,"
9771000,9779000," \"A door is a jar.\" And the first time I heard it, it's one of those like childhood memories,"
9779000,9784040," right? The first time I heard it, I was with one of my friends, okay? Axel, if you're out there,"
9784040,9789640," sup. Okay? I was with one of my friends and we both just lost it."
9789640,9792040," - Of course. - A door's a jar."
9792040,9794360," - A door's a door you dumb f***."
9794360,9800280," - You have to, because the first time you hear that, it sounds crazy. Yeah, of course."
9800280,9807000," That totally makes sense. - So that was, I mean, to call that my favorite feature of any car I've"
9807000,9810600," ever owned, I think would be a bit of a stretch. - Most amusing feature, maybe."
9810600,9816840," - But it's probably the one that I enjoyed the most in the moment. A door is a jar."
9816840,9823480," Oh man, oh, f***, love it. Apparently, like comedians have done bits on this and stuff."
9823480,9827720," Okay, I had no idea. I thought I was just a eight-year-old being amused by my car."
9827720,9832520," I mean, yeah, I missed my stick shift from my Civic, that was for sure."
9832520,9835960," - Not surprised. - Man, I don't know."
9835960,9845400," Android Auto is pretty great. It's a really boring feature. Honestly, like, car features."
9845400,9849640," - I do find it hilarious how you have trouble calling, like, Yvonne,"
9849640,9856120," using your thing, and my car has no problem calling anyone, because it doesn't do any internet stuff."
9856120,9858280," - Yeah. - It's just local search."
9858280,9866120," Whatever they had in 2009, can search my local directory faster and more accurately than Google"
9866120,9870680," voice can, which is so funny. Like, if I need to call my girlfriend, it's immediate."
9870680,9876040," There's no mess around. Yes, I have to, like, either import it manually for my phone or enter it"
9876040,9881080," manually, which I never do. I just import it for my phone. But it still works. It imports from my"
9881080,9886360," modern phone properly, so, like, I don't care. Through Bluetooth, everything, like, it's, I don't"
9886360,9894120," know. It's fine. - I love the backup camera on my Volt. It is so, so much better than the"
9894120,9900600," Taycan. It's so much better than the Odyssey. It's better than any other car that I have ever"
9900600,9908200," driven. It's just zero BS. I can always see out of it. The lines are actually accurate for where"
9908200,9916200," my wheels will go, and it is mind-blowing to me that other cars can't do it that well. I mean,"
9916200,9921800," honestly, honestly, how hard is it for you guys to do a calibration routine with the car"
9921800,9928280," and be like, \"Okay, we'll hear this. Okay, check. I don't know, pressure sensors on the floor,"
9928280,9935880," whatever. Just guess and check for all I care, but it should be accurate.\" And, like, honestly,"
9935880,9940840," the new car is, like, a mess. The proximity sensors go off. I have the proximity sensor go"
9940840,9947880," off, like, in traffic sometimes. If I, if I just, I'm not, I'm not that close. Chill, bra."
9947880,9953080," There's a, there's a comment in, uh, in full-plane chat from Neko Kwen,"
9953080,9960280," Net, Netcho, Schwend. Oh, man. Sorry. I don't know. That said, Luke's 2009 car is more advanced"
9960280,9966520," in my 2012 car. This was actually a problem. Um, I don't know if you remember this. Maybe you do."
9966520,9972520," We tried to do a progression of car technology video. Oh. And we were going to use- I vaguely"
9972520,9977320," remember that. We were going to use my car and we were working with a car manufacturer so that"
9977320,9983640," they could send us like, uh, equivalent tier car from them. It was a different company, though. Yeah."
9983640,9987960," And we were going to show them like, \"Look, it's, it's been four years. This is all the"
9987960,9993240," progression that has been made.\" Yeah. Cameras are better and this and that and like- And it was worse"
9993240,10001080," in every measurable way. And then mutually, we just decided like, I guess we won't do this video."
10001080,10006360," Yeah. That was amazing. Question mark and just moved on. Yeah, that was it. I don't know."
10006360,10012680," It was an equivalent to your car. It was as expensive as if you bought the same model of"
10012680,10021000," my car, but, but new. Um, it was just, I don't know. It was weird. I was, I was pretty- As a, as a"
10021000,10027080," like computer tech guy, not a car tech guy, I was pretty surprised. Um, but since then I-"
10027080,10031400," Because I think things would get better. Yeah. Since then I am not as surprised. Now we know."
10031400,10039400," Yep. Okay. This one here's from Ernest. Hey Linus, I know you're a water cooling PC fan."
10039400,10048120," If you ever made a water hard line toolkit, what would you include that current kits don't include"
10048120,10058520," or have? Huh. Um, what would I include? Man, I don't know. I like fittings that don't hurt your"
10058520,10063640," fingers when you're trying to do them up. I don't think I have any brilliant ideas for that. I mean,"
10063640,10069080," honestly, I would try to avoid any bends whatsoever. You know what? Here. I would try to include this."
10069080,10076200," I would love to, uh, this is like so early that someone's gonna- Ah, it's a really good idea. You"
10076200,10082120," know what? Maybe I shouldn't talk about this. I declined to answer your question. I have a really"
10082120,10088360," good idea for a water cooling product and it's the kind of thing that the smart business thing to do"
10088360,10094440," would probably be to design it, patent it, and release it. It's a- it's a pretty cool product idea."
10094440,10100040," And the idea- the- the goal of it would be to make hard line water cooling a lot easier by"
10100040,10104840," simplifying the process of doing all the bends and cutting all the lengths. Um, I don't think it's"
10104840,10108680," something that someone else will do, but if they do, then great. I'll- I'll just tell you guys at the"
10108680,10112600," time, but it's a- it's a pretty solid idea and I've already sent it over to the Krita Warehouse team."
10112600,10120280," Cool. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Try to be very open with you guys. Okay, this one's from Mark. Maybe"
10120280,10124680," I'll answer this one. Uh, thank you for your videos getting me into computers. I'm studying"
10124680,10130760," data science at the US Air Force Academy and find military tech fascinating, especially fly by"
10130760,10138360," wire computers. Have you ever considered covering military tech on LTT or if not, why not? It's hard."
10138360,10142200," I mean, that's like the whole point. Well, you want- you want to check out a data center of"
10142200,10148360," play stations and a shipping container? Well, okay. Like, it's tough. It's not designed to"
10148360,10152520," necessarily be cutting edge in the way that we think about things being cutting edge. It's"
10152520,10157960," cutting edge and like, uh, this will definitely still be working if it's buried in mud for six months"
10157960,10162040," and someone walks along and picks it up and is the person who's supposed to be using it. Like,"
10162040,10169000," it's- it's a really- it's a really different kind of, um, design intent, military technology,"
10169000,10173160," and any of the stuff that really is like cutting edge the way we would think about it in terms of"
10173160,10177080," you anyways. Processing power. Yeah, I would have absolutely no access to whatsoever and if I did,"
10177080,10182120," they'd have to kill me. So, uh, there's just not really much for us to say. Or it'll end up on the"
10182120,10187720," worth under forms. Yeah, or that. Yeah, if you want, if you want to follow it, just hang out on the"
10187720,10194040," worth under forms. There was- there was someone who tweet, oh, no, I don't even want to talk with"
10194040,10198840," this. Okay. Okay. I'll interrupt to you with another question. This one's from Weston. Hey,"
10198840,10204920," Linus and Luke, been loving the videos dash WAN lately with so many businesses moving online"
10204920,10210120," these days. Do you think brick and mortar tech stores are a thing of the past or is there still"
10210120,10214200," a need for these establishments? Oh, absolutely. You still need brick and mortar, right? Like it's-"
10214200,10220520," retail foot traffic has increased double digit percentage. People- people want to see things"
10220520,10225400," before they buy and more importantly, I think people want that instant gratification. Like,"
10225400,10232760," I- I wanted an RGB, addressable RGB strip for some reason. Now, super frustrated that I couldn't"
10232760,10238760," just like go and buy it. And okay, something that, um, that I'm doing right now is I want to paint"
10238760,10245080," my helmet and my bike to match. And I didn't want to- I didn't want to just like learn about paint"
10245080,10249880," online in order something online and hope that it's good. I wanted a personal touch. So I found a"
10249880,10255880," local like automotive paint supplier went in. They were super nice and talks to me and explained"
10255880,10259880," stuff and they mixed up some samples for me free of charge so that I could play around with them"
10259880,10263640," in the gun and kind of see what I like and see what works and what doesn't. And that's just"
10263640,10267640," something that you're not going to get online. Even with really good online customer service,"
10267640,10274280," you can't have that- that immediate back and forth. This is from the previous topic and I'll"
10274280,10278040," jump back on what you just said in a second. But, uh, Gibberim and Floatplain Chat said,"
10278040,10285080," \"I work in a defense contracting company. In the last year, I designed a new 1394B, aka"
10285080,10293400," Firewire board.\" Yeah. Yeah. It's not necessary. It's a different kind of a thing. But,"
10294280,10297400," yeah, I don't know. I like brick and mortar as well. If I have a brick and mortar option,"
10297400,10302440," I'll pretty much always take it. One of my issues with brick and mortar as it is right now,"
10302440,10308200," when there's something that I haven't bought a lot of, I don't know where to go."
10308200,10313720," Yeah, it's tough. Like it's better like just random like household things."
10313720,10317800," Yeah. Where do you go for like a whisk? I don't know. Exactly. Yeah. Not William Sonoma. I'll"
10317800,10321880," tell you that much. I don't even know what that is. Yeah. I talked about it on Wensho recently,"
10321880,10326280," but it was the place that we got the blender from for our wedding that we went in. I remember that."
10326280,10330280," Like, you know, $400 and walked out with like some cookie cutters and like... Yeah, I know the"
10330280,10334760," blender story. Yeah. For me, traditionally, I've always gone to like, what is it? Just like"
10334760,10339320," Shoppers Drug Mart. Oh, yeah. Canadian Tire. Yeah. Just go to Canadian Tire. Yeah, but there's"
10339320,10345080," stuff other. And it's like seasonal too. It's like, no, but I want that now. And it's like, oh,"
10345080,10350600," well, you know, it's hot now, but you know, it will be cold soon, so we don't have any of those"
10350600,10355160," anymore. Yeah. I mean, I get it, but thank you. Well, you want a pitcher? Well, we only carry those"
10355160,10360200," in the summer because people make more pitcher drinks in the summer, I guess. No, I need a pitcher"
10360200,10367880," now. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. This is always... Apparently, it is coming back,"
10367880,10372360," actually. I know, again. It doesn't need to come back. No, it really doesn't. Just like Target didn't"
10372360,10377480," need to come here. We don't have a shortage of places where you can get like random household"
10377480,10384360," appliance, or not appliances, but like random housewares for not even great prices. I think it's"
10384360,10391400," really good. It's like Canada is not some like wasteland with, you know, no options for getting a"
10391400,10396920," whisk. We have a lot fewer, but they exist. Yeah, they're there. Just because Luke can't find them"
10396920,10401000," doesn't mean they don't exist. Oh, 100%. The guy doesn't know how to buy things, big surprise."
10401000,10406680," Yeah. He doesn't buy things. Yes. I could find a whisk. Yeah. This is the... This is the problem."
10406680,10411000," Like, I'm not trying to cover it up as something else. I don't know where to go."
10411000,10419560," All right. I've actually been like musing about this idea, and I'm not going to make it because I"
10419560,10423720," know I'm the only one that would benefit from it, but like some type of thing where it's like,"
10423720,10428920," I want to brick and... I want this thing to tell me where I can buy this type of item in my local"
10428920,10435160," area. Yeah. I think that'd be super cool. I want a brick and mortar alternative. Top Gear 1224 says,"
10435160,10439560," hey, you need to be nice to Target Canada. It was a vibe. Yeah. The issue with Target Canada,"
10439560,10444680," as I think the same issue that almost everyone who's tried to come up into Canada, maybe Home Depot"
10444680,10449960," and Walmart were reasonably successful, is they come up here going like, \"Best of all.\" We can bring"
10449960,10456200," the... Well, they just like bought out future shop. Like, I don't know. Competition delete. Yeah."
10456200,10462680," Future shop kind of like made their own grave by just not adapting, but I feel like a lot of the"
10462680,10471160," more commodity stores that have tried to come up here and compete have assumed that they can bring"
10471160,10477320," their supply chain management and their economies of scale into Canada, and it will work just as well"
10477320,10483480," as it does in the US. But the issue is that if you come in with this strategy of building megastores"
10483480,10491160," and trying to just leverage economies of scale, you're going to run into problems because Canada"
10491160,10499400," logistically is really different from the US. We're enormous. The population is spread out extremely,"
10499400,10506200," extremely far, but like horizontally essentially, but then you still... You know, when you look at"
10506200,10510520," this population number, if you want to access it, you actually have to like spread out a lot,"
10510520,10515240," even though it's in this like tiny strip, like right along the border. And then the big thing is"
10515240,10519160," that it's not very much. Like, there's more people living in the state of California than there are"
10519160,10524600," in the entire country of Canada. And so what works there where you just plonk down a big box store,"
10524600,10529480," like man, the foot traffic in micro center when I was down there blew my mind. I'm thinking,"
10529480,10535400," how many are hard to this many people who need a computer right now? Like just just blew me away,"
10535400,10539160," right? That concept genuinely confused me for a really long time. I would see certain stores..."
10539160,10544760," How does fries electronics exist? I would see certain stores in movies and my American friends"
10544760,10548280," would talk about going to certain stores and I'd be like, how do they pay the rent? Like,"
10548280,10550440," how is there people shopping from here? I was just like, oh,"
10550440,10557640," so what happens is they come up here and figure out, oh, holy crap, our overhead is like really high"
10557640,10563080," and the volumes are really low. So while we identified this potential for us to come in and"
10563080,10568920," undercut these Canadian idiots who are charging so much, actually, in order for us to survive here,"
10568920,10574120," we have to charge the same amount that they do because everything costs so much to operate here."
10574120,10579960," Oh, like Newegg, if NCIX hadn't completely eaten its own tail, Newegg's Canadian"
10579960,10583960," launch was disastrous. It was terrible. They just had no idea what they were doing."
10583960,10591240," Can you ask too soon fries? Sorry, everyone. Can you ask Bing chat? Oh, sure. Where to buy a"
10591240,10597960," whisk in like, Colverdale? Sure. Something? Or something like that? I don't know."
10599560,10606680," Let's go with spatula. Sure. Let's patula. Where's a good place to buy a spatula near me?"
10606680,10611720," Near me. Does it have locations or? I don't know. Let's find out. Yeah. Let's go."
10611720,10620120," And I don't move around locations literally on Google. I have searched the web. You could go to"
10620120,10624600," Walmart Canada, which has a variety of kitchen spatulas and different sizes, shapes and materials."
10624600,10630600," Another option is the Home Depot. Huh. Okay. I guess really Home Depot spatulas."
10630600,10635800," Would it be like plaster spatulas or like barbecue? Oh, no. Okay. Look at that. There's a whole pack"
10635800,10642600," of spatulas for $29 available for pick up. Yep. There you go. All right. One thing to note is"
10642600,10652200," both of these shops now do online and have it shipped to store. Free delivery on orders over"
10652200,10656280," $49. You can pick up your order nearby store. But if you wanted one tonight,"
10656280,10661960," they might not have it at the store. Yeah. So you can just go there. It also picks two gigantic"
10661960,10669000," chains and didn't find any of the like smaller, more interesting shops. Trais and Terasan. All right."
10669000,10677960," Hey, baby. Okay. Oh, those are incoming. Hold on. This is from Jacqueline. Does AMD sponsorship for"
10677960,10683640," ultimate tech upgrade mean upgrade recipients won't be able to pick NVIDIA GPUs anymore?"
10683640,10690280," Or will it just be that one of the components must be AMD? I don't know. That's a good question,"
10690280,10695800," and I will have to get an answer for you on that maybe in one of the videos. I mean, I guess you'll"
10695800,10700760," see if there's an NVIDIA GPU. I wouldn't blame AMD if they were like, hey, we'd really prefer"
10700760,10707640," a few Radeon GPUs. Yeah, I wouldn't either. But also, I think that giving them too much"
10707640,10713560," influence over the part selection is going to hurt the integrity of the project. Like,"
10713560,10717800," with Intel, the only requirement was that we had to use some Intel something. So hopefully,"
10717800,10722440," we've negotiated a similar deal. So I guess we'll have to see. Okay. This one's from Trevor."
10722440,10728520," Hey, Linus just wanted to say I've been a huge fan since about 2012 to 2013, and I'm snatching"
10728520,10733400," up the tracksuit right now. Do you have any other plans for different color schemes such as white"
10733400,10738520," as the main color and black stripes? I think we'd like to do other color schemes, but that's going"
10738520,10745320," to be dependent on the success of the classic black with the white stripe. Okay, got one here"
10745320,10748520," from Anonymous. This one's kind of, yeah, I don't think the other ones would sell"
10748520,10757160," anywhere near as well. I want the white to be LTT orange. Yeah, like that one might do okay."
10757720,10761160," But I would hazard against making too many of them personally."
10761160,10766040," Okay, now got one here from Anonymous. I could see us doing limited edition ones once in a while"
10766040,10770600," or something like that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We've got the pattern all sorted out. Same material as"
10770600,10777560," the gold plushie. Or you could do the white becomes what you wrapped your car in. Oh, you haven't"
10777560,10781800," seen it yet. Yeah, I know I haven't. No. Okay. I want a gold plushie tracksuit."
10782600,10787480," And like gold. All right, keep it going. All right, going to Anonymous. You mentioned the celebrity"
10787480,10792520," component of your life. Do you agree with the anecdotal story about Eminem who made a statement"
10792520,10798440," to his daughter's high school that when he was at school, he was Marshall. But if he's outside,"
10798440,10803080," he's Eminem, please respect that. I don't even know what he's talking about."
10803080,10807560," So I get it like in what way like we referred to as Marshall."
10809000,10813800," He doesn't want to be known as his artist's handle when he's dealing with his or his child's"
10813800,10819320," education dad at school. Oh, I kind of thought it was like the other way around. I thought he's"
10819320,10825880," like, if you see me outside, call me Eminem, respect that. I thought it was the I sorry, I see what"
10825880,10829880," you mean now. I thought it was like the other way and I'm sitting here going like, that was weird."
10829880,10834840," Yeah, like who cares? Like if you know people personally and you see them outside of that context"
10834840,10838280," in which you know them what you all of a sudden you're not on a first name basis anymore. That"
10838280,10842040," was the way I took it. And that's probably not right. I think he's just trying to be professional."
10842040,10847160," It makes sense to me. Yeah. Okay. I think it would be a little weird if like the teacher of my child"
10847160,10852680," was like, yo, slick. Yeah, no. Yeah, that's not cool. No. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."
10852680,10858200," Yeah. That makes total sense to me. I've never really had to deal with that. Well, your name is"
10858200,10862760," the company name. So much would be impossible. Mr. Tipps. Well, no, I'm talking to you at school."
10862760,10867000," You call me Linus. When you see me out of the street, you also call me Linus. Please respect that."
10867000,10875000," Thank you for that. He talks just like that. I mean more in terms of like"
10875000,10878280," I don't do interpretations. You should hear like my my mom."
10878280,10886920," Impersonations, but yes. What do I say? Interpretation. I'm interpreting for you. I'll do"
10886920,10895160," interpretations. That was much more like it. Yeah. It's late man, whatever."
10895160,10902840," Yeah, I've never really run into a situation where like a teacher or anything dealing with my kids"
10902840,10906200," really knows who I am yet. So I guess we'll cross that bridge when we get to it. Yeah."
10906200,10911160," But I would yeah, I would expect them to just call me Linus and treat me totally normally."
10911160,10918280," That's that's that's what I would hope for. Okay, and this last one's from Ryan before we move"
10918280,10929080," on to potentials. Any updates on Luke's crowbar? Do you know the update? Well, I know an update."
10929080,10931720," You know, I don't know if I can say it though. Like I actually don't think I can."
10931720,10938280," The update is that Nick has forbidden me to talk about the coal bar. He is forbidden me."
10938280,10942520," Oh, get owned. Yeah. Are you allowed to talk about the coal bar? I don't know. But I"
10942520,10946200," presume the information that I currently know I would not be allowed to talk about."
10946200,10950040," Can you mute us for a second? Oh, that's dangerous. No, no, we got this."
10950040,10955480," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we got this. Wow, I don't like."
10955480,10958920," I don't like."
10958920,10988720," (silence)"
10988720,10991320," Nick and I are growing out talking about it that was?"
10991320,10992320," Oh, I see."
10992320,10993320," But like, hmm."
10993320,11000880," Okay, well, I will have to check in with Mr. Nick Light and I would, except that I accidentally"
11000880,11006680," left my phone on with Team Vira Open and my battery drained because my screen didn't"
11006680,11009880," dim and so my phone is dead."
11009880,11011440," So I can't call him now."
11011440,11014640," Do you want me to call him?"
11014640,11016760," I mean, sure."
11016760,11018080," But let's do both of those things."
11018080,11020200," Dan, do you mind throwing my phone on the charger?"
11020200,11021200," Thank you."
11021200,11022600," And Luke, yeah, but I mean, we'll call him."
11022600,11023600," It's pretty late."
11023600,11024600," Whatever."
11024600,11025600," He's not going to be asleep."
11025600,11026600," Okay."
11026600,11027600," Brose a gamer."
11027600,11029400," Get real."
11029400,11034040," Podcast with no sound is going to be interesting, says H.A. in the flow plane chat."
11034040,11035040," Okay."
11035040,11036040," Yeah."
11036040,11037040," Hello."
11037040,11039560," Hi, this is Luke."
11039560,11040560," (laughter)"
11040560,11041640," Hi, Luke."
11041640,11044560," What's going on?"
11044560,11051560," We're on Wedge Show Derr."
11051560,11053560," Wow."
11053560,11054560," Wow."
11054560,11056480," Hey, so the--"
11056480,11063960," Good interpretation."
11063960,11070520," So anyway, the peeps asked for an update on the coal bar and Luke wasn't sure if he's"
11070520,11072800," allowed to share what you told him."
11072800,11079120," So does he have a sign off on that or where we're at on that?"
11079120,11080680," We're talking to them."
11080680,11082320," That's about all we can say."
11082320,11083320," Okay."
11083320,11084320," All right."
11084320,11085320," Okay."
11085320,11086320," Thanks."
11086320,11087320," Okay."
11087320,11088320," Bye-bye."
11088320,11089320," Okay."
11089320,11090320," You have a wonderful evening."
11090320,11091320," Oh, hey, you too."
11091320,11092320," Enjoy the show."
11092320,11093320," Oh, yeah."
11093320,11094320," Oh, yeah."
11094320,11095320," For sure."
11095320,11096320," This is when show after dark, baby."
11096320,11097320," Yeah."
11097320,11098320," This seems to be going very well."
11098320,11099320," GONE sexual."
11099320,11100320," Okay."
11100320,11101320," Bye-bye."
11101320,11102320," Okay."
11102320,11104360," There you have it."
11104360,11108360," One Mr. Nick Light has not given us the go ahead to talk about any of that."
11108360,11109560," All right, Dan, hit us."
11109560,11110720," Yeah, I thought that was the case."
11110720,11111720," Okay."
11111720,11112720," We're into potentials now."
11112720,11119000," Billy is asking, \"Hey, Luke, Linus, and Dan, what is everyone's favorite/dream car?"
11119000,11121120," Will we get a video on Linus' new car?\""
11121120,11126880," I liked the Ramek Navera until I found out Andrew Tate had one."
11126880,11131080," Now I'm just like, \"Well, apparently that's a car for douchebags.\""
11131080,11134680," And this is coming from someone sitting here in a tracksuit."
11134680,11135680," Not exercising."
11135680,11136920," With a wrapped car outside."
11136920,11137920," You made."
11137920,11138920," That I made."
11138920,11141080," It's not just your tracksuit."
11141080,11142520," It's your tracksuit."
11142520,11146760," I actually can't remember the exact name of it, but I think I showed you it because I"
11146760,11149400," like thought it was cool and forza."
11149400,11150400," Ooh."
11150400,11155240," Yeah, I actually remember this interaction, but I do not remember the car."
11155240,11157200," No, and I'm not going to remember it either."
11157200,11158840," I didn't expect you to remember it to be clear."
11158840,11161880," Let's go with something cool like a 94 Dodge Viper."
11161880,11164040," A 94 Dodge Viper."
11164040,11170680," Now if we're going retro, it was always the Super B. Charger Super B."
11170680,11173120," I loved that car."
11173120,11176880," But I mean, it's kind of a boat, so it would probably kind of suck to drive around these"
11176880,11177880," days."
11177880,11183280," I want to curl a GR if there was a car that I'd love to just rip around in these days."
11183280,11185120," That would be sick."
11185120,11187080," I always thought the NSX was pretty cool."
11187080,11188680," Chris McWinney brings up a good point."
11188680,11191680," Andrew Tate doesn't have any cars now, so..."
11191680,11192680," Free game!"
11192680,11196520," Well, he thought it was cool at one point."
11196520,11198400," Does that ruin it?"
11198400,11200000," Yeah, probably."
11200000,11201000," I can run it."
11201000,11202000," 3,200 megahertz."
11202000,11203000," Oh, my goodness."
11203000,11204000," 3,200 megahertz."
11204000,11205480," It says, \"Slav culture is not douchey.\""
11205480,11209640," Not everyone who wears a tracksuit is a slab and plenty of people who wear tracksuits"
11209640,11210640," are douchey."
11210640,11211640," So they're not..."
11211640,11216520," We're not drawing overlapping circles here, is my point."
11216520,11219200," There's tracksuit stereotypes that are far outside of..."
11219200,11221200," And that have nothing to do with slab culture."
11221200,11222200," Yeah."
11222200,11223200," Yeah."
11223200,11224200," I do."
11224200,11227360," The pictures on the LTT store were definitely fairly pointed in that direction."
11227360,11228560," Yeah, but not all of them."
11228560,11230520," I think that was just people having fun with it."
11230520,11231520," Yeah."
11231520,11232520," Yeah."
11232520,11234280," Okay, next one here's from Annette."
11234280,11235920," \"Pouring went out for Brandon."
11235920,11237320," Nearly 10 years."
11237320,11240760," Linus and Luke, what were your favorite memories with B-roll, man?\""
11240760,11242160," Oh, that's tough."
11242160,11247440," I mean, one that comes to mind, \"Ah.\""
11247440,11249920," As I think of one, they're like..."
11249920,11252560," It's starting to hammer in."
11252560,11255160," Yeah, they're coming fast, right?"
11255160,11257160," Like, \"Ah.\""
11257160,11263160," While you think about that, we had a lunch to talk about it on the day that he departed."
11263160,11264760," And I was good, man."
11264760,11269000," I showed up in high spirits and we were joking the whole time and everything was all positive"
11269000,11270200," and everything was good."
11270200,11272200," And then he made his tweet about how he's leaving."
11272200,11274120," I was like, \"I should probably respond to this.\""
11274120,11276240," And then I didn't for a while."
11276240,11280000," Then I finally was like, \"Okay, I need to respond to this, I think.\""
11280000,11282440," So I started trying to dig through old photos."
11282440,11284440," And that started to hit pretty hard."
11284440,11292400," I didn't cry until right before Wanshow."
11292400,11296040," And it was the last time I'd seen them in uniform."
11296040,11299640," You know, like, didn't have to be uniform, but it was the end of the day."
11299640,11303600," I think it does help that when we met up on his last day, it was outside of work."
11303600,11306760," If I had to see him leave the building, that would probably be."
11306760,11308440," Yeah, well, that's pretty big."
11308440,11311000," It was on his way out the door."
11311000,11315280," And it didn't help that when I walked out, Yvonne's face was already like, tear stained."
11315280,11318520," And I was like, \"Oh, it's goodbye time.\""
11318520,11320000," Yeah."
11320000,11323120," Man, what is there to..."
11323120,11324120," I know what mine is."
11324120,11329000," Yeah, what is there to not reflect on?"
11329000,11334040," I mean, how about that wild..."
11334040,11337440," I don't know, like..."
11337440,11338440," You know what could be..."
11338440,11341320," I can feel mine, if you need time to think."
11341320,11347080," I don't know, it's probably easier for me to just verbal diarrhea them out, right?"
11347080,11352120," Because like, you know, I remember him..."
11352120,11357000," I remember so many times telling him to stop bringing his own equipment to work and him"
11357000,11359320," insisting because he just wanted things to be better."
11359320,11365280," You know, I remember the first time he worked with us, just clearly thinking we had no idea"
11365280,11370320," what we were doing, but putting up with us anyway, he didn't even get paid for it."
11370320,11375000," He was considered OG, even though he didn't start working here until four or five months"
11375000,11382520," in because he actually did do something for us before the company formally started working."
11382520,11388440," I'll always remember the fight he had with me when I like tried to get him to stop at"
11388440,11392920," seven B roll shots, like back in the Langley House, and he was like, \"No, it needs more."
11392920,11393920," It has to be better.\""
11393920,11397560," I'm like, \"Dude, it's like 7.30 and like, Taren needs to go home."
11397560,11398560," He's editing this video."
11398560,11399560," He can't leave till it's done."
11399560,11401520," Like, you have to stop shooting.\""
11401520,11405320," You know, like, I remember those marathon build guide shoots, man."
11405320,11409080," It was always me and Brandon, just marathon build guide shoots."
11409080,11413880," We would start as early as we could and we would end when we landed ended."
11413880,11420320," You know, the late nights, you know, just chatting on trips, like, we traveled the world"
11420320,11421320," together, right?"
11421320,11427640," Like, that's something that is a little different from, I think, most coworker interactions."
11427640,11430480," Yeah, love Brandon forever."
11430480,11434320," Like, there's no HR response here."
11434320,11437400," Like, we're good, don't worry."
11437400,11440720," And if anything, I hope we get closer."
11440720,11446720," Yeah, I'm not saying anything that I haven't already said to him personally."
11446720,11450280," Like, I'm not just trying to, you know, make a video about it or whatever."
11450280,11452880," I wasn't really even going to bring it up."
11452880,11455840," Just because, like, our official policy is that we don't really acknowledge this stuff"
11455840,11456840," anymore."
11456840,11461800," We don't talk about HR-related issues, but Brandon's not a human resource."
11461800,11463680," Brandon's more of a friend."
11463680,11467800," And I don't mean that personally for, like, anyone else."
11467800,11469560," I'm not saying you're not a friend."
11469560,11473520," I'm just saying that as a founding member of the company, I think it's probably okay"
11473520,11475240," for me to acknowledge his departure."
11475240,11481080," Yeah, there's certain things that get when you're literally day zero, there's certain"
11481080,11482480," things that are a little special."
11482480,11483480," Yeah."
11483480,11492920," Mine is the first Computex trip because I like new Brandon, but at the first Computex"
11492920,11495200," trip, the B team was formed."
11495200,11496200," The B team."
11496200,11498680," Which was like, and that was a..."
11498680,11499680," Sorry."
11499680,11501840," We did actually call them the B team."
11501840,11504400," Yeah, well, it's basically on that..."
11504400,11506660," That was still when things were..."
11506660,11512760," Things have been Cinqr Swim quite a few times, but that was when it was like..."
11512760,11514040," It was scary."
11514040,11518680," Cinqr Swim and you have lots of added weight stangling from you."
11518680,11522120," And I had barely hosted anything."
11522120,11523120," Yeah."
11523120,11524120," Like..."
11524120,11526120," You're kind of thrown to the wolves, but I was stuck."
11526120,11529720," I had to do all the stupid sponsored things for WD."
11529720,11531960," Like, it was a really rough trip."
11531960,11534880," I had never done a show of any kind."
11534880,11539000," And I had basically never hosted anything."
11539000,11541960," Most of my experience at that point was a WAN show, which is pretty much as far away"
11541960,11544280," from live content as you could possibly get."
11544280,11548960," But I had been around this guy for a while and like, I don't know, whatever."
11548960,11553960," And Linus was like, \"Alright, it's Linus and Eddzel versus Luke and Brandon.\""
11553960,11556560," And that was probably the smartest thing you could have done at that point in time."
11556560,11559080," Because he made it like this war."
11559080,11561200," And I was like, \"Well, f*** this."
11561200,11563520," It's Brandon and I, we have to figure this out."
11563520,11565160," We have to do this well.\""
11565160,11567960," And like, no one knows who the hell I am."
11567960,11571960," So I'm just showing up to Booth's being like, \"I swear I'm a part of this channel.\""
11571960,11576000," Like, \"Can we please make these videos?\""
11576000,11579840," And Brandon completely matched my energy."
11579840,11582800," And I know I can be like a little hardcore sometimes."
11582800,11590240," So when people do match my energy, it's really uncommon that a bond is not formed."
11590240,11595080," And he matched my energy then and then matched my energy every single time we ever did a"
11595080,11597760," road trip for the many years beyond there."
11597760,11600120," And we like were the road team at one point in time."
11600120,11605960," We were the only people that did remote coverage unless it was like something really special."
11605960,11612200," And that was like, I don't know, just Brandon and I did everything together for a long time."
11612200,11617000," I think one of the reasons why the closure is probably easier for me is my kind of departure"
11617000,11621640," to floatplane was kind of the disconnection of that team already."
11621640,11622640," You left him."
11622640,11623640," He didn't leave you."
11623640,11624640," Basically."
11624640,11625640," Yeah."
11625640,11626640," So like, yeah."
11626640,11630280," No, Brandon did not die."
11630280,11633760," He's alive and very well."
11633760,11635760," Thrive, and yeah."
11635760,11636760," All right."
11636760,11641520," I don't know what to follow that with."
11641520,11642920," I was something a little bit lighter."
11642920,11643920," Hold on one second."
11643920,11646440," What if I derail us back to the dock for a quick second?"
11646440,11650640," Because people keep on shouting out that we've missed a topic."
11650640,11651840," Oh, yeah."
11651840,11654080," We missed a boring one, I think."
11654080,11657040," What about the underwear topic?"
11657040,11660880," Oh, we never talked about it."
11660880,11662240," We didn't talk about that."
11662240,11663240," Yeah."
11663240,11668240," The audience is right."
11668240,11671080," Surely this would have secured the deal."
11671080,11675640," Went home with a guy and he was wearing Linus Tech Tips underwear."
11675640,11676640," Help."
11676640,11684080," Apparently, Leeds Fest is a group for anonymous admissions for the University of Leeds where"
11684080,11689520," an unknown lady and/or gentleman stumbled upon some sweet LTT merch."
11689520,11692280," This was reposted to the LTT Reddit."
11692280,11696480," There's some great comments."
11696480,11697480," Did he drop you?"
11697480,11702080," Should have abruptly ended the date with, \"That's cute.\""
11702080,11704720," Just like this message from our sponsor."
11704720,11708600," What was the question that we had around this?"
11708600,11709600," Oh, yes."
11709600,11710600," Discussion question."
11710600,11712360," Thank you, Wancho writer."
11712360,11716240," Will LTT merch get you laid yes or no?"
11716240,11729240," Even our audience demographics, I think if you are a tracked, give an audience demographics,"
11729240,11736800," if you are a fan of the show and you are attracted to males, probably."
11736800,11738800," Yeah."
11738800,11740760," Outside of that, maybe not."
11740760,11743600," One thing that I find is interesting is they recognize it clearly."
11743600,11744600," Yeah."
11744600,11746200," So that's that okay."
11746200,11748480," That part has been interesting to me the whole time."
11748480,11751760," They were jealous."
11751760,11753760," And they read it."
11753760,11754760," Right?"
11754760,11756240," I mean, I guess."
11756240,11757640," It's on the waistband, though."
11757640,11759800," The new ones are just in a..."
11759800,11761840," Oh, well, rubberized symbol."
11761840,11766640," Okay, they didn't say if it was the text across the waistband or if it was the newer"
11766640,11767640," ones that just have the name."
11767640,11768680," The symbols are more tasty."
11768680,11769680," Rubber stamp."
11769680,11770680," Yeah."
11770680,11774920," Should we pull it?"
11774920,11780040," It is pulling our audience, which is not entirely fair, but I think we should do it anyways."
11780040,11781040," Would you be..."
11781040,11782040," So what is the question?"
11782040,11784760," Are you more turned on if they have line executives underwear?"
11784760,11785760," Sure."
11785760,11786760," Yeah."
11786760,11787760," Yeah."
11787760,11788760," Yeah."
11788760,11789760," Yeah."
11789760,11790760," Yeah."
11790760,11791760," Yeah."
11791760,11792760," That's what..."
11792760,11796200," I think that's what we need to know."
11796200,11797200," Uh oh."
11797200,11802520," And then 14C in float plane chat says, \"I mean, my wife knows who you guys are."
11802520,11804720," So who was she with then?\""
11804720,11805720," [laughter]"
11805720,11806720," Oh shoot."
11806720,11813400," What time did I set for that?"
11813400,11814400," Are you more turned?"
11814400,11815400," Okay."
11815400,11816400," Well, here."
11816400,11817400," Let's just..."
11817400,11818400," Let's see the results of the poll."
11818400,11819400," I mean..."
11819400,11820400," Yeah."
11820400,11821400," See for our audience, that's what I was saying."
11821400,11822400," Yeah."
11822400,11823400," Yeah."
11823400,11824400," 65% more turned on if they have LTT underwear."
11824400,11825400," Absolutely."
11825400,11826400," Okay."
11826400,11828160," Um, LTT underwear."
11828160,11830320," More likely to turn someone on."
11830320,11832360," If they're also an LTT."
11832360,11833640," Well, yes."
11833640,11835480," But I mean, that's fine."
11835480,11836480," Yeah."
11836480,11837480," Why not?"
11837480,11839520," You already know you have so much in common."
11839520,11840520," Yeah."
11840520,11841520," Alright."
11841520,11842520," Next, uh..."
11842520,11846520," Next marriage message, Dan."
11846520,11848520," Uh, sure."
11848520,11849760," This is from Ryan."
11849760,11854680," Hey Linus and Luke, a long time fan of the show from the Langley House days."
11854680,11857960," What is the one place you haven't traveled to yet that you really want to?"
11857960,11859200," I wanna go to Australia."
11859200,11861720," I wanna go scuba diving in Australia."
11861720,11866160," That sucks because that was literally my exact answer."
11866160,11868440," Don't you cocoed together!"
11868440,11869440," Yeah!"
11869440,11870440," Including the scuba thing."
11870440,11871440," I don't think we've..."
11871440,11872440," Have we?"
11872440,11875080," I don't think we dived in Mexico together."
11875080,11876080," Yeah, we did."
11876080,11877640," I went with Dennis."
11877640,11880400," Oh."
11880400,11882200," I was..."
11882200,11884520," A layer higher?"
11884520,11885520," Oh, that's right."
11885520,11886520," You couldn't go deep."
11886520,11887520," Yeah."
11887520,11888520," I remember."
11888520,11889520," I do now, but I didn't back then."
11889520,11890520," So you were there, but we didn't go together."
11890520,11891520," Yeah."
11891520,11892520," You..."
11892520,11893520," I did the lame one."
11893520,11894520," Your version was not as cool."
11894520,11895520," I watched you guys have fun."
11895520,11896520," Yeah."
11896520,11897520," We really did."
11897520,11898520," It was great guys."
11898520,11903120," It was good enough that it inspired me to like go get my sets and stuff because I enjoyed"
11903120,11906760," my experience and was able to see you guys having more fun."
11906760,11907760," So I was like, \"Well, okay.\""
11907760,11909280," Might as well get my stuff."
11909280,11912280," Our dive was a lot better."
11912280,11913280," Yeah."
11913280,11917440," Diving with Dennis as my dive partner, a little scary."
11917440,11920760," He can be very competent though."
11920760,11921760," Yes."
11921760,11923920," But sometimes he can not."
11923920,11926480," I think I've told this story before."
11926480,11927480," Yeah."
11927480,11929880," There was a trip."
11929880,11931920," I think was it that first Computex trip?"
11931920,11932920," I don't know."
11932920,11933920," I don't remember."
11933920,11937240," You know, it must have been the second one."
11937240,11942760," But Brandon and I went to Taiwan and Dennis was there, but he didn't work with us yet."
11942760,11949880," And this was the first time I had met him."
11949880,11955880," And then when he came to work with us locally in BC, I genuinely had a like, \"What?\""
11955880,11959280," seemed like a totally different person."
11959280,11960280," I don't know what to tell you."
11960280,11961280," I don't know what it is."
11961280,11962880," I don't know what to tell you."
11962880,11963880," I don't know."
11963880,11967480," We have like a new version of Dennis."
11967480,11969280," You haven't dodged the question though."
11969280,11970280," Oh."
11970280,11972360," So I can't say Australia's screw diving?"
11972360,11973360," I mean, you can, but it's like..."
11973360,11975800," They have a cop out."
11975800,11976800," Yeah."
11976800,11979560," Already did Japan."
11979560,11983880," I've been quite privileged through work because I've gone to a lot of the places that I wanted"
11983880,11984880," to go."
11984880,11985880," I always wanted to go to Taiwan."
11985880,11986880," I always wanted to go to Japan."
11986880,11987880," Do you want to go to Korea?"
11987880,11988880," Do South America at all?"
11988880,11992320," What about like, you know, somewhere unconventional, like Antarctica or like..."
11992320,11994160," I'm interested in Antarctica."
11994160,11996320," I've been interested in southern Chile."
11996320,11997320," Okay."
11997320,11998320," Okay."
11998320,12000320," Because there's some like really interesting hiking that's there."
12000320,12001320," Cool."
12001320,12002320," Yeah."
12002320,12005560," I'm going to go into the Nordics up into Iceland."
12005560,12006560," Yeah."
12006560,12008560," I don't know."
12008560,12009560," All right."
12009560,12010560," That's fine."
12010560,12011560," I give up."
12011560,12012560," Okay."
12012560,12013560," Dan, hit us."
12013560,12014560," Oh, okay."
12014560,12016120," This one is from Chidding."
12016120,12017120," Hi, Linus and Luke."
12017120,12018600," Love from Taiwan on."
12018600,12019600," And the..."
12019600,12020600," Oh, you moved it."
12020600,12023280," Love from Taiwan and a Saturday morning."
12023280,12025760," What's your fondest memories visiting Taiwan?"
12025760,12028400," Any food or places that you wish to eat or go against?"
12028400,12029400," I love soup dumplings."
12029400,12030400," Let's go."
12030400,12031560," Oh, and playing badminton."
12031560,12035960," My last trip there, I played seven times in six days."
12035960,12038280," I went hard and shot videos."
12038280,12039440," That was basically all I did."
12039440,12040440," I worked and played badminton."
12040440,12041440," That was it."
12041440,12042440," I remember this."
12042440,12044520," I absolutely loved Taiwan."
12044520,12047280," Ever since the first time we went there, I've pretty much taken a week off every single"
12047280,12052600," time I've gone there to like just hang out there a little bit longer."
12052600,12053600," Fondest memories."
12053600,12054960," I don't know."
12054960,12058120," There's a lot going river tracing in Hualien."
12058120,12060200," I'm sure I butchered that."
12060200,12061200," Yeah."
12061200,12063760," But it's in Eastern Taiwan."
12063760,12067920," But going river tracing there was absolutely amazing."
12067920,12072240," And yeah, I'll just stick with that one."
12072240,12077240," Do you want a minute to go through those or should I pick off some more?"
12077240,12078240," Just start picking them."
12078240,12079240," I don't care."
12079240,12080240," I'll loop convict them."
12080240,12081240," This one's from Ryan."
12081240,12083480," Yo, so happy this was released."
12083480,12086960," I'm going to use this as the Pokemon Playnet."
12086960,12087960," What stealth desk pad?"
12087960,12088960," I think so."
12088960,12089960," Yeah."
12089960,12093040," So that's a product slash video that you are proud to have worked on that doesn't get enough"
12093040,12094040," attention."
12094040,12099920," You know, it's a really cool video that doesn't get enough."
12099920,12101360," That didn't get enough attention."
12101360,12105960," The one on the future of display technology that James wrote a while back."
12105960,12110000," The reason it's on my mind is because someone specifically flagged it for me saying, wow,"
12110000,12111000," this was like a really great video."
12111000,12114640," And I sent it to him because he was so discouraged that he spent a ton of time making it not"
12114640,12117560," just really informative but super engaging to watch."
12117560,12120640," And it really didn't perform very well on the channel."
12120640,12122960," So there, I'm going to go with that one."
12122960,12125160," Float plane."
12125160,12127040," Wow."
12127040,12130520," That one hits."
12130520,12136640," I'm just going to avoid that."
12136640,12137640," This one's from Will."
12137640,12139360," Longtime watcher, first time merch message."
12139360,12143080," I'm excited for the track suit desk pad at all."
12143080,12148080," So excited to see how ML/Chatbot assisted search is going to change how people operate"
12148080,12149200," on the internet."
12149200,12154200," What do you think is going to be the largest cultural change to come from it?"
12154200,12160880," Well, we're all going to interact with chats instead of, you know, with like SEO optimized"
12160880,12162440," Boolean, you know, whatever."
12162440,12167120," There's been this whole conversation about how we are all to a certain degree cyborgs"
12167120,12168440," due to our phones."
12168440,12170200," Have you heard this?"
12170200,12171200," Yep."
12171200,12176120," I think a really large extension of that has been search."
12176120,12183120," Search, I think in more ways than people like actively consciously realize, has shaped how"
12183120,12186760," people interact the modern world."
12186760,12192440," Even if your search is this thing, whatever, Reddit or this thing, whatever, TikTok because"
12192440,12197200," you don't trust Google to give you the right result anymore, which is like actually a problem."
12197200,12206160," But even with that, it shapes how people research or look into things, which is genuinely"
12206160,12211480," an extremely significant part of what people do to like grow in almost anyway."
12211480,12216360," And changing that is going to be wildly impactful."
12216360,12218160," I've got one for you, Dan."
12218160,12220480," Oh, you are going to make me talk about this, aren't you?"
12220480,12221480," I saw a comment."
12221480,12222480," I thought I would include it."
12222480,12224520," Highline is Luke and particularly Dan."
12224520,12228920," Why is there always such strong pushback anytime a Go XLR gets mentioned to try to fix the audio"
12228920,12231760," and sensor button issues?"
12231760,12232760," Control."
12232760,12233960," It's just control."
12233960,12235280," It's fine."
12235280,12238400," I will throw some pushback against this personally."
12238400,12239640," Fine."
12239640,12245600," My Go XLR bricked itself almost immediately upon getting to my house."
12245600,12248440," I contacted their support and they were like, \"Wow, I've never seen this before.\""
12248440,12250360," And they sent me a new one to be clear."
12250360,12252200," I don't know if they knew who I was or not."
12252200,12255960," I didn't reach out on official handles, but my name was there."
12255960,12260880," I don't know if they figured it out or not, but they immediately sent me a new one."
12260880,12267080," It then works, but if it loses power randomly, the profile is just gone."
12267080,12268080," That's true."
12268080,12269080," That is a flaw."
12269080,12270080," Why?"
12270080,12271080," I don't know."
12271080,12278640," If we lose power during the show and that I have my profiles backed up on my nails,"
12278640,12280440," maybe you should just get good."
12280440,12281440," I don't think it's crazy."
12281440,12283720," You shouldn't have to do that."
12283720,12284720," I blame Lucas."
12284720,12287560," I don't think that if it loses power."
12287560,12291840," It's like blaming Microsoft because you forgot to press control S."
12291840,12292840," That's also the wrong one."
12292840,12294640," You should be able to do that."
12294640,12297280," That's an auto save feature."
12297280,12300520," One thing that drives me crazy about it is that it's physical buttons are basically just"
12300520,12307080," for show because if it loses its memory, it's like, \"Hey, but all your stuff is where"
12307080,12308320," it was before.\""
12308320,12310520," We should be able to detect where it was."
12310520,12312760," It's not perfect."
12312760,12314600," It's not perfect."
12314600,12319880," One of the reasons that I like this step as well is I had to mute you guys."
12319880,12322720," What you guys could do for your mutes is pull all the faders down."
12322720,12327560," When you were unmuted, I got to bring them back up and they need to be at the same level."
12327560,12331480," It's all set and it's set it and forget it kind of thing."
12331480,12333320," I mean, it wasn't for a long time."
12333320,12334320," It wasn't for a long time."
12334320,12336440," Which is why I kept bringing it up."
12336440,12338440," Luke fixed that actually."
12338440,12343000," It's been pretty good the last two shows and the last two shows since he's had some incredibly"
12343000,12348000," complex audio routing going on behind the scenes to make sure that you can monitor what"
12348000,12349360," you need to monitor."
12349360,12351640," What goes out to stream is different."
12351640,12355200," If we have guests on, they can hear you, but you can't hear you even though it's in the"
12355200,12356400," same computer."
12356400,12361760," It's like I have five or six different mixes and sub mixes."
12361760,12366560," I also have a completely separate sub mix for me to be able to monitor what's going out"
12366560,12368320," to stream."
12368320,12371200," We don't have those echo issues anymore."
12371200,12377800," Unlike OBS, I can now actually monitor the audio that's going out to stream."
12377800,12380280," More control, more better, more simpler."
12380280,12382760," It has to get more complicated to get simpler."
12382760,12384520," Go out to the large is great."
12384520,12388120," The bleep button was incredibly irritating for a long time for me."
12388120,12390880," This new system is very robust."
12390880,12393680," What it also does is it mutes all the other microphones."
12393680,12400120," When Linus is swearing, you can't get the swear underneath the bleep from Luke or my"
12400120,12401120," microphone."
12401120,12402120," That sort of thing."
12402120,12404120," I don't know."
12404120,12405320," There's a little explanation."
12405320,12407320," I could probably talk about it for an hour."
12407320,12408880," Yeah, that won't be necessary."
12408880,12409880," At me."
12409880,12410880," Goodbye."
12410880,12415040," It just disappears in itself."
12415040,12416040," Beautiful."
12416040,12422120," TT Music Studio asks, \"Ever since your photo shoot, I've been looking for a good"
12422120,12423120," epilator."
12423120,12424680," Do you have any good tech suggestions for them?"
12424680,12426560," I trust your opinion more than Bing."
12426560,12429080," No, I don't have a suggestion for a good one."
12429080,12432000," I'm not that pleased with the one I have and I've only tried one.\""
12432000,12437400," So that's where we're at on that archived and finally, last two."
12437400,12441040," Kyle asks, \"Can we get an update on the gold paint fading issue on the water bottles?"
12441040,12445240," I'm hoping to pick up a new one soon, but the colors I want all use the gold paint."
12445240,12446240," They fade."
12446240,12448520," If you have acid hands, they will fade pretty quickly."
12448520,12453280," If you do not, then they actually last quite a long time, but it seems to be kind of luck"
12453280,12459600," of the draw and whether your particular composition of skin oils is going to wear it away."
12459600,12463640," We just basically have a disclaimer on the page that says, \"Hey, yeah, these inks just"
12463640,12468000," don't last as long, so there's that.\""
12468000,12473920," And finally, Daniel P. asks, \"As a fellow creator, I would like to know the rationale"
12473920,12477200," for why so is banned."
12477200,12480720," What other thing have you banned and what habits have been hard to change?\""
12480720,12482600," Is this not good?"
12482600,12486560," So is banned because it contributes absolutely nothing."
12486560,12487560," Try it."
12487560,12489600," Start a sentence with the word \"so.\""
12489600,12490600," Just try it."
12490600,12491600," Do it right now."
12491600,12492600," I'll wait."
12492600,12494320," So what do you think about airplane peanuts?"
12494320,12495320," Okay."
12495320,12498400," Now say that same sentence again without the word \"so.\""
12498400,12500560," What do you think about airplane peanuts?"
12500560,12503480," It contributed absolutely nothing."
12503480,12510680," So it's banned, which doesn't mean that we can never use it, obviously, in the middle"
12510680,12513640," of a sentence, so is fine."
12513640,12518320," And there are even situations where we will use it at the beginning of a sentence or beginning"
12518320,12527240," of a paragraph, but it has to be in the place of a word like \"therefore,\" not just as a"
12527240,12528240," filler."
12528240,12534640," A lot of times people will just put \"so\" at the beginning of every single paragraph."
12534640,12537840," It's like, well, that is definitely not necessary."
12537840,12543040," So I went to the store, so here's the thing."
12543040,12545720," So I just don't know."
12545720,12548240," It's not helpful."
12548240,12553120," And one of the big things that we try to do, especially in our writing here, not necessarily"
12553120,12554120," in our live--"
12554120,12555680," Guys, we don't script the wanch of it."
12555680,12557240," You can say so it's banned."
12557240,12558240," Yeah, yeah."
12558240,12562480," One of the things that we do in our writing is we try to make the videos as information"
12562480,12566040," dense as possible, so filler words, stuff and things."
12566040,12574960," So they all need to go, because we're trying to make the video as dense as possible."
12574960,12578120," And like is never going anywhere."
12578120,12581000," That's just part of my--"
12581000,12587680," A completely irrevocable part of my personality at this point."
12587680,12592280," And I think that's pretty much it for the show today."
12592280,12593720," We will see you again next week."
12593720,12596360," Same bad time, same bad channel."
12596360,12597360," Bye!"
12597360,12598360," [MUSIC PLAYING]"
12598360,12599360," That was a long show."
12599360,12600360," A little long."
12600360,12608520," A little on the long side."
12608520,12610880," I blame you."
12610880,12612720," Four hours and 19 minutes?"
12612720,12614800," Oh, we need to go for another 40 seconds."
12614800,12616720," Oh, that includes the pre-show."
12616720,12619640," Oh, for the flow plane thieves."
12619640,12622240," The show's brought to bed for the Ridge."
12622240,12623960," Square space."
12623960,12624960," Yeah."
12624960,12625960," OK."
12625960,12626960," [LAUGHTER]"
12626960,12628960," Let's have 30 seconds of silence."
12628960,12629960," So--"
12629960,12632600," Oh, it just sits there like that now?"
12632600,12633600," Oh."
12633600,12634600," OK."
12634600,12636240," Well, no, not really."
12636240,12638440," The animated line is fine."
12638440,12640280," Yeah, got that."
12640280,12645080," I love those shirts that the Pixel guys are wearing."
12645080,12645920," Those are classic."
12645920,12646920," What's that?"
12646920,12647920," A Team Liquid hoodie you're wearing?"
12647920,12648920," Yeah."
12648920,12652560," And that's the original LTT merch item we should reprint it"
12652560,12653560," someday."
