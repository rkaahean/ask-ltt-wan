0,3000," Welcome to the WAN show."
3000,5000," We have got a great show for you guys this week."
5000,6500," Breaking news."
6500,7500," Breaking news."
7500,8500," Like what is this?"
8500,9500," Like two hours ago?"
9500,11500," Three hours ago or something like that?"
11500,12500," Yeah."
12500,13500," Yeah."
13500,14500," S.V.B."

17500,18500," What?"
18500,19500," What bank?"
19500,22000," Just gone in Silicon Valley?"
22000,24000," This is wild."
24000,28000," Less wild is that YouTube has apparently relaxed."
28000,31500," There's stupid f*cking profanity policy."
31500,33000," I'm still bleeping it anyway."
33000,34000," A hundred percent."
34000,35000," Some people complained about that WAN show."
35000,37000," What else we got going on today?"
37000,43000," Ring gives police invasive user footage including sometimes of inside their house."
43000,44000," Cool!"
44000,45000," Even without a warrant."
45000,47000," Just if they feel like they want it."
47000,48000," Good job Ring."
48000,49000," Yeah."
49000,50000," What else?"
50000,53000," Really Luke?"
53000,57000," Just because I get to go first and pick all the best topics means that you sit here and have to take the good."
57000,59000," I don't see anything else I want to talk about."
59000,60000," Think about it for this."
60000,61000," Sounds good."
61000,63000," Trust me there will be stuff."
63000,64000," Seriously?"
64000,66000," What would you pick?"
66000,70000," There's something in here that was in here last week but we've also talked about it like three times so I don't know."
70000,72000," Alright intro!"
72000,92000," [Music]"
92000,94000," The show is brought to you by FreshBooks."
94000,96000," Goliath Technologies."
96000,98000," I heard they're online."
98000,101000," Square Space."
101000,102000," Really?"
102000,103000," Okay Tarkov."
103000,104000," Why not that for the fourth topic?"
104000,106000," Luke's got some Tarkov updates."
106000,107000," It's spicy."
107000,112000," First we need to get into the big news this week."
112000,113000," Sources for this."
113000,115000," I don't know everywhere."
115000,116000," CTV."
116000,117000," The BBC."
117000,118000," Blockworks."
118000,119000," Doesn't matter."
119000,126000," The point is earlier today the 16th largest bank in America which if you were a Canadian doesn't sound like that."
126000,128000," That would be not that big."
128000,132000," Big of a deal because here in Canada we only have like four banks."
132000,135000," We're also smaller than California in regards to population."
135000,138000," Yeah so it wouldn't be a huge deal here."
138000,141000," In America 16th largest bank."
141000,142000," What?"
142000,155000," Okay so they suffered a good old fashioned 1930s style bank run and the tense of its Wikipedia page went from is to was."
155000,161000," There was some indication earlier this week that the bank might not have sufficient liquid assets."
161000,164000," The stock price of its parent company dropped suddenly."
164000,174000," Venture capitalists advised their clients to withdraw funds and those clients rushed to get out what they could until regulators stepped in."
174000,179000," This is the largest American bank collapse since the 2008 financial crisis."
179000,182000," Now here's the thing."
182000,193000," Under normal circumstances we wouldn't really be reporting on a bank failure in the US because it's kind of a big deal but it's not really tech."
193000,199000," Except that SVB stands for Silicon Valley Bank."
199000,202000," So let's talk about that."
202000,210000," The liquidity issues that they suffered were heavily exacerbated by inflation, interest hikes and the overall weakness of here it comes."
210000,223000," The tech markets as SVB specialized in lending to tech startups and most depositors were tech workers and VC backed companies."
223000,229000," Much of the bank's deposits and this is wild were uninsured."
229000,239000," Now this is not in our notes so you guys will have to forgive me if I've got the exact details wrong but my understanding is that deposits were insured up to a maximum of $250,000."
239000,241000," I believe so."
241000,250000," Now this is something that is, you know, from a, I would say from an individual standpoint, very much a first world problem."
250000,262000," But most banks that I'm aware of do in fact have a limit to how much your balance can be before it just goes beyond what their insurance will cover."
262000,272000," And in the event of a bank run or insolvency or other kind of, hey, poof, the money's gone event, it is simply not covered."
272000,274000," It is irrecoverable."
274000,287000," So there's, so the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or FDIC.gov says that standard deposit insurance amount is $250,000 per depositor per insured bank for each account ownership category."
287000,290000," So $250,000 is insured by government."
290000,294000," So, but companies on company scale, 250k."
294000,296000," I was getting to that."
296000,300000," From an individual standpoint, right?"
300000,302000," Oh, I'm sorry."
302000,308000," Your $251,000 is not fully covered in your bank account."
308000,310000," Boo hoo hoo, cry me a river."
310000,313000," So 250k, you're a person, whatever, that's tons of money."
313000,315000," That's a lot of money to have in the bank."
315000,321000," But let me tell you something from a business standpoint, look around you, okay?"
321000,322000," Right?"
322000,323000," Do the math."
323000,324000," How many people work here?"
324000,326000," I think we're over a hundred now."
326000,327000," Close to it."
327000,330000," Does anyone know what like minimum wage is here?"
330000,333000," And we don't pay minimum wage."
333000,335000," I know, but like I'm doing like a..."
335000,336000," You see, I think it's like 14."
336000,337000," Let me look it up."
337000,338000," Okay."
338000,339000," Okay."
339000,340000," So we've got 100 people, okay?"
340000,341000," 1565 per hour."
341000,346000," So let's assume that we paid minimum wage, which we don't."
346000,347000," Okay."
347000,352000," So that would be $1,565 per hour."
352000,354000," What does that work out to in a work week?"
354000,356000," Let's say everyone was working 40 hours."
356000,358000," We have full time employees."
358000,360000," We're just doing this math live here."
360000,367000," That would be $62,600 per work week, which is only half of a pay period."
367000,368000," So times two."
368000,376000," Assuming, assuming that we paid minimum wage, which again, we do not."
376000,380000," That would be $125,000 per pay period."
380000,382000," Not including all other expenses."
382000,384000," Not including all other expenses."
384000,389000," Not including the fact that we know, in fact, do not pay anyone here minimum wage."
389000,397000," Not including the fact that you should have more than one freaking pay period in your bank account at a time."
397000,418000," So in the event that our company say we're to experience an event like this, where right now anyone with their deposits in SVB, if they didn't get them out already, and even if they did get them out, if they sent, if they withdrew money via a wire, like they sent out a wire, there is no guarantee."
418000,426000," Now that the bank has, my understanding is it's simply been seized by the federal government or something like that."
426000,427000," I don't know."
427000,433000," Yeah, so sorry for any little details here, but effectively its assets are under control by a third party now."
433000,439000," If that money simply does not come out, it's gone."
439000,445000," Now, there is some sort of stuff that were to happen here."
445000,449000," We would just be out, whatever was in that float account."
449000,453000," At least temporarily when you have bills to pay and salaries to fulfill."
453000,454000," Exactly."
454000,471000," Because if you factor in that this is a bank that specializes in startups, where they are theoretically putting their VC raised money that they are running off of, this is highly operational funds."
471000,477000," Yeah, this is wild. This could be, this could be even if, even a profitable company, okay?"
477000,479000," We are a profitable company."
479000,490000," But if you took our operating capital and just, even if you didn't eliminate it, if you froze it indefinitely, how do we run?"
490000,491000," Yeah."
491000,496000," How do I pay for whatever services you're logged in, float plane?"
496000,498000," How do I pay the bill?"
498000,499000," How do I pay you?"
499000,502000," How do I pay that guy?"
502000,507000," Right? Look how sad he would be if he didn't get any money."
507000,511000," This is wild."
511000,517000," And you know what? It's one of those things where it's something that Yvonne and I have actually talked about."
517000,522000," In Canada, the banking industry is fairly well regulated, pretty solid."
522000,526000," During 2008, we kind of survived stuff like that."
526000,542000," They were pretty steady up here. But I can tell you guys from my own research that the limit, so we used to bank with a credit union specifically because there was no government imposed limit on how much they could ensure."
542000,555000," That was the reason we did it. So we could have a million dollars or two million dollars or three million dollars sitting in the bank as our operating funds or to cover upcoming deposits or expenses for merch or whatever else it is."
555000,564000," We could have that sitting there knowing that in the event that something went catastrophically wrong, it would be covered by insurance and we would get it back."
564000,570000," But that actually changed. I think about a year ago. It was in the last year or two. I know that for sure."
570000,576000," And so I got to be honest with you, you."
576000,580000," We are pretty much in the same situation."
580000,585000," But not with if this happened to the bank that you're with."
585000,591000," And so reading about this as a business owner is petrifying."
591000,598000," I would basically roll into the office and just like, I just sit there."
598000,602000," What can I do? How do you run a business with no capital?"
602000,614000," And now it is possible that a sale of SVB and its assets and its liabilities, presumably, could be negotiated."
614000,625000," But I pretty much promise you that whatever cash it owes, if you get anything back from it, it's going to be less than 100%."
625000,629000," Like they're going to negotiate some reduced payout."
629000,635000," And you don't know which part of the queue you're going to be in in regards to people that get their money first."
635000,639000," So like, yeah, well, that was a whole thing that happened."
639000,655000," We saw with the NCI X bankruptcy where depending on where you were in the chain of creditors, even if they extracted any money from the shareholders who turned tail and ran away, it was never going to make it to you."
655000,659000," To you."
659000,664000," Yeah, they get paid no matter what, which is really interesting to me."
664000,669000," Yeah, so like, there's some funky stuff. It's going to be interesting."
669000,673000," Yeah, Top Gear 1224 says 100% honest."
673000,676000," This is why companies use stocks as bank accounts, not just stocks."
676000,680000," So I was recently made aware of something called a land bank."
680000,694000," Yeah, so here in Vancouver, where real estate generally does one thing, it goes like this, though not necessarily the case lately as some of the folks here who have been who have been on the market can attest to."
694000,699000," And also I can attest to as someone who bought at the peak, the lab."
699000,702000," I get reports from our commercial realtor every once in a while."
702000,704000," Prices are going down. It's exciting."
704000,705000," You're going."
705000,707000," Yeah, it doesn't help my mortgage, bro."
707000,711000," Anyway, right."
711000,722000," The concept of a land bank is that you just buy land because cash, like, okay."
722000,724000," This is something that Ivan and I were talking about recently."
724000,728000," The concept of like investments being risky, right?"
728000,730000," Investments carry an inherent risk."
730000,734000," So buying something like the lab, something that an investment that has gone down."
734000,737000," Right. An investment carries risk."
737000,739000," And it's like, yes, that's true."
739000,745000," But literally every asset class can be seen as an investment on some level."
745000,747000," Like here, here's something interesting."
747000,753000," Did you know that the Canadian dollar has lost five cents to the US dollar in the last three weeks?"
753000,755000," I know like this on your screen, but yeah."
755000,764000," Right. So the mere act of having cash in the bank not invested is an investment."
764000,765000," A good one."
765000,770000," Well, with inflation being what it is, I would say no, but it is certainly an investment."
770000,776000," So this is where the concept of a land bank was introduced to me where it was kind of like,"
776000,777000," well, here's the thing."
777000,779000," You actually can't trust cash."
779000,781000," Gold kind of sucks these days."
781000,782000," What? Crypto?"
782000,787000," I mean, sure, if you like riding the roller coaster, baby."
787000,798000," So that's why a lot of wealthy people just put their assets into land because, and this is the way the person explaining it to me explained it."
798000,801000," They were like, well, here's the thing about land."
801000,803000," They're not making more of it."
803000,808000," I mean, Dubai would have something to say about that, I suppose, but in general."
808000,809000," Most places are."
809000,812000," Yeah, in general, they're not making more of it, right?"
812000,822000," And so I, this, the coming back to sort of the reason for having this conversation, we're already looking around the lab going, holy crap, we're going to run a space in this place."
822000,833000," And I had wanted to explore the idea of, I don't know, renting the unit next door or in the long term, you know, because my understanding is there's a long term tenant there now."
833000,838000," So I'm kind of sitting here going, okay, maybe if we could scrape together a down payment between now and when that's going to be, you know, it's going to be a little bit more."
838000,850000," And I was informed that the owner is using it as a land bank and is therefore utterly uninterested in selling it because they aren't looking to profit."
850000,853000," They're looking for a safe haven for their money."
853000,854000," Yeah."
854000,858000," And based on this SVB news, that's not crazy."
858000,859000," Yeah."
859000,867000," That's just, that's just sound financial planning apparently when you just like have $10 million that you don't want to just disappear because they're looking for a safe haven for their money."
867000,872000," And I just disappeared because there was a bank run."
872000,877000," Anywho, sorry, I went off on a bit of a tangent there, but this is mind blowing."
877000,882000," This also is going to be quite the developing story over the last little while."
882000,889000," I just googled companies with cash stuck in SVB because we've had a bunch of people mention Roku, right?"
889000,896000," So we haven't said it on this part of the show yet, but Roku has 26% of its cash stuck in SVB, which as far as my understanding goes right now."
896000,899000," It's $487 million."
899000,901000," I don't know what's more surprising."
901000,908000," The fact that they have $487 million stuck in SVB or the fact that they have almost $2 billion in cash."
908000,910000," Yeah, crazy."
910000,911000," Go figure."
911000,912000," Roku be balling."
912000,913000," They're doing good apparently."
913000,914000," In cash."
914000,915000," Yeah."
915000,916000," Dang."
916000,917000," How many people does we even work at Roku?"
917000,919000," We'll see you moving forward."
919000,920000," Yeah."
920000,925000," I don't want to joke with that, but googling this."
925000,928000," The top stories thing on Google."
928000,930000," There's a post from two hours ago."
930000,932000," There's a post from one hour ago."
932000,934000," And there's a post from ten minutes ago."
934000,939000," This is very, very much a currently developing story."
939000,940000," There is some cool stuff."
940000,942000," There's some white nights already showing up."
942000,943000," Okay."
943000,948000," Even though it's been like literally hours, like Versell, linear, some other companies."
948000,952000," I know this because I'm just creeping F.O.T.3's Twitter."
952000,957000," But these companies are stepping up and saying like if you are a customer of ours and you're"
957000,960000," impacted by this, like reach out, we might be able to help you."
960000,963000," I don't know who you're calling."
963000,968400," There's even like some of them are talking about, okay, we can suspend, like, or delay"
968400,971000," payments while you figure out you're accounting."
971000,975000," Like some companies are being very cool about it."
975000,979000," But yeah, this is going to be quite yikes for a while."
979000,981000," I don't know what I want to get into."
981000,982000," Okay."
982000,985000," Your money is not an SVB, is it?"
985000,988000," Oh, I think I know who this is."
988000,996000," SVB, Silicon Valley Bank, it's Linus."
996000,999000," No, no, I just mean like you guys don't keep your money there, right?"
999000,1001000," Silicon Valley Bank?"
1001000,1002000," Okay."
1002000,1003000," Just checking."
1003000,1005000," Your chase."
1005000,1006000," Cool."
1006000,1008000," Oh yeah, SVB experienced a bank run."
1008000,1010000," They're like gone, essentially."
1010000,1013000," Yeah, I guess you haven't been on the internet in the last few hours."
1013000,1014000," Anyway, I'm live on Wancho."
1014000,1015000," I got to go."
1015000,1018000," All right, later."
1018000,1019000," Okay, bye."
1019000,1020000," Cool."
1020000,1022000," Is this that company you invested in?"
1022000,1029000," This is the NAS software company that I literally wrote a check to like a month ago."
1029000,1030000," What about framework?"
1030000,1031000," I don't know."
1031000,1033600," And if I did know, I wouldn't be able to say anything."
1033600,1039400," But this is the one that I was most worried about because these guys are very much in like"
1039400,1040400," stealth mode right now."
1040400,1041400," Yeah."
1041400,1043400," They have absolutely like framework has cash flow."
1043400,1044400," They're selling laptops."
1044400,1045400," That helps a lot."
1045400,1047400," You can refill the coffers."
1047400,1048400," That helps a lot."
1048400,1049400," See, okay."
1049400,1050800," Actually, you know what?"
1050800,1054960," It occurs to me that Linus Media Group would probably be okay because you could borrow from"
1054960,1059400," Creator Warehouse where we have consistent cash coming in."
1059400,1061840," Linus Media Group, I mean, think about it."
1061840,1064400," Many of our customers are probably impacted."
1064400,1065400," Yep."
1065400,1066400," So, oh crap."
1066400,1067400," Yeah, that's not good."
1067400,1069360," Oh, I got to talk to a customer."
1069360,1071360," I'm counting all balls."
1071360,1075360," Anyway, the point is Creator Warehouse."
1075360,1076360," Oh."
1076360,1077360," Shit."
1077360,1078360," Sorry."
1078360,1083360," That was quite the thing to witness."
1083360,1086240," Does any other company need a Wancho producer?"
1086240,1088360," I mean, producer."
1088360,1093360," Dan, how dare you apply for another job?"
1093360,1096360," Why on this show?"
1096360,1099160," He's not very professional."
1099160,1101160," I'm not giving him a good reference."
1101160,1106160," Yeah, just make sure you send me the link to your job postings and I can find out how"
1106160,1107160," to apply."
1107160,1108160," Holy shit."
1108160,1113160," That's a good reference, by the way."
1113160,1115160," Any who?"
1115160,1116160," Yeah."
1116160,1120160," We would be okay because we have money coming in regularly."
1120160,1127960," Yeah, not in large chunks from corporate partners."
1127960,1131360," But it piecemeal from individual customers."
1131360,1135640," That would mean that Creator Warehouse could lend us money to operate and we would probably"
1135640,1139000," stay, we'd probably be fine."
1139000,1144720," So that was my point was that if you have regular income, probably you can ride this"
1144720,1146480," out a lot more easily."
1146480,1152560," But if like this NAS software that we, I mean, I have no idea if I'm going to get anything"
1152560,1153560," back from this."
1153560,1155960," They're creating a product that I really want to exist."
1155960,1164160," Like a simpler user friendly and yet still powerful NAS solution for DIY and enthusiasts."
1164160,1169960," And they are completely in like noses pressed against the screens."
1169960,1170960," Or clearly."
1170960,1171960," Going mode."
1171960,1172960," Clearly."
1172960,1173960," Yeah."
1173960,1174960," Clearly."
1174960,1175960," Yeah."
1175960,1178960," Because it's like, I don't know, seven o'clock where he is right now."
1178960,1183400," And he hasn't received like the biggest tech news and startups in a long time."
1183400,1184400," Yeah."
1184400,1185400," Clearly focused."
1185400,1186400," That's good."
1186400,1187400," That's good."
1187400,1188400," Yeah."
1188400,1189400," Yeah."
1189400,1190400," Yeah."
1190400,1191400," I have a question for you."
1191400,1194080," Oh, I'm out of pain."
1194080,1198320," If you are, so you've invested in that company, you've invested in a framework, I wouldn't"
1198320,1202200," really call you an investor because you invest right now in things that you just like want"
1202200,1203200," to exist."
1203200,1205520," I would describe myself as like an activist investor."
1205520,1206520," Yeah."
1206520,1207520," Yeah."
1207520,1211320," I went in in both cases."
1211320,1214080," How do I say this without it coming across the wrong way?"
1214080,1216080," Without expecting a return."
1216080,1217080," Yeah."
1217080,1222920," I went in and book if if there's a return, I'm gonna be like, cool."
1222920,1228000," But like we talked about last week, the reality of it is if I really wanted more money, my"
1228000,1231120," biggest investment is Linus Media Group Inc."
1231120,1234120," Creator warehouse Inc. and float plane Inc."
1234120,1240240," If I wanted to have like truly you money, that would be the way to do it."
1240240,1241240," Yeah."
1241240,1245640," And I kind of danced around it last week, but it was a nine figure offer, okay, for the"
1245640,1246640," whole shebang."
1246640,1247640," I guess you technically."
1247640,1250160," Some people misunderstood, which is remarkable."
1250160,1251160," All right."
1251160,1253360," Anyway, the point is it was a nine figure offer."
1253360,1255600," If I wanted money, I could get money."
1255600,1260200," The reason, the biggest reason I didn't take the money is that at the end of the day, I"
1260200,1265680," don't have, I don't aspire to a yacht, a yacht lifestyle."
1265680,1267880," You'd be so bored."
1267880,1268880," Yeah."
1268880,1272400," You would actually hate that trip."
1272400,1279400," I think I guarantee I've received photos from him when he's on vacation, like standing on"
1279400,1282400," the beach with like the I am so bored here face."
1282400,1286880," He's not going to be entertained by a yacht."
1286880,1289000," I wouldn't even bother renting a yacht."
1289000,1290000," I don't even need to know."
1290000,1293040," Even if it was free, he'd probably be like, I'd rather not."
1293040,1295400," I already know I don't need it."
1295400,1296400," Yeah."
1296400,1301800," So anyway, the point is that a big part of the reason that I didn't take it is that my"
1301800,1309560," life would not be materially changed by having a giant dragon horde, which is obviously"
1309560,1311480," a super privileged position."
1311480,1316560," But it also means that I get to just do stuff like this."
1316560,1319800," So I get to just say, hey, that's something I really want to exist."
1319800,1321520," I know you guys are super cool."
1321520,1325400," And even if I never get anything out of it, this is great."
1325400,1332240," I will be the most hands off investor that you have ever had."
1332240,1336640," It's really funny because even internally, people will want to know what's going on with"
1336640,1340240," framework and stuff because it's interesting technology."
1340240,1343240," And I'm like, stuff."
1343240,1348080," I read about it in the technique, same as you."
1348080,1349080," Here's the actual question."
1349080,1350080," Yes."
1350080,1351960," That wasn't your method of investing."
1351960,1352960," Yeah."
1352960,1355880," If you were investing for profit, yeah."
1355880,1357600," I mean, I don't mind profit."
1357600,1358600," Yeah."
1358600,1362040," But if this was what you did, if you were a VC, I'm an investor."
1362040,1363040," Yes."
1363040,1364040," Like that's what I do."
1364040,1365040," Yeah, sure."
1365040,1366560," So I'm just I'm putting you in this position."
1366560,1373160," If this happened to one of the companies that you invested in and they're screwed, do"
1373160,1374160," you put in more?"
1374160,1375160," Yeah."
1375160,1376920," I mean, it depends if I even have it."
1376920,1377920," What if I bank it?"
1377920,1378920," Let's let's go."
1378920,1379920," Oh, sorry."
1379920,1380920," I missed the beat."
1380920,1382120," But what if I bank there?"
1382120,1384000," Let's assume in this situation that you have the cash."
1384000,1385000," Okay."
1385000,1387280," I bank at Bank of America."
1387280,1388760," That's the only bank in America."
1388760,1390240," Because I bank at HSB."
1390240,1391240," I don't know."
1391240,1392240," Sure."
1392240,1393240," Yeah."
1393240,1394240," Sure."
1394240,1395240," Whatever."
1395240,1396240," Because in this situation, you like reinvesting."
1396240,1397240," Sorry."
1397240,1398240," I'm a little more interested right now."
1398240,1399240," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
1399240,1400240," Reinvesting."
1400240,1401240," Let's say you reinvest the same amount."
1401240,1402880," Reinvesting means you just doubled the investment."
1402880,1403880," Yeah."
1403880,1405880," So you're not getting your return, right?"
1405880,1406880," Yeah, you haven't."
1406880,1414080," But I would imagine the paperwork of putting that investment into it means you've probably"
1414080,1416520," increased their valuation or whatever."
1416520,1419520," Like, I don't think you can just be say, oh, I won't."
1419520,1422520," I need to replace the money that disappeared."
1422520,1429720," Because you already have the shares that presumably you were issued based on that initial"
1429720,1430720," investment."
1430720,1436840," The fact that they like p*ted away in a bank or whether they p*ted away or lost."
1436840,1439360," Or lost it or whatever."
1439360,1445520," Like the vehicle by which they lost the money because they bought, I don't know, the 300"
1445520,1447040," Herman Miller chairs or whatever."
1447040,1449120," Like it doesn't matter how they lost it."
1449120,1450840," It's gone."
1450840,1452680," That doesn't mean you didn't get your shares."
1452680,1453680," You've got your shares."
1453680,1459760," So if you give them more money, well, I think they would have to dilute."
1459760,1461400," They would have to issue more shares."
1461400,1465720," Or you would have to find some justification for the valuation to be higher or something."
1465720,1467520," People are some combination of the two, right?"
1467520,1470680," Like you can't have something for nothing."
1470680,1474200," So it would be f*cked."
1474200,1475200," Yeah."
1475200,1480240," Because I'm wondering what's going to happen to certain companies right now."
1480240,1481240," Yeah."
1481240,1482240," Yeah."
1482240,1488080," And like, there's this brutal cycle that we just went through, right?"
1488080,1490000," And there's been a bunch of news articles about this."
1490000,1492760," Earlier this week, literally, I was reading one of them."
1492760,1498040," There's been this cycle that has happened where a bunch of very good tech employees were"
1498040,1499400," laid off recently, right?"
1499400,1500400," Yeah."
1500400,1509040," And a lot of these like hard hitter big time tech employees spun up startups in the last"
1509040,1513880," like month or two."
1513880,1518000," And a lot of these startups are like looking really good actually."
1518000,1521920," But if they're banking here, they might have just lost all of their VC money that they"
1521920,1523680," just raised like that."
1523680,1526720," So people are talking low interest loans is something you could do."
1526720,1533600," I can tell you from researching it, you can't just issue like a 1% interest loan, even"
1533600,1537920," if you're just super dupy, definitely best friends."
1537920,1540000," The government's going to be like, hold on a minute."
1540000,1541000," Yeah."
1541000,1542000," Yeah."
1542000,1543000," This looks like a gift."
1543000,1546680," Oh man, there's people on Reddit, apparently this is in floatplane chat."
1546680,1550040," People on Reddit posting about how their payroll companies went through SVB so they weren't"
1550040,1551040," getting paychecks."
1551040,1559960," Like the fact that this is the bank of the cradle of modern internet technology, it means"
1559960,1566960," that there's we can't even predict all the things that are going to go wrong because of"
1566960,1567960," this."
1567960,1571600," Because one of the weird things is like I said, I googled companies with cash stuck in SVB,"
1571600,1572600," right?"
1572600,1573760," And the main thing that shows up is Roku."
1573760,1581000," I suspect over the next few days, week, month, we're going to hear about a lot more companies."
1581000,1584880," That had their stuff stuck, right?"
1584880,1585880," Wow."
1585880,1586880," Okay."
1586880,1594120," It sounds like the assets of SVB were specifically seized by the FDIC, by the way."
1594120,1595120," Okay."
1595120,1596320," So government's got it."
1596320,1597320," Okay."
1597320,1601400," Well, good luck everybody."
1601400,1604000," Oh, do not like."
1604000,1605160," Really, really, really brutal."
1605160,1606160," Yeah."
1606160,1610440," The ramifications of this, not only is like the main news cycle going to take quite a"
1610440,1615320," while to actually pick up the impact of this, but the ramifications of this are going to"
1615320,1618560," go on for an extremely long time."
1618560,1622640," Silicon Valley Bank's been around for a while and they've been a big deal in startups for"
1622640,1623640," a while."
1623640,1627440," This is going to be a massive, massive change in how people do business because it's been"
1627440,1629440," like a default for a lot of people."
1629440,1630440," Yeah."
1630440,1633000," Oh, you got VC money, time to go to Silicon Valley Bank."
1633000,1634000," This is what you do."
1634000,1636040," People saying the government is the reason for this."
1636040,1639680," It is not that simple."
1639680,1645920," Like a bank run doesn't just happen because the government."
1645920,1646920," I don't know."
1646920,1648760," I don't know a lot of those types of stuff."
1648760,1649760," Yeah, there's a lot of stuff."
1649760,1652920," I don't know how much of this is true, but Flowplane chat is just exploding right now"
1652920,1659120," with apparently insiders at SVB selling shares in the weeks leading up to this."
1659120,1664760," I mean, obviously they wouldn't figure this out at the last second that they didn't have"
1664760,1666960," cash reserves to cover their withdrawals, right?"
1666960,1670120," So apparently Roblox has many SVB."
1670120,1671760," I don't even feel bad for them though."
1671760,1673560," They're rolling in it."
1673560,1674560," I'm sure they'll be fine."
1674560,1676360," Yeah, I think they'll figure it out."
1676360,1677360," Wow."
1677360,1678360," All right."
1678360,1679360," Okay."
1679360,1682600," Well, neat."
1682600,1684200," Good luck everybody."
1684200,1690200," What do you want to talk about next, Mr. Luke?"
1690200,1691560," Should we talk about that?"
1691560,1692840," I think that's funny."
1692840,1693840," The pouch."
1693840,1696400," Oh, sure."
1696400,1699280," Last week we announced this."
1699280,1707920," It's a pouch that holds technology, but we were informed that that name that we announced"
1707920,1710520," for it is in fact trademarked."
1710520,1717540," How anyone managed to trademark a descriptive name is baffling to me because when we went"
1717540,1725400," through the process of trademarking the name of our joystick covers, which we'll go on"
1725400,1729240," sale at some point, they're little silicone covers."
1729240,1731440," They go in your joysticks for travel."
1731440,1732880," Oh, were they?"
1732880,1733880," No, different one."
1733880,1734880," Okay."
1734880,1736600," No, they're not for a grip when you're gaming."
1736600,1737600," They're for travel."
1737600,1741160," Oh, so they're like protection so you don't get drift and stuff?"
1741160,1742160," We hope."
1742160,1743160," Yeah."
1743160,1744160," We don't guarantee anything."
1744160,1745160," No."
1745160,1750200," So we're not making any claims about anything, but they go over your joysticks and they lock"
1750200,1755520," them in place when it's sitting in a bag or in storage or..."
1755520,1756520," Tight end."
1756520,1757520," Oh, no."
1757520,1760760," When you're traveling or whatever else."
1760760,1764600," So anyway, when we were going through the trademark process for that, we wanted to call"
1764600,1767840," them stick locks and we wanted to trademark that."
1767840,1773560," And we were basically told, yeah, you can't really trademark a name that is simply descriptive"
1773560,1776120," of the function of the product."
1776120,1782240," So how anyone managed to trademark TechPouch is sort of baffling to me."
1782240,1787600," It's cool to me that the owner of the TechPouch trademark apparently considers us an important"
1787600,1791600," enough rival to bother, to send a cease and desist to."
1791600,1792600," But any who..."
1792600,1793600," We need a new name."
1793600,1795600," The point is we need a new name."
1795600,1797840," And we need a new name so that we can relaunch the page."
1797840,1798840," Yeah."
1798840,1800000," Because if you notice, it was taken off the site."
1800000,1801000," Yeah."
1801000,1802000," So it holds tech."
1802000,1803280," I mean, it can hold anything."
1803280,1804360," We have a couple of ideas."
1804360,1805360," Can I have sandwiches?"
1805360,1806360," Do you want to..."
1806360,1809160," I mean, I wouldn't recommend putting a sandwich in it."
1809160,1810160," It could though."
1810160,1811560," Yeah, but these are fabric materials."
1811560,1812560," They're fairly absorbent."
1812560,1815760," If your sandwich gets a little leaky, get like some mayo in there."
1815760,1816760," I don't know if it would be great."
1816760,1817760," That would be not great."
1817760,1820320," Yeah, you don't need like sandwich mayo in this thing."
1820320,1823600," Anyway, the point is that we've got a couple of names."
1823600,1824920," Yeah, do you want to create a poll?"
1824920,1825920," Yeah, yeah."
1825920,1827080," Idea number one."
1827080,1830360," Where does this go?"
1830360,1831360," Yes."
1831360,1832360," Idea number one."
1832360,1834080," Gamer pouch."
1834080,1838480," Once again, I think that would be pretty difficult to trademark."
1838480,1840480," So it shouldn't be an issue."
1840480,1846240," But my problem with that is it sounds an awful lot like..."
1846240,1847240," You know?"
1847240,1848240," Ah, yes."
1848240,1849240," Gamer pouch."
1849240,1850240," Okay."
1850240,1851240," Other idea."
1851240,1854560," Mini tech sack."
1854560,1860000," That has its own innuendo problems."
1860000,1862360," Tynan said tech bag of holding."
1862360,1867360," We also call the big area in the backpack."
1867360,1869640," Yeah, we call that like the compartment of holding."
1869640,1872720," So I don't know."
1872720,1873720," Bag of tech."
1873720,1875560," Yeah, that's pretty funny."
1875560,1877320," Linus's tech sack."
1877320,1881680," Okay, I appreciate the suggestions floatplane chat."
1881680,1886760," I don't know that we're going to go with any of those."
1886760,1891000," Jit bag, nerd bag, the pouch."
1891000,1892800," Tech tips pouch."
1892800,1894240," Yeah, you also don't..."
1894240,1896040," Yeah, like you could take the mini off."
1896040,1897040," It could just be tech sack."
1897040,1898280," Yeah, it could be tech sack."
1898280,1899880," You want to throw tech sack in there?"
1899880,1901120," I said tech sack in there."
1901120,1903360," How about tech tips pouch?"
1903360,1904360," Tech tips pouch."
1904360,1905360," Yeah."
1905360,1906360," It's not tech pouch."
1906360,1907360," Tech tips pouch."
1907360,1908360," Tech tips pouch."
1908360,1909360," All right."
1909360,1912880," L.O.M. says tech sack is fine."
1912880,1914200," I kind of like tech sack."
1914200,1915760," Yeah, tech sack's not bad."
1915760,1916600," Thanks, bro."
1916600,1918920," Yeah, yeah, it's pretty good."
1918920,1920280," We could call it LTT pouch."
1920280,1922120," Yeah, yeah, that's actually not bad."
1922120,1923880," Throw LTT pouch in there."
1923880,1924880," LTT pouch."
1924880,1925880," You should probably..."
1925880,1927920," I feel like we're going to have to do like a read..."
1927920,1931040," Like we pick the highest two and then re-vote."
1931040,1936840," You should throw pouchy McPouch face in there just to make sure that we've got the internet"
1936840,1937840," culture represented."
1937840,1940080," Would we actually launch that?"
1940080,1946280," I will commit to whatever the audience ultimately votes for."
1946280,1953400," I can actually feel Nick's cringe from here."
1953400,1954400," Yeah."
1954400,1955720," The energy is strong."
1955720,1957120," At least temporarily."
1957120,1958120," At least temporarily."
1958120,1959120," We will..."
1959120,1960120," James said NCX pouch."
1960120,1961120," I think we actually couldn't do that."
1961120,1962120," No, we couldn't do that."
1962120,1965080," That would definitely be an actual trademark issue."
1965080,1966080," Yeah."
1966080,1967080," Okay."
1967080,1970480," Yeah, let's go with what we've got."
1970480,1972760," All right, that is six options."
1972760,1973760," Okay."
1973760,1974760," Hit it."
1974760,1975760," All right."
1975760,1977760," Oh man, I need to see."
1977760,1979480," I just need to see this off."
1979480,1984760," Pouchy McPouch face with almost 100% of the vote."
1984760,1990520," Why do you agree to that?"
1990520,1993760," Okay, more serious votes are starting to come in."
1993760,1997400," Pouchy McPouch face held 90% for like 30 seconds."
1997400,1998400," Yeah."
1998400,1999400," And his now falling."
1999400,2001000," TechSack looks like it's going to come away with it."
2001000,2004520," We'll do a playoff between the top two and we'll see how..."
2004520,2005520," See how it comes out."
2005520,2007240," TechSack is cruising."
2007240,2010200," Yeah, TechSack is making up a lot of ground here."
2010200,2014360," Why don't we change gears a little bit here?"
2014360,2019280," And oh man, Luke, we've got so much stuff to talk about this week."
2019280,2020960," We've got a secret shopper update."
2020960,2021960," Del..."
2021960,2025160," Yeah, but we don't normally do our own stuff in the first four announcements."
2025160,2026640," No, this is Del."
2026640,2031520," Del reached out to me out of nowhere being like, \"Hey, we have no idea if you have a secret"
2031520,2034480," shopper planned or anything like that, but we're ready.\""
2034480,2036680," So, I figured we'd talk about that."
2036680,2039680," But first, why don't we do an update on the whole Tarkod situation?"
2039680,2040680," Okay, yeah."
2040680,2041920," Yeah, Chad's asking about like a parent..."
2041920,2043200," Sorry, what happened to Goat?"
2043200,2044720," Like, got root catered or something?"
2044720,2045720," What?"
2045720,2046720," Like his system's down?"
2046720,2047840," People have been arrested in China?"
2047840,2048840," Not..."
2048840,2049840," What is happening?"
2049840,2054880," Literally not one time that we've talked about Goat or his videos on Wancho."
2054880,2058600," Have I expected we were going to talk about Goat or his videos on Wancho?"
2058600,2063880," So, I am yet again apologizing to Goat because I wasn't prepared for this."
2063880,2067040," But he has released his third video on the topic now."
2067040,2071320," It started with the Wiggle that killed Tarkov, which is currently sitting at 2.2 million views."
2071320,2072320," Wow."
2072320,2078000," But his most recent video is, \"I was attacked,\" and he talks about some of what happened"
2078000,2079200," in the aftermath."
2079200,2084240," One of the things that he points out is that he was told by a number of people, including"
2084240,2091640," me, that he should have wiped his drive after all that happened, and he did not."
2091640,2092640," And one of the things that he tried to do..."
2092640,2093640," Why don't you explain why?"
2093640,2098240," Well, he installed their software on his local system."
2098240,2099240," Right?"
2099240,2100240," We got to get people up to speed."
2100240,2101240," Okay."
2101240,2102240," Okay."
2102240,2103240," Okay."
2103240,2107320," So, what happened was Goat or also known as Goat Moth, a creator in the Tarkov space,"
2107320,2112520," escape from Tarkov, a video game that I and a number of other people play."
2112520,2115760," Oh, are we good?"
2115760,2116760," Okay."
2116760,2120920," He made a video called the Wiggle that killed Tarkov, which was an investigative journalism"
2120920,2121920," piece on..."
2121920,2122920," Really good."
2122920,2123920," Fantastic."
2123920,2125720," On cheating in Tarkov and how..."
2125720,2126720," The pervasiveness."
2126720,2131040," And how much worse it is than most people realize because of the type of cheats that"
2131040,2132040," people use."
2132040,2134960," A lot of people, when they're thinking about cheating in first person shooter games, the"
2134960,2136800," main thing they think about is aim."
2136800,2137800," Yeah."
2137800,2138800," Yeah."
2138800,2139800," I think people think about it as wall hacks."
2139800,2140800," Stuff like that."
2140800,2143480," But usually you think about the obvious forms of cheating."
2143480,2144480," Yes."
2144480,2149840," And in Tarkov, it's not necessarily the obvious forms that are the most pervasive."
2149840,2153400," It's the things that aren't very obvious unless you are also cheating."
2153400,2158160," So he had to cheat in order to reveal this issue."
2158160,2162960," He then followed up talking about how his account that he cheated on did get banned,"
2162960,2164480," but he knew that was coming."
2164480,2168480," He didn't hide his raid IDs or anything, so it was very easy for them to detect."
2168480,2170520," And lots of things have happened in the aftermath."
2170520,2173080," We covered some of this, I believe, in last show."
2173080,2174080," Yeah."
2174080,2175080," But..."
2175080,2176080," But anyway, even more..."
2176080,2179360," After the video, you advised him to completely wipe his drive."
2179360,2180360," The question was, \"What's wrong with this?\""
2180360,2185640," And the reason for that was because in order to expose the cheaters, Go installed the same"
2185640,2193320," cheat software that they were using, which I mean, I don't want to generalize."
2193320,2198920," But if I was going to generalize, I would say that if you're a developer of cheating"
2198920,2206160," software for video games, you're probably not the most..."
2206160,2209040," It's very likely that you download cheats for a game."
2209040,2212800," That you're also downloading things that you probably don't want on your system."
2212800,2213800," Whether that is..."
2213800,2214800," And it's probably..."
2214800,2221240," Well, I'm saying if you develop cheats for games, you are probably selling software."
2221240,2222560," Your morals might be a little questionable."
2222560,2224800," That people shouldn't have on their system."
2224800,2225800," Yeah."
2225800,2233000," So it's quite common to have Bitcoin miners, or not necessarily Bitcoin, but coin miners"
2233000,2235480," installed on your system that are going to run in the background that you don't know"
2235480,2236480," about."
2236480,2237480," Stuff like that."
2237480,2241640," It's so very possible that in this particular situation, they install a rootkit on your"
2241640,2246080," system that they can do basically whatever they want with."
2246080,2251840," And he went to try to get some..."
2251840,2257160," In his original video, he talked about how he didn't want to interview the cheat developers."
2257160,2261640," For this video, he has interviews with some anti-cheat developers, and he wanted some"
2261640,2263600," voice clips from cheat developers."
2263600,2265000," And he thought, \"You should watch the video."
2265000,2267320," Don't get everything from the Wancho.\""
2267320,2268320," For real."
2268320,2269320," Yeah."
2269320,2270320," It's actually like, \"I'm not going to...\""
2270320,2271320," It's a 16-minute video."
2271320,2272320," No, I just mean in general."
2272320,2273320," Yeah."
2273320,2274320," Also that."
2274320,2281320," But he wanted a voice clip from the people that developed the cheat that he used in particular,"
2281320,2282320," because he brought up..."
2282320,2284760," It had gone undetected for three years."
2284760,2288120," So he wants to hear them being really cocky about it, basically."
2288120,2289120," Sure."
2289120,2290120," He reconnected to their Discord."
2290120,2295480," They now have some form of verification, and they figured out that it was a new user"
2295480,2297280," from the same..."
2297280,2300160," I don't remember all the details you should watch the video."
2300160,2302440," But they figured out that it was him, essentially."
2302440,2305000," And then just nuked his drives."
2305000,2306000," Wow."
2306000,2307000," Couldn't boot anymore."
2307000,2310680," Couldn't even find the drives when looking through BIOS or anything."
2310680,2313680," He thinks they killed the drivers on his NVMe drives."
2313680,2315160," It killed the drivers."
2315160,2316160," What's that even mean?"
2316160,2317160," I don't know necessarily."
2317160,2322640," I haven't looked into it enough."
2322640,2324680," There's a few ways that that could happen."
2324680,2325680," Sure."
2325680,2327480," Without having access to stuff, I have no idea."
2327480,2331320," I'm not good enough to make enough assumptions to know."
2331320,2332160," The controller..."
2332160,2332160," Yeah."
2332160,2339040," If their NVMe drives, they're like..."
2339040,2341080," It's not a hard drive."
2341080,2345280," So you can fry those in a variety of ways, to be honest."
2345280,2347160," In hard drives, there's other bad ways you can do it."
2347160,2352520," And I have since told them, like, yeah, it could also be in your BIOS at this point."
2352520,2353520," Yeah."
2353520,2356160," That's a whole thing that also came out this week, that there's..."
2356160,2359200," Oh crap, I forget the details."
2359200,2364520," But basically, there's the first instance of..."
2364520,2366720," It's been theorized for a while."
2366720,2375520," But there's the first instance of a firmware-based malware that can survive a complete system"
2375520,2382240," reformat because it can fool all the trusted..."
2382240,2383800," Oh man, yeah, secure boot."
2383800,2391640," It can fool secure boot and all the trust elements in that chain that protect the pre-operating"
2391640,2395200," system loading, actually even pre-UFI loading environments."
2395200,2398480," So that's a whole thing."
2398480,2404360," Man, seriously, malware that can survive a complete system format and then just go and"
2404360,2405360," reinstall itself?"
2405360,2409000," I mean, we've had stuff that can hide in BIOS for a while."
2409000,2411120," That thing that you're talking about is different."
2411120,2412520," This is pre-bios though."
2412520,2413520," Yeah."
2413520,2414520," Yeah, which is like bad."
2414520,2415520," Oh yeah, super bad."
2415520,2416520," That's even worse."
2416520,2417520," Yeah."
2417520,2422520," Anywho, in order to install something like that, they would need admin authorization on your"
2422520,2423520," computer."
2423520,2428200," But the thing is, when you run an executable, guess what that is?"
2428200,2429200," Yeah."
2429200,2431520," So that was kind of rough."
2431520,2433000," But I mean, goes to an OK."
2433000,2435200," You got a 2.2 million view video."
2435200,2436920," He's probably probably going to do it all right right now."
2436920,2437920," Yeah."
2437920,2439400," And he can probably replace some drives."
2439400,2440400," Yeah."
2440400,2441400," So he pitched those drives."
2441400,2444040," Hopefully that's the extent of what needs to happen there."
2444040,2447720," But there's also some other crazy news that happened that he reported on in that video."
2447720,2451760," And you should watch it because he has some interviews with the devs of a game that I"
2451760,2452760," don't remember off top of my head right now."
2452760,2453760," We don't have notes for this."
2453760,2455600," We're going to talk about it today."
2455600,2459400," And the interviews are very interesting and they talk about how they have totally..."
2459400,2463520," Their game was overrun with cheaters and they talked about what they did in order to"
2463520,2464520," fix it."
2464520,2470640," And now there's public community posts by users, players of the game talking about, \"Yeah,"
2470640,2471640," it's a completely different world."
2471640,2472640," I don't run into any anymore.\""
2472640,2473640," Wow."
2473640,2474640," That's cool."
2474640,2475640," And their whole approach makes a ton of sense."
2475640,2480480," And we've talked about it on Wancho, where they just have a bunch of systems in place."
2480480,2484760," And he talks about it, but they call it the Swiss cheese approach or something."
2484760,2486440," Because each system is going to have some holes."
2486440,2491360," But you just have enough of them that eventually you're not going to be able to make it all"
2491360,2492360," the way through."
2492360,2493360," Nothing can pass all the way through."
2493360,2494360," Yeah."
2494360,2496800," And maybe some can, but they've gotten it to a point where it's so low."
2496800,2503000," I mean, we've talked before about how there are cheats that are literally a robot arm playing"
2503000,2504880," the game that no Wancho can detect."
2504880,2505880," You're not going to fully stop it."
2505880,2506880," But that's not fun."
2506880,2507880," Yes."
2507880,2508880," Yeah."
2508880,2513840," Very few people are going to set up a 3D printer to move the mouse around for them to play"
2513840,2514840," the game."
2514840,2516760," And not, you just get too observed."
2516760,2521360," Maybe some RMTers will and stuff, but like you're really massively reducing the impact."
2521360,2522360," Yes."
2522360,2523360," But like, yeah."
2523360,2526160," So you should watch at those interviews."
2526160,2530800," Most cheaters want to press the button and feel like a Chad because they, you know, I'm"
2530800,2532840," sick of this game or whatever."
2532840,2533840," Right."
2533840,2538680," So I feel like for most cheaters, that's not going to be that appealing."
2538680,2539680," Yeah."
2539680,2540680," Yeah."
2540680,2541680," So, and that's all super interesting."
2541680,2544000," But one of the things that he talks about in the video, and again, I have notes."
2544000,2551200," So I'm hoping I'm going to remember this well, but that cheat that he used."
2551200,2552760," There's there's stuff on their discord."
2552760,2554520," I mean, I wish I could bring this up right now."
2554520,2558840," There's stuff on their discord talking about how the service is offline and no one can use"
2558840,2563040," it right now because it has to call to a service all the time and their servers are"
2563040,2564320," like gone."
2564320,2571080," And there's people reporting that we don't know who necessarily, but some amount of arrests"
2571080,2573920," were made arrests arrests."
2573920,2578360," Like people were put in jail and their servers were seized."
2578360,2580320," This is a cheat developer based in China."
2580320,2582960," We have no idea who did this."
2582960,2584280," We don't know if it was BSG."
2584280,2586720," We don't know if the investigation was already running from someone else."
2586720,2592280," I know that I know that developing game cheats is illegal and I think South Korea."
2592280,2595560," I think also using them is illegal in South Korea."
2595560,2599760," But I wasn't aware of any legislation like that in China."
2599760,2607880," Me neither. I do know that there is a culture of Chinese players cheating outside of China."
2607880,2614120," So I do wonder if maybe there is something and that's why they go to like North American"
2614120,2618200," or European servers is because they might get caught if they go on local servers."
2618200,2620400," I have no idea."
2620400,2621400," No clue."
2621400,2623320," Just a random theory."
2623320,2625440," Wow."
2625440,2627040," So very interesting."
2627040,2633120," Like the last story we were talking about, this is very much a developing story right"
2633120,2636120," now and I cannot believe."
2636120,2637880," I mean, the level of impact."
2637880,2642040," When we first talked about this, I went, wow, that's really cool."
2642040,2643840," F*** that game."
2643840,2644840," Right?"
2644840,2648240," Like I love this kind of expose investigative journalism."
2648240,2649840," Yeah, and he's done a great job."
2649840,2650840," Yeah."
2650840,2654680," Like, you know, good job, kudos and all of that, right?"
2654680,2659160," I didn't expect the explosion on their community last week."
2659160,2664400," I didn't expect that we're going to be looking at people getting literally arrested over"
2664400,2665400," the development of this."
2665400,2666400," Yeah."
2666400,2667400," I didn't see a software."
2667400,2670320," Dude, when I was like, oh, yeah, I'm going to like quit for a while because this situation"
2670320,2671320," is so bad."
2671320,2673400," I didn't expect things would happen."
2673400,2677040," I still haven't played yet, but like I didn't expect things would happen this fast that"
2677040,2682800," are like, oh, the like main sheet in the whole game just got deleted from the internet."
2682800,2684600," Like that's a pretty big deal."
2684600,2691960," So BBC.com, police bust world's biggest video game cheat operation."
2691960,2695040," Several luxury sports cars were among assets seized."
2695040,2696040," Oh, for crying out loud."
2696040,2697040," Okay, this is awesome."
2697040,2700080," We're among assets seized in the raid."
2700080,2702080," Nice cars."
2702080,2704960," Ah, Chinese police and gaming giant Tencent."
2704960,2708760," They probably go faster than like all the other cars on the track because they're like"
2708760,2709760," they like Jesus."
2709760,2710760," Sorry."
2710760,2711760," Because they what they cheated."
2711760,2714520," Oh my God."
2714520,2717000," They're like 76 million dollars in revenue."
2717000,2718920," They stole they seized assets."
2718920,2721280," So it was like a million in rev."
2721280,2730720," How many people are buying this stuff subscription prices for users began at about a $10 a day."
2730720,2733520," I don't know if I ever know if this is the same one."
2733520,2734520," When is this from?"
2734520,2735520," I don't know."
2735520,2738520," This is from March 30th of oh, oh, oh two years ago."
2738520,2739520," Never mind this old."
2739520,2740520," This is yeah."
2740520,2741520," Okay."
2741520,2743920," Yeah, because I think they posted this to show that yes."
2743920,2745800," It is very much a thing."
2745800,2746800," It is a thing."
2746800,2747800," Okay."
2747800,2748800," Yeah."
2748800,2749800," All right."
2749800,2750800," All right."
2750800,2751800," Well, thank you for that."
2751800,2752800," Wow."
2752800,2756800," There's a bunch of people posting in Flowplane chat."
2756800,2757800," Wanny pack."
2757800,2760200," Andrew Tate was running a cheating operation."
2760200,2762160," Got him."
2762160,2763480," It's not a Fanny pack though."
2763480,2765120," Yeah, it's not a Fanny pack."
2765120,2770480," If we were to ever do a Fanny pack, I give you my personal Linus Tech Tips guarantee."
2770480,2771760," We will call it the Wanny pack."
2771760,2773480," I promise."
2773480,2775360," As long as it has like a win, a win."
2775360,2776360," It would have to be a win."
2776360,2777360," Yeah, color scheme."
2777360,2779000," But yes, yes, yes, we will do it."
2779000,2780000," We'll do it."
2780000,2781000," Okay."
2781000,2782000," We should remake the poll."
2782000,2783880," It's tech sack versus pouchy McPouch face."
2783880,2784880," Okay."
2784880,2786480," Guys, come on."
2786480,2792520," Oh, actually Linus Tech Tote had a lot of people asking for it as well."
2792520,2796600," Should we just do another round and then do one more after?"
2796600,2798120," I think it's got to come down to two."
2798120,2800120," Yeah, we'll put these two more options in."
2800120,2802040," So let's put in the two new options."
2802040,2806040," So Linus Tech Tote and, oh no, that's the only one."
2806040,2809400," And then tech sack and pouchy McPouch face."
2809400,2810400," Okay."
2810400,2811400," Yeah."
2811400,2816240," Tote is just T-O-T-E, right?"
2816240,2817240," Yeah."
2817240,2820920," Oh man, oh, the L-T-T bag."
2820920,2823120," That's pretty funny actually."
2823120,2824400," Throw in the L-T-T bag."
2824400,2826520," So just L-T-T bag."
2826520,2831720," But it's funny if you say it out loud because testicles."
2831720,2835280," I didn't get it actually until you said it's funny if you say it out loud and then I got"
2835280,2836280," it."
2836280,2837280," I don't know why."
2837280,2840280," Because testicles."
2840280,2841280," No."
2841280,2842280," All right."
2842280,2853640," Why don't we change gears and, oh my, is there any good news this week?"
2853640,2857720," Ring is giving police invasive user footage."
2857720,2862880," I mean, we're not just talking like, you know, porch pirates need a reckoning and you got"
2862880,2864400," to like catch these guys."
2864400,2868600," We're talking last year."
2868600,2872720," Ring announced that at the end of this month, it will require new and existing users to"
2872720,2876200," buy a subscription for basic security features that used to be included with the purchase"
2876200,2882040," of the camera, including using the Ring app to arm and disarm security, receiving notifications"
2882040,2886400," when an alarm triggers or customizing the camera to record during an alarm."
2886400,2892160," It was allowing police access to users cameras without a warrant or the owner's consent because"
2892160,2894640," the police claimed it was an emergency."
2894640,2899160," Ring has also been repeatedly criticized for providing users footage to police even when"
2899160,2903720," it has no legal obligation to do so."
2903720,2908760," Ring claims that they carefully review all requests from law enforcement and ask for revising"
2908760,2912360," warrants when the demands are inappropriate or overly broad."
2912360,2917400," That last year, Michael Larkin, a Ring user in Ohio with 21 cameras around his home and"
2917400,2921960," business, was asked by police to provide footage from his outside-facing cameras to aid in"
2921960,2924840," an ongoing investigation into a neighbor."
2924840,2928840," He voluntarily gave them the footage from the time period they requested."
2928840,2933480," The police then asked for all the footage from the day in question, which he declined."
2933480,2936320," The camera's recording short bursts whenever there's movement and it would have taken"
2936320,2938760," a long time to download and send each file."
2938760,2943880," The police then sent a warrant to Ring requesting all of the footage from all of his cameras,"
2943880,2948560," which Ring gave them, including footage from the three cameras inside his house and the"
2948560,2953480," 13 cameras at his business, which is at a completely separate location."
2953480,2957640," One of the cameras inside the home is located in his bedroom."
2957640,2958640," Okay."
2958640,2961400," What the f***?"
2961400,2966880," Am I the crazy person here?"
2966880,2970480," There is a discussion question that should consumers ever trust a large company have access to"
2970480,2972160," their footage at this point."
2972160,2973640," No."
2973640,2974800," Close circuit, man."
2974800,2980200," Larkin only found out about this when Ring sent him a notification that police had been"
2980200,2981440," given his footage."
2981440,2987320," They didn't request or otherwise push back on the warrant or anything like that."
2987320,2989000," They're just like, \"Yep."
2989000,2991880," Here's footage from this guy's bedroom."
2991880,2994960," Hopefully you like watching videos of him banging.\""
2995960,2998960," Unbelievable, right?"
2998960,2999960," Yeah."
2999960,3000960," No, it absolutely is."
3000960,3001960," I don't know."
3001960,3004000," We've talked about this concept for a long time."
3004000,3009400," We've warned people about doorbell stuff, like Ring doorbells for a long time."
3009400,3010400," This is why."
3010400,3011400," Yeah."
3011400,3014080," We did a couple of sponsored spots with Ring way back in the day."
3014080,3018520," I think that was like pre-Amazon acquisition."
3018520,3023800," I forget when it happened, but there was a fairly early incident where they were just"
3023800,3027280," handing over footage and we basically said, \"Look, you guys need to change this policy"
3027280,3030040," or we're not going to work with you anymore.\""
3030040,3034800," Well, we don't work with Ring anymore."
3034800,3035800," Yeah."
3035800,3037760," There are solutions for this."
3037760,3042000," They're not quite as easy and they're not quite as cheap, but there are solutions for"
3042000,3044160," this for doing it yourself."
3044160,3050120," Unfortunately, that's the way it's got to be, in my opinion."
3050120,3052240," Especially if you have the cameras inside your house, man."
3052240,3054680," Like in the bedroom."
3054680,3055840," I do have to."
3055840,3056840," Okay."
3056840,3060320," I was about to be all judgey and say, \"Well, why would you have a camera in your bedroom"
3060320,3062600," in the first place that's stupid?\" or something like that."
3062600,3064160," But I mean, okay, I don't know."
3064160,3065600," Maybe they have pets."
3065600,3069480," And maybe their pets like to hang out in the bedroom and they like to keep an eye on them."
3069480,3073360," For whatever reason, they could have health problems or you don't know."
3073360,3075960," You never know what someone's situation is."
3075960,3083680," Maybe there's a very good reason that Conrad..."
3083680,3085360," What the heck, man?"
3085360,3088240," I personally use Yuffie cameras in my bathroom."
3088240,3089560," This is one of our developers."
3089560,3092080," Surely, you must know better."
3092080,3095680," I mean, he's a hundred percent kidding."
3095680,3096680," Yeah."
3096680,3097680," Okay."
3097680,3098680," Okay."
3098680,3103640," It's time for our last poll."
3103640,3104640," We do need this name."
3104640,3106880," We need to get this thing relaunched on the store."
3106880,3107880," The results..."
3107880,3108880," Okay."
3108880,3109880," Is it our last poll?"
3109880,3110880," So, is it our last one?"
3110880,3111880," This is our last one."
3111880,3112880," Because..."
3112880,3113880," Oh, what now?"
3113880,3119120," The tote at 16% of the vote could individually decide any of the three remaining."
3119120,3120880," So should we do one more with the three?"
3120880,3121880," No, just two."
3121880,3122880," We're going down to the top."
3122880,3123880," Oh, I see."
3123880,3129600," Yeah, because we've got one percent difference and 16% of the votes are on tote."
3129600,3132480," So it will like actually completely change which one ends up in the finals."
3132480,3135080," Okay, Linus Techtoat is out."
3135080,3143920," New poll, it's tech sack at 26% of the vote versus LTT bag at 24% versus Pouchy McPouchface"
3143920,3145560," at 35%."
3145560,3147280," Are we picking just the winner of that?"
3147280,3149240," Are we doing another final round?"
3149240,3150400," Because here's a question."
3150400,3151600," We could leave out..."
3151600,3154040," Pouch is clearly going to be in the final."
3154040,3157480," So we could do a poll just against tech sack and LTT bag."
3157480,3160800," No, no, let's leave Pouchy McPouchface in."
3160800,3161800," Okay."
3161800,3162800," I can just..."
3162800,3165120," Yeah, yeah, let's leave the three options."
3165120,3166120," We'll leave the three options in."
3166120,3167760," Is this the final poll?"
3167760,3169560," Let's make this the final countdown."
3169560,3170560," Okay."
3170560,3171560," Do-do-do-do-do."
3171560,3178560," So there's the concern here because the non pouches are split."
3178560,3179560," I see."
3179560,3180560," Okay."
3180560,3184800," I think if you end it with multiple non-pouches options, it guarantees a poach win."
3184800,3185800," Fine, Luke."
3185800,3189320," We will do the three-way vote and then we will do a two-way final."
3189320,3193040," It's going to last the whole show, which is really impressive because Wanshow is like"
3193040,3197520," four hours now."
3197520,3199600," It's ridiculous."
3199600,3201360," Why is Wanshow four hours?"
3201360,3202360," We've got to fix this."
3202360,3203360," Okay, that's it."
3203360,3204360," Wanshow is done."
3204360,3205360," Bye."
3205360,3206360," No, I'm kidding."
3206360,3207360," No, I'm kidding."
3207360,3208360," I'm not done."
3208360,3209360," There's so much more to talk about this week."
3209360,3211640," How were you not able to find topics to..."
3211640,3212640," Oh!"
3212640,3213640," Oh, this is great."
3213640,3214640," Okay."
3214640,3218080," I guess we're going to talk about more LTT store stuff because this is super exciting."
3218080,3219080," I didn't find topics."
3219080,3222280," Well, we've been talking about other than Ring, which I didn't want to talk about because"
3222280,3223280," I hate that."
3223280,3226680," I mean, it's fair to talk about it on the show, but I just..."
3226680,3230920," We've been saying for so many years not to do it because of this reason that just happened."
3230920,3231920," So it's just like..."
3231920,3234120," It's good to talk about it."
3234120,3235120," It's just frustrating."
3235120,3236360," Actually, you know what?"
3236360,3240440," Let's get the sponsors out of the way and then we will get to the next thing."
3240440,3241440," Oh, cool."
3241440,3242440," All right."
3242440,3243440," I'm actually very excited for the sponsors."
3243440,3244440," You're excited for the sponsors."
3244440,3245440," I am."
3245440,3246440," Since when are you excited for sponsors?"
3246440,3247440," There's a privateer."
3247440,3249080," Because there's a Dennis integration."
3249080,3250080," Oh, no."
3250080,3251080," Wait, what is this?"
3251080,3252960," It's all Dennis integrations?"
3252960,3253960," What is this, Dan?"
3253960,3254960," Let's go!"
3254960,3256320," Dan's got a whole bunch."
3256320,3258760," He's got paperwork over there."
3258760,3261640," So the thing that we're using for Wanchow now, the new software that we're using for"
3261640,3269720," Wanchow stores all of the sources in like VRAM."
3269720,3270720," I see."
3270720,3272440," So it's like really quick and stable and stuff."
3272440,3277680," I like filled the card with stuff that Dennis made for these ad spots."
3277680,3278680," The VRAM is like..."
3278680,3279680," It's like..."
3279680,3281520," Seven gigs of VRAM."
3281520,3284680," I have 78 sources."
3284680,3290160," Anyway, if you want to do your sponsor reads, I've been practicing all day."
3290160,3294360," There we were."
3294360,3296160," Okay."
3296160,3299440," Today's show is brought to you by FreshBooks."
3299440,3304240," If your math is as bad as mine, you will need FreshBooks."
3304240,3306480," Minus, I know you're not that good with math."
3306480,3307480," Thanks, Dennis."
3307480,3312600," FreshBooks is an easy to use accounting software that makes it simple to send invoices and"
3312600,3314160," collect your cash."
3314160,3318480," FreshBooks was created specifically for business owners and accounting professionals, so it"
3318480,3322200," hits that sweet spot between usable and useful."

3339480,3344560," Go to freshbooks.com/when to save 90% on your first four months."
3344560,3346880," Wow, that was very choreographed."
3346880,3347880," So sorry."
3347880,3354260," So you are over there like manually teeing up this camera and like all these different"
3354260,3355560," effects and stuff."
3355560,3356560," You got a whole script."
3356560,3358600," Okay, hold on a second."
3358600,3364040," How many hours today did we dedicate to these WAN shows Monster's Box?"
3364040,3365040," 30 minutes."
3365040,3366700," Oh, okay."
3366700,3368600," You said you spent all day practicing."
3368600,3369600," Yeah, yeah."
3369600,3371840," But it only took 30 minutes."
3371840,3373800," No, I'm hyperbole."
3373800,3374800," Okay."
3374800,3379080," The show is also brought to you by Goliath Technologies."
3379080,3384600," Goliath is a best-in-class end-user experience monitoring and troubleshooting software."
3384600,3388520," It allows you to find the root cause of any IT issue in three clicks or less."

3432960,3435960," All these like animations and stuff and everything."
3435960,3439960," Although that LTT logo, just like hanging out in the middle of the screen looks a little"
3439960,3441480," clunky."
3441480,3446280," And 20% off quote Linus Tech Tips to avail the discount."
3446280,3451120," Dennis must have wrote this."
3451120,3452120," Must have wrote."
3452120,3453120," Must have written."
3453120,3454120," Is that also off-centered?"
3454120,3455120," Can you bring that up again?"
3455120,3456120," Oh, yeah, sure."
3456120,3457120," Can he do that?"
3457120,3458720," Or is it like 16 different buttons?"
3458720,3461400," Honestly, I have 34 different buttons."
3461400,3462400," Oh, no, it's centered."
3462400,3463400," It's just my angle."
3463400,3466880," 20% off quote Linus Tech Tips to avail the discount."
3466880,3467880," He's trying."
3467880,3468880," He's doing a good job."
3468880,3469880," Good job, Dennis."
3469880,3471640," Maybe he needs a proofreader, though."
3471640,3475280," All right, finally, the show is brought to you by Squarespace."
3475280,3483360," Building your own website may seem..."
3483360,3484360," Thank you, Luke."
3484360,3485360," That's really helpful."
3485360,3489640," May seem daunting, but Squarespace is here to make it easier than figuring out how the"
3489640,3493000," self-serve line works at your local grocery store."
3493000,3496960," Squarespace is an easy to use platform to start building your online presence right"
3496960,3497960," away."
3497960,3503080," Offer customizable themes and templates for your online store, local business, portfolio,"
3503080,3504080," and more."
3504080,3506440," They even look great on mobile devices."
3506440,3511240," We use Squarespace for the Linus Media Group website and the LTX2023 website."
3511240,3516520," Okay, and if you already have a website, Squarespace makes it super simple to port your domain"

3527920,3530120," That's how you avail your discount."
3530120,3532840," Well, that's certainly eye-catching."
3532840,3538600," Thank you, Dennis, very much for the helpful additions to our otherwise bland and boring"
3538600,3540880," sponsor reads on the show."
3540880,3544040," We did have some frame rate issues."
3544040,3545600," Yes, I did notice that."
3545600,3551640," The next time that you trial stuff like that, you need to trial it while live encoding."
3551640,3552640," Yeah."
3552640,3555080," All right, we'll figure it out."
3555080,3557800," Holy crap, this is a close three-way race."
3557800,3561920," That's why I didn't want to include Pouchy, because I knew Pouchy was going to win this,"
3561920,3564280," but then the remaining two are so close."
3564280,3567720," TechSack at 33% of the vote."
3567720,3576360," LTT bag at 30% of the vote and Pouchy McPouchface at just 36% of the vote."
3576360,3580000," So it's TechSack versus Pouchy McPouchface."
3580000,3581600," Let's go."
3581600,3583080," Let's go."
3583080,3584080," Last poll."
3584080,3585080," Excuse me."
3585080,3586080," Last poll."
3586080,3589080," Hey, we should do a couple of merch messages."
3589080,3592560," For those of you who are new to the WAN Show, which seems to be a lot of you today, we've"
3592560,3596720," got 21,000 live viewers over on YouTube."
3596720,3599440," We've got Twitch is slow."
3599440,3600840," One moment, please."
3600840,3603160," My dashboard is loading."
3603160,3605160," Holy crap, this is really slow."
3605160,3607040," 5,600 over on Twitch."
3607040,3611280," And I have no idea how many are watching on floatplane because we still don't have a"
3611280,3614280," ****** dang view counter."
3614280,3615760," Get on."
3615760,3618720," You get owned yourself."
3618720,3622460," Anyway, so yeah, we've got a lot of new people watching."
3622460,3628680," The way to interact with the show is not through super chats."
3628680,3630880," I almost said merch messages."
3630880,3633200," Not through Twitter chats, not through Twitch bits."
3633200,3634480," It's merch messages."
3634480,3639800," And what makes them superior to super chats and Twitch bits is that while just like those"
3639800,3645520," methods, you can absolutely throw your money at the screen for no reason other than hoping"
3645520,3650920," for acknowledgement from people that you only know through a little screen in front of"
3650920,3652360," you."
3652360,3657080," Not only that, but in case we don't get to your message or just even if we do, instead"
3657080,3662920," of just like lining Google or Amazon's pockets, you will get merchandise in the mail, water"
3662920,3667560," bottles, desk pads, whatever we're going to call this thing that holds tech stuff and"
3667560,3669520," is a pouch."
3669520,3674840," Oh, oh man, we've got a new product to announce today that I'm so excited about."
3674840,3675840," We'll talk about that later."
3675840,3676840," We have multiple."
3676840,3678440," No, no, just one."
3678440,3683040," The point is that if you send a merch mess, just go to LTTstore.com and in the checkout,"
3683040,3684040," you can send a merch message."
3684040,3685800," It'll either pop up down there."
3685800,3686880," Dan might reply to you."
3686880,3690080," We might reply to your message live on the show."
3690080,3693320," And even if none of that happens, you will definitely still get your order in the mail"
3693320,3695480," and we make lots of really, really good stuff."
3695480,3696960," So head over to LTTstore.com."
3696960,3701200," All right, do you want to hit us with a couple of merch messages, Dan, before we move on?"
3701200,3704960," Or the first one I have here is from Michael speaking of building moats last week."
3704960,3705960," Yes."
3705960,3709640," Do you think that there's still space on tech YouTube for new channels to even come close"
3709640,3714280," as big as popular as you guys or others like MKBHD?"
3714280,3719120," I would have said no and then Mr. Who's the boss broke out big."
3719120,3723120," I was actually literally going to say yes, specifically because of him."
3723120,3724120," Yeah."
3724120,3726320," He proved it to me that it's possible."
3726320,3727320," It's hard."
3727320,3728320," It's not easy."
3728320,3729320," Yeah."
3729320,3730320," Yeah."
3730320,3736720," Like it's a funny thing because as the platform has matured and as the tools to create video"
3736720,3743120," have become more and more accessible, like, man, the production values you can get for"
3743120,3749200," a thousand dollars today are better than what you could do for probably 10,000 back when"
3749200,3750200," we started."
3750200,3757280," Like really, particularly in spaces like lighting, lighting has gotten cheap."
3757280,3762280," It's incredible what you can do with cheap lighting these days."
3762280,3765640," Like you can get high CRI bulbs at Home Depot now."
3765640,3771600," You know, that's the kind of thing that just didn't exist 10 years ago, right?"
3771600,3777440," And but what's funny is that as access to the tools and as the strength of the platform"
3777440,3783880," overall has gotten better, the competition has also gotten fiercer."
3783880,3790560," So I would say that today it is easier than ever to have a video blow up, like YouTube"
3790560,3794920," algorithmically so powerful."
3794920,3803840," But I would say that today it's as hard as ever to build momentum to build a large to"
3803840,3805880," build a large channel to build a team."
3805880,3806880," Yeah."
3806880,3814240," So it's, it's a, it's a tough because you might be able to hit like, if you have one concept"
3814240,3818800," that you've been sitting on for years and you make like one really sick video, you might"
3818800,3824120," be able to hit with one video, but, but continuing that, keeping the role of going, being able"
3824120,3828040," to release not only like one, two or three more, but being able to release one, two or"
3828040,3831640," three hundred more is really hard."
3831640,3834200," And you have to be there for the whole time."
3834200,3838840," By the way, the poll is really slowing down in terms of votes that are coming in."
3838840,3840800," We're only getting one or two trickling in at a time."
3840800,3843280," And I think, I think we have a winner."
3843280,3851800," It looks like it's going to be tech sack by four percent by four percent."
3851800,3854120," Wow."
3854120,3855360," That was very close."
3855360,3856360," Yeah."
3856360,3859560," Um, we can leave it running, but like I don't, yeah, we can let it run a little longer."
3859560,3860560," Yeah."
3860560,3862400," I don't think it's going to change much at this point."
3862400,3864880," What were you talking about again?"
3864880,3865880," Right."
3865880,3866880," Yeah."
3866880,3867880," Yeah."
3867880,3868880," Could you break out?"
3868880,3873360," So yeah, I, I would have said, I would have said no until, um, I think we have said no"
3873360,3874360," in the past."
3874360,3875360," Yeah."
3875360,3876360," Yeah."
3876360,3880280," I think, because I, I, and I will tell you that initially I thought the question was,"
3880280,3883760," can you still like, can you still break out in the tech space?"
3883760,3889000," And for that, the answer is absolutely yes, because I think the future of the platform"
3889000,3891880," is many niche channels."
3891880,3892880," Yeah."
3892880,3899680," More than these like, um, you know, like I, I see us kind of like a department store channel."
3899680,3904960," And I think that we've seen a shift culturally away from the one stop shop, away from the"
3904960,3908360," department store into the niche experts."
3908360,3911240," And that's a big part of the reason why we're growing our team."
3911240,3912720," That's why we're building the lab."
3912720,3917640," That's why we're hiring engineers and subject matter experts so that when it's time for"
3917640,3924120," us to really get laser focused on niches, whether they're a display or, uh, you know,"
3924120,3930760," CPU, GPU or cooling or whatever it is, we're properly equipped for it because I think that"
3930760,3938240," a niche that has a hundred thousand people that are super dialed into it is way, way"
3938240,3944680," easier to tackle these days than trying to, uh, then trying to make broadly appealing tech"
3944680,3949240," content to try to hit a million or two million or 10 million people."
3949240,3954800," Um, especially when there are so many channels that are doing that broad content so well,"
3954800,3956800," because it's not just us."
3956800,3959440," You have to, I mean, you already mentioned MKBHD, right?"
3959440,3960680," So you're going up against us."
3960680,3961920," You're going up against Marquez."
3961920,3963440," You're going up against Aaron."
3963440,3965320," You're going up against a J's two cents."
3965320,3970120," Austin, you're going up against all these folks, you just list names for like 20 minutes."
3970120,3971120," Yeah."
3971120,3976240," And then if you, if you went on for long enough, you might end up with the, uh, the creators"
3976240,3977240," were hoping to have it."
3977240,3978240," LTX."
3978240,3979240," Sorry."
3979240,3980680," Uh, we will confirm those eventually for you guys."
3980680,3984560," We just need approval from these folks to tell you who's going to be coming."
3984560,3988400," But if you, so if you asked me that, I'd say, you know, yeah, breaking out an niche,"
3988400,3991800," no problem, but building a mega channel."
3991800,3995320," And I'm not going to say that I didn't work hard."
3995320,3997920," I'm not going to say you didn't work hard."
3997920,4004280," But we would be just dishonest if we didn't acknowledge that there was a significant degree"
4004280,4006280," of right place, right time."
4006280,4007280," Yeah."
4007280,4008280," And you know what?"
4008280,4009280," It's always kind of funny to me."
4009280,4014960," Having access to NCX was such a huge, even back then, I thought the ship had sailed."
4014960,4018640," And it wasn't that, it wasn't that stupid of a thought, right?"
4018640,4021440," Like think back to when, when the channel started."
4021440,4023000," So what was, what was that?"
4023000,4027080," 2009, we uploaded the first NCX tech tips video."
4027080,4037960," So back then, I mean, how long did web startup, you know, social platforms exist for?"
4037960,4044160," Nothing had lasted as long as, what, 2009 to the 14 years, nothing, or so I think YouTube"
4044160,4046200," started in 2006, something like that."
4046200,4052320," So nothing, nothing lasted, you know, 17, 18 years."
4052320,4056960," So for me to look at it and go, yeah, I'm three years, I'm four years late to the"
4056960,4065680," party, you know, PC Whiz Kid and Chilla Frilla and Locker Nome, you know, these folks have"
4065680,4067320," all got it on lock, right?"
4067320,4071280," Like, how could I possibly hope to break into this space?"
4071280,4072280," Yeah."
4072280,4076560," It wasn't even that stupid a thing for me to think, especially with the importance of"
4076560,4080400," subscribers back in that time, right?"
4080400,4084520," Once you had that critical mass, well, how else could anyone possibly hope to get on"
4084520,4086960," the homepage?"
4086960,4092200," Yeah, you know, things that mattered back then."
4092200,4093760," But I ended up being wrong."
4093760,4095880," So I could be wrong again."
4095880,4101440," Maybe the next big all you can eat tech channel is brewing in the mind of someone who's watching"
4101440,4102960," the show right now."
4102960,4107240," There's also like, there's also other platforms."
4107240,4113240," I'm pretty sure they said specifically YouTube, but like, I think one of the reasons why"
4113240,4116440," we did get a start and why a lot of other creators around that time got a start is people"
4116440,4119400," were slowly shifting away from TV at the time."
4119400,4120400," Absolutely."
4120400,4121600," Something similar could happen to YouTube."
4121600,4125240," Maybe I don't necessarily, it doesn't really feel like it is TikTok, but maybe there's"
4125240,4126240," something that's around that."
4126240,4128680," No, especially not that North or that US ban goes through."
4128680,4129680," Yeah."
4129680,4131040," But like something, something might happen."
4131040,4132040," Who knows?"
4132040,4136120," Who knows what's going to happen in the world of apps or other potential websites?"
4136120,4144600," And then content types like the tech that we talk about, what is going to be out there"
4144600,4145600," eventually."
4145600,4147040," We're talking about AR stuff."
4147040,4149080," We're talking about these weird AI integrations."
4149080,4152240," We don't know the direction that either of those things are going to go."
4152240,4158440," And maybe you are a fantastic source for whatever that ends up being and that can be your niche."
4158440,4159680," Who knows?"
4159680,4160680," Yeah, 100%."
4160680,4167000," The flow plane chat is hilarious right now."
4167000,4168000," Absolutely right."
4168000,4169000," #NotMySack."
4169000,4171400," Stop the sack."
4171400,4172400," Recount."
4172400,4173400," Impouchment."
4173400,4177880," What are you guys florida?"
4177880,4181000," Okay, that's an old joke."
4181000,4187680," That's like going back to what's his nuts like gore, gore bush or whatever."
4187680,4191680," Me who?"
4191680,4192680," Oh no."
4192680,4193680," Okay, we're going back."
4193680,4197400," You should do, oh no, I don't think it would be worth the run, but you got to do a version"
4197400,4202400," that has like a smiley face on it and do like a limited run of poaching McPouch faces."
4202400,4203400," It's probably not worth it."
4203400,4209900," Speaking of run, Mr. Weige posted in float plane chat at Silicon Valley Bank north of"
4209900,4217160," 93% of the bank's 161 billion in deposits are apparently uninsured per a recent regulatory"
4217160,4218160," filing."
4218160,4221160," Whoa, anyway, sorry."
4221160,4225560," Wanna hit us with another merch message, Dan?"
4225560,4227560," Yeah, absolutely."
4227560,4230920," Oh, sorry, I'm going to say what you just said by me."
4230920,4231920," Say it through the mic."
4231920,4234960," The tech sack is apparently back up on the store under the name tech sack."
4234960,4235960," That was fast."
4235960,4236960," Oh, what?"
4236960,4237960," What's up?"
4237960,4239560," No one has informed me of that."
4239560,4240560," That doesn't seem right."
4240560,4241560," It is up though."
4241560,4244320," I'm looking at it right now."
4244320,4245320," Okay."
4245320,4254400," Okay, well, okay, Nick, it's tech sack if you're watching tech sack."
4254400,4255720," No, it's a tech sack."
4255720,4256720," Oh, it's tech sack."
4256720,4257720," Oh, so it's up."
4257720,4258720," Yeah."
4258720,4259720," Did I not?"
4259720,4261640," No, I think I might have misspoke."
4261640,4262640," I don't know."
4262640,4263640," No, yeah, you probably didn't."
4263640,4264640," Okay."
4264640,4265640," Yeah, all good."
4265640,4266640," All right."
4266640,4267640," It's officially tech sack now."
4267640,4270640," So if you want to get my sack in the mail, then you can order it."
4270640,4272640," Float plane is not happy."
4272640,4274760," Yeah, float plane is never happy."
4274760,4278640," It's funny because the more people love us, it seems like the more angry they get with"
4278640,4279640," us."
4279640,4280640," Yeah."
4280640,4281640," Yeah."
4281640,4284760," And like we love you back float plane and we're never angry with you."
4284760,4288680," Can I take a moment to just shout out a couple people?"
4288680,4295240," First of all, shout out the float plane peeps who happened to be 32,254 strong these days."
4295240,4299080," And then I'd also like to take a moment to shout out the social team because they have"
4299080,4306520," been absolutely annihilating their targets for float plane exclusive content these days."
4306520,4308680," Not in terms of like the volume."
4308680,4313520," They hit the volume targets, but they are crushing it in terms of the quality of the"
4313520,4316240," exclusives that we've been uploading."
4316240,4318040," This one was really good."
4318040,4325040," They were hanging out with the engineers over in creator warehouse, just a casual 99.5%"
4325040,4326800," like dislike ratio."
4326800,4330520," From this test run with our desktop injection moulder."
4330520,4335320," It's just really cool to see some of the stuff that goes on behind the scenes here that normally"
4335320,4339680," wouldn't get any exposure being appreciated."
4339680,4341120," There's a meet the team with a Vaughn, right?"
4341120,4345120," Yeah, that one actually went up on LMG clips as a promotion for float plane."
4345120,4346120," Oh, that makes sense."
4346120,4349880," And I think it's going to stay up for either hours or a day or two or something like that."
4349880,4354200," But float plane is full of meet the teams with like I think doesn't literally dozens of"
4354200,4356120," members of the team at this point."
4356120,4360160," Kyle's is a recent one that has been very, very popular."
4360160,4365560," This is a sidebar thing because it's not us, but garbage time also passed 3000 subscribers."
4365560,4366560," Sick!"
4366560,4367560," Let's go."
4367560,4368560," Let's go."
4368560,4371120," All right, Dan, hit me with another merch message."
4371120,4372880," Okay, I've got another one here."
4372880,4377440," Hey guys, since more OLED monitors are being made, is there really a point to getting one"
4377440,4383120," for somebody who plays mostly first person shooters and cranks the shadows up, thus negating"
4383120,4385120," one of the points of an OLED?"
4385120,4387040," Wait, how does that negate?"
4387040,4393040," So cranking the shadows up, I can see where you're coming from, right?"
4393040,4399840," Like if you lift up the dark parts of the image so that you can more easily identify"
4399840,4400840," opponents."
4400840,4401840," I misinterpreted this."
4401840,4404400," Yeah, I see where you're coming from."
4404400,4407680," If all you ever do is play FPS games."
4407680,4409680," Do you have CRT?"
4409680,4417080," Well, no, I would still go OLED because from a gaming perspective, the biggest benefit of"
4417080,4423240," OLED is not the contrast or the color accuracy, because like you said, for a competitive edge,"
4423240,4427560," many gamers will totally mess with their colors or their contrast or whatever else,"
4427560,4430160," again, occurs and all that."
4430160,4435840," But from a pixel persistent, like an image persistence standpoint, from a pixel response"
4435840,4439640," time standpoint, nothing else modern."
4439640,4442600," Like I'm not CRT is aside."
4442600,4447080," Nothing else modern even comes close to touching an OLED."
4447080,4452520," So the clarity of the image, particularly during fast movements, like if you are if"
4452520,4457840," you're whipping the mouse, is so much higher than an LCD that I would rather have a 240"
4457840,4460560," hertz OLED over a 500 hertz LCD."
4460560,4464680," I say that out of ignorance though, because we haven't yet been actually hands on with"
4464680,4465680," a 500 hertz LCD."
4465680,4468360," I think we're going to get to check it out soon."
4468360,4472880," But that's how I feel about it right now."
4472880,4475840," Really, really love OLED gaming."
4475840,4481440," And it's all about that lightning fast pixel response time and image clarity in motion."
4481440,4486440," Let me move one more and then we'll get to some more topics here."
4486440,4487440," The last one."
4487440,4488440," Right."
4488440,4491960," I'm about to deploy another Stratos FT server for work."
4491960,4493240," Are you basically run here?"
4493240,4495240," Because I don't know about that."
4495240,4497800," Oh, sorry, Luke."
4497800,4501720," Oh, gank, a merch message."
4501720,4503480," This is from anonymous."
4503480,4507320," Anyway, they basically run the CPUs and RAM in RAID 1."
4507320,4510840," What's your favorite fault tolerant high availability equipment?"
4510840,4514040," Oh, that's a difficult question."
4514040,4522040," Yeah, man, I got to say I was I was really blown away when I visited IBM and I got to"
4522040,4525840," get hands on with IBM Z."
4525840,4534040," Because on the one hand, I look at a product like IBM Z and I go, there's got to be a more"
4534040,4542720," economical open source, like way to do this with off the shelf, like super micro servers"
4542720,4544520," in running in a cluster or something."
4544520,4551040," You know, like the geek in me is sitting here going, this seems like yesterday's solution"
4551040,4552040," tomorrow."
4552040,4553200," You know what I mean?"
4553200,4561120," Are they really engineering an entire CPU for one system for like six customers?"
4561120,4563880," Like is this really the best way to do it?"
4563880,4566800," That's kind of my gut feeling."
4566800,4572000," But then you go and you look kind of like you're talking about, you look at the way that they"
4572000,4579720," build, you know, RAID 1 directly onto a memory subsystem."
4579720,4584880," Or you look at the way that you can literally just yank Maine's power out of this thing."
4584880,4587720," And it completely doesn't notice."
4587720,4590240," And it's it's pretty cool."
4590240,4596480," I would say that if you want to see me kind of geek out over over fault tolerance, that's"
4596480,4601560," the video to go watch because those things are, what is it, four nines they target something"
4601560,4602760," stupid like that."
4602760,4606800," I'll show it to my head, but I forget how many nines do you while I look it up, you want"
4606800,4609320," to explain the concept of nines?"
4609320,4615240," Oh, it's it's like basically when you're when you're looking at something like uptime, if"
4615240,4622240," you have 99.9%, well, if you look at an entire year, the point 1% that's remaining is actually"
4622240,4623840," a pretty significant amount of time."
4623840,4630680," So you want to increase your amount of nines because if you go from 99.9 to 99.99, that's"
4630680,4634080," actually a very significant reduction in downtime that you just had."
4634080,4638920," So increasing the if you say like four nines, that's the amount of nines past the decimal"
4638920,4641880," point that you have, having more nines is more better."
4641880,4649200," IBM Z reliability for Z 15s, their commitment is seven nines."
4649200,4653640," So on average, 3.2 seconds of downtime per year."
4653640,4657200," Yeah, see like that's sick."
4657200,4660280," That's actually kind of stupid."
4660280,4662320," Yeah, that's kind of amazing."
4662320,4667720," And so yeah, it was it was really cool, not just seeing the hardware and like pulling chords"
4667720,4672120," out of it or whatever, but some of what didn't make it into the video, unfortunately, just"
4672120,4677280," like talking to the people who work on and who design these systems was was very cool"
4677280,4681880," because it's a it's a completely different mindset."
4681880,4685280," Like you talk about running Ram in raid one, right?"
4685280,4691960," I think to the average gamer, if I said, Hey, you can experience three minutes less"
4691960,4700480," downtime per year and all it'll cost you is spending $600 instead of $300 on your memory."
4700480,4703440," They look at look at you like you're a idiot."
4703440,4705480," I'm really includes the first two nines."
4705480,4707120," Oh, okay."
4707120,4709200," I've been referring to that incorrectly for a hot minute."
4709200,4710760," All right, my bad."
4710760,4712360," At any rate, seven nine still wild."
4712360,4713920," Yeah, that's five pass."
4713920,4714920," Yeah."
4714920,4717720," Um, how do you include the first?"
4717720,4718720," Whatever."
4718720,4725800," Hold on a second, if it doesn't start with 99, you're having some problems."
4725800,4728700," Yeah, apparently it does include the first whatever's."
4728700,4730400," So that is five nines past the decimal."
4730400,4731400," That's still wild."
4731400,4734800," Anyway, the point is if you told the average gamer, Hey, you can spend twice as much on"
4734800,4738360," your memory and it'll save you three minutes of downtime a year."
4738360,4740440," Well, they they tell you you're an idiot."
4740440,4746280," Like no, I think I can handle what what is that two game crashes over a span of 365 days"
4746280,4749880," is probably okay and I'll save my few hundred dollars."
4749880,4757400," But when three minutes of downtime could back up all of your client systems or cause"
4757400,4760360," some kind of catastrophic system feel."
4760360,4761360," Okay."
4761360,4765640," Oh, perfect example of this when the Canadian debit infrastructure went down."
4765640,4766640," You remember that?"
4766640,4767640," Yeah."
4767640,4772240," Or when when our Rogers, uh, tell me man, I'm making Canada sound like some kind of back"
4772240,4773240," water."
4773240,4774440," It's just the things we're more aware of."
4774440,4775440," Yeah."
4775440,4780720," But when, uh, so Rogers communications had a down had downtime for like a day and my understanding"
4780720,4786040," is in the post morning to that it basically came down to like one system, you know, managed"
4786040,4790000," by one person like had something went wrong with it."
4790000,4793520," It's it's actually kind of amazing how patchwork our systems are."
4793520,4795760," I mean, okay, for an example, not in Canada."
4795760,4796760," Okay."
4796760,4802560," You get like one bank that disappears in the States and all of a sudden it's like, Oh,"
4802560,4803560," okay."
4803560,4805920," Well, the Silicon Valley startup scene has no money."
4805920,4807920," So that's cool."
4807920,4808920," Right?"
4808920,4817480," Like the way that the world is architected for very few points of failure that can take"
4817480,4818800," down the entire system."
4818800,4820880," I've said this many times and I don't know."
4820880,4826440," Maybe this is a dumb thing to talk about on a podcast, but like if a terrorist wanted"
4826440,4830440," to really harm the city of Vancouver, okay?"
4830440,4833520," Oh, all they got to do is take out."
4833520,4835960," Like two bridges."
4835960,4837120," We've had this conversation."
4837120,4841400," The entire region would grind to a halt."
4841400,4847040," I'm talking no commerce, no food, like nothing."
4847040,4849160," We have we have nothing."
4849160,4850640," There's one."
4850640,4851640," It's mind blowing."
4851640,4853160," There's that South Park joke."
4853160,4856680," I love doing people about this where they talk about the one road in Canada."
4856680,4858520," Follow the only road."
4858520,4859520," Yeah."
4859520,4864360," I realized that like at certain parts of the country, there is one road."
4864360,4868040," Highway one is actually a very big deal up here."
4868040,4869040," Yeah."
4869040,4872800," And when like a bridge goes down and it happens to be in that area where there is just one"
4872800,4875640," road, like Canada is split in half temporarily."
4875640,4881040," Yeah, an interprovincial shipping is actually done."
4881040,4882600," It's it's out."
4882600,4883600," It's out."
4883600,4884600," Yeah."
4884600,4887080," Pontoon bridges for the winds say people."
4887080,4890760," There are places where I don't think it would be feasible."
4890760,4893960," How would you put in a pontoon bridge to replace the port man?"
4893960,4895320," I don't think so."
4895320,4896320," Okay."
4896320,4897320," Okay."
4897320,4898400," Let's talk about something good about Canada."
4898400,4904200," I think the port man is the longest like suspension bridge."
4904200,4908400," It's like the longest freestanding suspension bridge or something like that in something."
4908400,4914040," I don't know if it's like in North, maybe it's only in Canada."
4914040,4916800," Longest suspension."
4916800,4919120," Yeah, I'm pretty sure this is a thing."
4919120,4923640," The port man bridge, the one of the longest in the world was constructed using the balanced"
4923640,4924800," cantilever method."
4924800,4925800," Okay."
4925800,4926800," One of the longest in the world."
4926800,4927800," Well, all right."
4927800,4929160," Never mind."
4929160,4934800," But it's two kilometers long, which in real units that anyone cares about is 1.26."
4934800,4935800," Okay."
4935800,4941040," What are we talking about?"
4941040,4945040," Canada is just a road in handful of bridges in a trench coat."
4945040,4947040," It kind of, yeah."
4947040,4949600," No, no, we're real."
4949600,4950680," I always swear."
4950680,4953120," I was always confused by the South Park joke."
4953120,4954560," And then I was reading the news."
4954560,4958520," However, many years ago, when one of those bridges did go down and they were talking"
4958520,4960400," about how Canada was temporary split in half."
4960400,4961600," And I was like, wait."
4961600,4964160," And I looked on a map and I was like, whoa."
4964160,4965160," Okay."
4965160,4967160," It literally comes down to one road."
4967160,4971880," In my preteens leading up to, you know, thinking about that I would become a driver"
4971880,4975000," at some point, I asked my mom."
4975000,4978440," To explain to me because I hear the terms thrown around a lot."
4978440,4982680," To explain to me the difference between a highway and another road."
4982680,4993000," And the reason for that is that one of the major arteries that we would travel on regularly,"
4993000,4999640," one low-heat highway at the part of low-heat highway where we would turn off into like"
4999640,5004760," our neighborhood, like our residential region."
5004760,5008520," At that part, it had traffic lights."
5008520,5011880," It was only two lanes, not not two and two."
5011880,5016200," Like two lanes, one each way with not even a shoulder."
5016200,5024760," Like I don't mean, you know, no fancy, fancy paved shoulder, no, you know, sidewalk."
5024760,5028920," I mean, it actually didn't have a shoulder."
5028920,5033800," Not only that, but the left turn that we had to make into our neighborhood wasn't even"
5033800,5035640," traffic light controlled."
5035640,5037360," And there wasn't a left turning lane."
5037360,5043280," Like you would just stop in the middle of this supposed highway to perform a left turn."
5043280,5047520," And the worst part is that that was very rarely a problem."
5047520,5053000," I grew up in Ruskin, okay?"
5053000,5054480," Cool."
5054480,5059720," What are we talking about?"
5059720,5060880," YouTube."
5060880,5066160," Nobody relaxes their overly restrictive profanity policy."
5066160,5067160," Sort of."
5067160,5069960," So does that mean I can say words like \"f***\" and \"f***\"."
5069960,5072440," Yeah, so I think so."
5072440,5074280," The sort of is that it's relaxed."
5074280,5075280," It's not gone."
5075280,5078680," I think some people interpreted this as like, \"Oh, we're going to do whatever we want now.\""
5078680,5080800," It's like, no, it's not gone."
5080800,5081800," Do go on."
5081800,5083280," We're just chilling out a little bit."
5083280,5087680," James has a note here that on Thursday, we had a short circuit video receive limited"
5087680,5093200," monetization because the host said \"penis lamp\" at the 23 second mark."
5093200,5094200," What?"
5094200,5095200," Penis lamp."
5095200,5096200," Really?"
5096200,5097200," Yep."
5097200,5098200," Okay."
5098200,5099200," Yep."
5099200,5101600," Are you going to elaborate on this?"
5101600,5103640," Nope, no one gets any topic information at all."
5103640,5104640," Never mind."
5104640,5105640," Recap."
5105640,5109280," In November, YouTube changed its advertiser friendly guidelines to be far harsher to have"
5109280,5112880," seen language we talked about on the Wancho, among other things."
5112880,5116160," Communication was poor and the language of the new guidelines was vague."
5116160,5120800," The changes applied retroactively, which is the most brutal part."
5120800,5121800," Super cool."
5121800,5125800," Resulting in previously acceptable content being demonetized without creators knowing"
5125800,5126800," why."
5126800,5133080," Now, after a few months of soul searching, YouTube has announced a new set of software"
5133080,5134080," play guidelines."
5134080,5135080," Does Google have a soul?"
5135080,5136080," Okay."
5136080,5137080," Sorry."
5137080,5138080," I don't know about that."
5138080,5142160," Their language is still somewhat vague and it does not address all creator complaints, but"
5142160,5146720," there are now clearer examples of what is and isn't acceptable."
5146720,5148680," Examples are always great in these situations."
5148680,5154520," Videos containing moderate profanity, like asshole or douchebag or occasional strong"
5154520,5161760," profanity, like outside the first seven seconds of a video are eligible for full monetization."
5161760,5165080," Oh, so I didn't even have to believe that, but I felt like it anyways."
5165080,5169400," Videos containing strong profanity in the first seven seconds or throughout the majority"
5169400,5176440," of the video, like are eligible for limited monetization rather than no monetization."
5176440,5178960," I'm not holding it works, Luke, but okay."
5178960,5179960," Does it not?"
5179960,5180960," I'm not sure."
5180960,5181960," It should."
5181960,5182960," It's just a tone, right?"
5182960,5183960," Dan?"
5183960,5184960," Yes, it works."
5184960,5186920," Hey, you hold it for as long as you want."
5186920,5187920," Okay."
5187920,5188920," Yeah."
5188920,5189920," Thought so."
5189920,5190920," So is a tone."
5190920,5195760," Videos demonetized after November's changes will apparently be re-reviewed in the coming"
5195760,5196760," weeks."
5196760,5197760," Interesting."
5197760,5201280," Stay tuned and maybe your livelihood."
5201280,5202280," Something."
5202280,5203280," Yeah, maybe."
5203280,5207640," According to YouTube, November's changes wound up being far harsher than they had actually"
5207640,5208640," intended."
5208640,5210120," That's a discussion question."
5210120,5214200," YouTube has to balance its relationship with advertisers and its relationship with creators."
5214200,5215960," Is it striking the right balance?"
5215960,5219320," Is it enough to fix these oversteps after the fact?"
5219320,5223640," I think the biggest problem is that it was retroactive and it didn't have, it wasn't clear"
5223640,5224640," enough."
5224640,5225640," Yeah."
5225640,5228240," And it was fairly, and they're not going back through your catalog."
5228240,5234440," I think that the longer YouTube exists, the more they're going to have to reckon with"
5234440,5238840," the fact that some of the content on their platform was-"
5238840,5239840," Man, true ed."
5239840,5240840," And this isn't an excuse."
5240840,5242400," There was an edgelord era on YouTube."
5242400,5244120," But it was from a different time."
5244120,5245120," Yeah."
5245120,5251720," And so whether that's, whether that means that, oh yeah, I don't know how to, I don't"
5251720,5257640," know the, I don't know the best way to deal with that, because I can see how an advertiser"
5257640,5263960," with modern sensibilities might look at that old content that some people are still totally"
5263960,5268480," watching and go, actually, no, that's not really what I signed up for."
5268480,5272800," I mean, it's been, it's been kind of eye opening."
5272800,5281440," I've just sort of randomly here and there picked up episodes of old shows that I hadn't"
5281440,5288440," watched in a long time from like the early 2000s and just the casual, the casual sort"
5288440,5291840," of gay humor, casual use of the hard R."
5291840,5293360," Oh, really?"
5293360,5294360," It's jarring."
5294360,5296360," Yeah, it's jarring now."
5296360,5297360," And for-"
5297360,5298360," Casual use of hard R."
5298360,5299360," Yeah."
5299360,5300360," Yeah, absolutely."
5300360,5303320," Like, okay, it was an episode of American Dad."
5303320,5305280," And it was just like, yeah, it wasn't for shock value."
5305280,5307560," It was just just like used."
5307560,5308560," Whoa."
5308560,5309560," Right."
5309560,5311080," Well, I mean, here's the thing, right?"
5311080,5314400," I was in 2003 or something, like 2002."
5314400,5315400," Yeah."
5315400,5320160," Like, I'm not gonna deny that I dropped my fair share of hard R's back then because"
5320160,5324080," we didn't even- the term hard R didn't even exist."
5324080,5326480," We didn't think about it, right?"
5326480,5333600," And it's funny because to me, that doesn't feel like that long ago, but to my kids."
5333600,5336000," Like talking like N word hard R?"
5336000,5337000," What?"
5337000,5338000," No."
5338000,5339000," Okay."
5339000,5340000," I'm pretty sure that's how people use that term."
5340000,5341000," No."
5341000,5342000," I'm worried."
5342000,5346400," What are you guys talking about?"
5346400,5347400," Am I mistaken?"
5347400,5349040," I think so."
5349040,5355240," No, the one with the, like for like mental disability."
5355240,5360440," I'm pretty sure people use hard R in a very different way than you just used it."
5360440,5361440," Oh."
5361440,5362440," Okay."
5362440,5363440," I do."
5363440,5364440," Hard R means ending the end."
5364440,5365440," I understand."
5365440,5367000," I understand what you mean."
5367000,5368600," No, I'm not talking about that."
5368600,5369600," Okay."
5369600,5370600," Cool."
5370600,5372680," I'm freaking that out over here, dude."
5372680,5373680," We're dodging bullets."
5373680,5374680," That's bad."
5374680,5375680," Okay."
5375680,5376680," Yes."
5376680,5377680," All right."
5377680,5380680," Thank you for that."
5380680,5381680," Right."
5381680,5387520," I forgot about the part where I said, yeah, I just like used it."
5387520,5388520," Yeah."
5388520,5389520," No, actually."
5389520,5391080," That's how I was."
5391080,5394480," I was pretty surprised with American dad and then you were like, yeah, me too."
5394480,5395480," I was like, whoa."
5395480,5396480," Yeah."
5396480,5398280," You've done me a long time."
5398280,5399280," Yeah."
5399280,5400280," That's what."
5400280,5401280," Yeah."
5401280,5402280," Never been a problem."
5402280,5403280," No."
5403280,5404280," Anywho."
5404280,5406280," We can breathe."
5406280,5407920," Everything's okay."
5407920,5408920," Cool."
5408920,5413960," So I hope everyone likes not having a job anymore on Monday because apparently I'm a"
5413960,5414960," giant racist."
5414960,5417840," We didn't lose our money in the in the bank crash."
5417840,5418840," Yeah, no."
5418840,5422440," But in the audience run."
5422440,5424520," All right."
5424520,5425520," We're good."
5425520,5426520," Okay."
5426520,5427520," We're good."
5427520,5428520," Cool."
5428520,5437520," Anywho, the point is that to like to my kids, 2002, 2003 is a long time ago."
5437520,5440960," It's kind of like, you know, 10 years before I was born."
5440960,5444760," 1976 is a long time ago to me."
5444760,5446160," It's all it's all relative."
5446160,5449320," I think it's like, yeah, piece of the piece."
5449320,5452800," Like that's a world that never coexist."
5452800,5455120," I never coexisted with, right?"
5455120,5461520," And so it was just it was interesting to me how jarring it was, even though, like I said,"
5461520,5465720," to me, people casually using the R word then."
5465720,5466720," Is that better?"
5466720,5467720," I think so."
5467720,5468720," Okay."
5468720,5471000," Casual using the R word was what it was."
5471000,5473320," Yeah, it was it was surprising."
5473320,5477320," All right."
5477320,5482800," So why don't we do a couple of merge."
5482800,5485800," Okay."
5485800,5490160," That sounds like a good idea to me."
5490160,5491160," Okay."
5491160,5493720," This is from Romeo."
5493720,5497120," Would you guys consider a hot dog or a burger a form of sandwich?"
5497120,5499080," Would they be their own food category?"
5499080,5504720," No, I hate it when I hate it when McDonald's calls their burger sandwiches a because they're"
5504720,5512120," burgers and b because I think that sandwich has a connotation associated with it that whatever"
5512120,5515640," the thing is is actual food."
5515640,5519720," And I strongly disagree that anything McDonald's sells is food."
5519720,5520720," Heck yeah."
5520720,5521720," Okay."
5521720,5522800," You want another one?"
5522800,5524480," These conversations make me uncomfortable."
5524480,5528720," It's like when people ask if cereal soup, like I don't I don't even I don't know."
5528720,5531320," No, I don't want cereal is cereal."
5531320,5534160," You would never eat soup dry, but you can eat cereal dry."
5534160,5535160," That's the distinction."
5535160,5538240," Never had like a packet of ramen without cooking it."
5538240,5539240," Oh crap."
5539240,5542080," See, this is why I just thought I don't even want to have the conversation."
5542080,5545160," I don't want to know."
5545160,5549000," I want to live in ignorance."
5549000,5550000," It's just food categories."
5550000,5551320," It's not going to affect my life."
5551320,5556600," I don't like you can't improve my life by convincing me that that cereal is soup."
5556600,5559320," I'm just I'm just better off where I am."
5559320,5560320," Sorry."
5560320,5561320," Do it."
5561320,5565760," Yeah, this is awful because yeah, you're like a little base, but so is a cream of broccoli"
5565760,5568880," soup granola bar granola bar."
5568880,5575080," If you were to take cream of broccoli soup and like freeze dry it into a bar."
5575080,5577280," What if you freeze it into a popsicle type?"
5577280,5578280," Yeah, exactly."
5578280,5580000," Okay, this is making me uncomfortable."
5580000,5581000," Let's move on."
5581000,5583200," See, yeah, I don't like it."
5583200,5584960," Next one's up from Jacob."
5584960,5585960," Happy Friday guys."
5585960,5590680," I'm an IT engineer that is often disappointed by mature technologies or protocols."
5590680,5593880," What consumer or enterprise tech disappoints you most?"
5593880,5597600," Example, Bluetooth, printers, AV, SMB, etc."
5597600,5599520," Oh, I mean, well, you nailed it on printers."
5599520,5600640," Printer is just too easy."
5600640,5602800," Yeah, that's that's a super low hanging fruit."
5602800,5603800," Yeah."
5603800,5608920," Um, man, I feel like this is the sort of thing that I rant about all the time."
5608920,5614000," I would say I would say voice recognition is a huge disappointment for me, not because"
5614000,5619200," it's terrible compared to what we started with, but because the promises were so much"
5619200,5620560," better than what we ended up with."
5620560,5624480," It took me four attempts to call my wife the other night."
5624480,5626800," I said call Ivanhoe mobile."
5626800,5633160," And the first time it got Ivanhoe mobile, which I don't have a home number listed for her."
5633160,5637360," So I don't know why it would think Ivanhoe anything home, anything, because there is no"
5637360,5638360," home number."
5638360,5640520," So it was just like, I'm sorry, who do you want to reach?"
5640520,5642440," And then I said, Ivanhoe mobile."
5642440,5645000," And it goes Ivanhoe mobile."
5645000,5647560," I don't have an Ivanhoe in my address book."
5647560,5651200," So I try again, Ivanhoe mobile."
5651200,5655280," And it goes, oh man, this is the thing that makes me most angry."
5655280,5661800," You know how it'll do like it'll kind of try to transcribe it to text as you're talking?"
5661800,5662800," So it got it."
5662800,5663800," Ivanhoe mobile."
5663800,5664800," And then it'll change it."
5664800,5665800," And then it'll change it."
5665800,5666800," Yeah."
5666800,5667800," No!"
5667800,5672640," You were so close."
5672640,5678920," You had a perfect match for something on my physical storage on my device."
5678920,5680720," And you undid it."
5680720,5682760," Yeah, that annoys me."
5682760,5684480," I'm going to pick mine as Windows."
5684480,5685480," Really?"
5685480,5687840," And this is actually kind of why."
5687840,5691120," Because I actually, and I know a bunch of people might disagree with me and I don't"
5691120,5695480," really care about that part, but I actually quite like the design aspect of Windows 11."
5695480,5696520," I like how it looks."
5696520,5701480," I even have been one over by the taskbar thing being in the middle."
5701480,5702480," Yeah."
5702480,5703480," No."
5703480,5704480," No."
5704480,5705480," You're objectively wrong."
5705480,5706480," I'm okay with that."
5706480,5707480," No."
5707480,5708480," Because there's an option to move it."
5708480,5709480," Oh, sure."
5709480,5710480," Fine."
5710480,5711480," But like leaving it in the middle is objectively wrong."
5711480,5712480," Sure."
5712480,5713480," But you can put it to the side if you want."
5713480,5714480," Sure."
5714480,5718320," But the search has been completely bastardized."
5718320,5719800," The search just like doesn't work."
5719800,5722560," Yeah, it's amazing how bad the search is since Windows 10."
5722560,5723960," That should not be possible."
5723960,5724960," It shouldn't."
5724960,5725960," It's remarkable."
5725960,5726960," It's crazy."
5726960,5728280," Absolutely crazy."
5728280,5734040," The search is like the main thing Windows is like almost four in a user experience way"
5734040,5735040," at this point."
5735040,5736040," And it's garbage."
5736040,5737040," Like that's--"
5737040,5738480," You mean the start menu."
5738480,5741280," Not the same-- yeah, you said Windows, but the start menu is--"
5741280,5742280," Has basically--"
5742280,5743280," I mean Windows in general."
5743280,5745280," And I'll get into more points in a second."
5745280,5746280," All right."
5746280,5747280," All right."
5747280,5748960," So the start menu is atrocious."
5748960,5753480," And most users aren't going into things like control panel these days and stuff to be completely"
5753480,5754480," honest."
5754480,5755480," Most users are not."
5755480,5759040," So most user interaction with Windows at this point is just the start menu."
5759040,5760040," And the start menu is raw."
5760040,5761040," Or the desktop."
5761040,5762040," Yeah."
5762040,5763040," Fair enough."
5763040,5764040," I know a lot of people who just--"
5764040,5767040," Just the computer is the desktop on the start menu."
5767040,5768320," Yeah, fair enough."
5768320,5774360," The other reason why I'm frustrated is there's certain things that like I feel like Windows"
5774360,5778440," should be doing at this point that it's not."
5778440,5781520," And one of those was like I was talking to my brother about this the other day because"
5781520,5783920," he needed to send me-- I send someone or me."
5783920,5785240," I don't remember what the situation was."
5785240,5787320," But a file transfer needed to happen."
5787320,5788320," Yeah."
5788320,5789720," I get it."
5789720,5791080," How's there no share menu?"
5791080,5794240," Like you have on Android and iOS and macOS, basically everything else."
5794240,5795240," Yeah."
5795240,5796240," How is there no built-in screen recording?"
5796240,5797240," I don't know."
5797240,5801620," But how-- at this point in time, I should be able to have-- and it shouldn't have to"
5801620,5803840," go through OneDrive, OK?"
5803840,5805120," It should be able to tunnel directly."
5805120,5807560," I should be able to have a family group."
5807560,5812880," And if my brother wants to share me some big file, it should be able to set up an encrypted"
5812880,5814440," thing between us and handle it."
5814440,5821000," You, I think, I want to revise my answer because file sharing, it has got to be it for me."
5821000,5822000," Yeah."
5822000,5824040," And like how Windows hasn't taken care of that."
5824040,5831440," How is it that I am sitting here next to you and we cannot transfer at line speed over"
5831440,5838000," a simple A to A USB cable or at full Wi-Fi speed over the hotspot we are both connected"
5838000,5841000," to without going through some-- some--"
5841000,5842000," --onerous--"
5842000,5844920," --genious hand-shaking authentication system."
5844920,5846920," It's like, no, it's fine."
5846920,5847920," It's that guy."
5847920,5848920," It's OK."
5848920,5850520," Just chill."
5850520,5854600," Or the fact that my phone is sitting here and it's not as simple as just like beep boop"
5854600,5855600," and it's on."
5855600,5857400," And now there are ways to do that."
5857400,5862760," Like for example, there's actually pretty good file browsing apps where you can just"
5862760,5865560," dump files into SMB shares on Android."
5865560,5871560," And on iOS for that matter, which is more impressive to me, but it all needs to be premeditated."
5871560,5876480," I can't just spontaneously be sitting in a coffee shop next to someone that I'm meeting"
5876480,5880480," and go, here, let me just drag and drop this file over to you."
5880480,5886920," That is, if Windows 12 doesn't have that, I'm going to be sitting there going, what the"
5886920,5888600," f*ck have they actually been working on?"
5888600,5889600," Because this is like--"
5889600,5890600," Yeah."
5890600,5892360," --I understand there have been improvements, OK?"
5892360,5894760," So just hold on."
5894760,5903040," But what out of the user experience-- not user experience-- in the way that you use Windows,"
5903040,5907000," what has really changed that much since like Vista?"
5907000,5908000," Almost nothing."
5908000,5909000," Yeah."
5909000,5910000," Vista was Vista underrated."
5910000,5913600," And I don't even necessarily want to get into that."
5913600,5916520," But like seriously, there have been improvements."
5916520,5917520," Yes, there's been a bunch of improvements."
5917520,5919520," There's a shell thing now, there's all this kind of stuff."
5919520,5925000," But for the average, normy user, I don't believe that their Windows experience has really"
5925000,5930360," been improved since maybe, you know, maybe the average computer can run it a little better"
5930360,5932000," now, stuff like that."
5932000,5935240," But like, that's not really on them."
5935240,5936800," And search was better in Vista."
5936800,5942960," And it had some innovations that have actually gone away, like the games folder that would"
5942960,5944720," organize all your games for you."
5944720,5945720," Yeah."
5945720,5946720," Like that was pretty cool."
5946720,5950200," Now every piece of software that has to do with gaming has decided they're going to"
5950200,5951200," do it."
5951200,5956880," So I have 87 different game managers on my computer because every graphics thing is"
5956880,5960880," like, oh, you can launch our games through us as if anyone's going to do that."
5960880,5963080," And then also Steam and then also everything else."
5963080,5964720," It's like, oh my god."
5964720,5972760," It's just there's the fact that the games for Windows Live is so terrible, is really"
5972760,5974000," frustrating."
5974000,5980080," Like games for Windows Live, imagine an actually really good version of like the PC"
5980080,5981960," Xbox app for games for Windows Live."
5981960,5986960," I know games for Windows Live is basically just the worst possible DRM."
5986960,5990840," But imagine you were like the PM of that and you could drive the direction."
5990840,5991840," Oh, I could make it awesome."
5991840,5993360," Yeah, it could be maybe."
5993360,5995880," Because you have to get the games industry to cooperate with you."
5995880,5997120," So that's tough."
5997120,6002720," If there's a more fragmented industry, I haven't seen it."
6002720,6006040," But it has potential that has been squandered."
6006040,6007040," That's true."
6007040,6008040," That's fair."
6008040,6011320," And like there's so there's so much you could do with Windows to just make it an awesome"
6011320,6013840," experience."
6013840,6015360," And it's just, ah."
6015360,6018560," Steve J3D says I'm hearing 30 day Vista challenge."
6018560,6019560," Oh god."
6019560,6023040," No, that would actually be very risky for people like us."
6023040,6024920," Because security, yeah."
6024920,6029680," We'd be, we might get harpooned."
6029680,6034160," But like really I'm thinking back to like, okay, from XP to Vista."
6034160,6038640," Yeah, there was some changes in like how I use the computer."
6038640,6045160," But at this point, like my OS upgrades have been for compatibility reasons only."
6045160,6046160," Yeah."
6046160,6050760," I have genuinely not wanted a new OS since seven."
6050760,6052880," Yeah."
6052880,6053880," Like at all."
6053880,6057080," And I look back at screenshots of XP and I feel nostalgic."
6057080,6058880," And I like like the aesthetic and stuff."
6058880,6061960," I look back at screenshots of seven and I'm like, oh yeah."
6061960,6063920," I can just use that now and it'd be completely fine."
6063920,6064920," Yeah."
6064920,6067000," Like I don't know."
6067000,6070160," It's very, it's been disappointing to me."
6070160,6071880," I think that's fair."
6071880,6072880," Yeah."
6072880,6075320," Plus no drivers for Vista."
6075320,6076320," Yeah."
6076320,6079680," But like those are the reasons why people are upgrading compatibility drivers, security,"
6079680,6080680," stuff like that."
6080680,6081720," It's not like, oh wow."
6081720,6084880," There's this new feature in the new one that is really compelling."
6084880,6090680," I can now just because it's my brother and I'm in the Microsoft family group or whatever,"
6090680,6093920," I can send him whatever I file file I want from wherever in the world."
6093920,6095320," Microsoft's going to find a way to tunnel us."
6095320,6097120," We don't have to pay for some extra service."
6097120,6099640," It should be fine."
6099640,6101800," But that's just not possible."
6101800,6103320," Search is just borked."
6103320,6107640," So like I can't find local files because it's constantly just banging things."
6107640,6112240," It's just like, oh my goodness, like it's so rough."
6112240,6113240," I don't know."
6113240,6118480," Like it's even, it's like even worse than the voice thing you were describing where it's"
6118480,6123320," like it's trying to interpret voice and it gets it right and then corrects it to wrong,"
6123320,6125720," which is really bad and dumb."
6125720,6128280," I literally typed this in."
6128280,6129280," Yeah."
6129280,6132200," And it is just like, no room."
6132200,6133200," Yeah."
6133200,6134760," For misinterpretation."
6134760,6138360," And it still is like, ah, there's some local files, but I'm not going to bring them up."
6138360,6140200," I'm just going to bang it."
6140200,6141920," Like, stop."
6141920,6143840," I thought you liked Bing."
6143840,6147120," That's super cool, Giancarlo Sarr."
6147120,6149000," Basically, charity raising thing."
6149000,6150000," That's awesome."
6150000,6151000," Yeah."
6151000,6156920," I don't want to get into LLMs because honestly until GPT-4 comes out, it's like not that interesting."
6156920,6160920," But Bing's been neutered super hard."
6160920,6166280," Let's talk about a new product on LTT Store, but not the one that we're actually launching"
6166280,6168240," this week."
6168240,6173680," We are planning a collab with the original makers of the ModMat."
6173680,6174680," ModRight."
6174680,6175680," Oh."
6175680,6176680," Yeah."
6176680,6183320," We have reached an agreement and principle to move forward, licensing their trademarks"
6183320,6187880," and patents to create a ModMat product."
6187880,6191240," But right now, we're in the very, very early stages."
6191240,6196480," We obviously have some ideas of what we want to make it the best possible ModMat on the"
6196480,6197560," market."
6197560,6203040," Um, you know, obviously the place to start for us was collaborating with the creators"
6203040,6204800," of the original."
6204800,6207040," But there are some things that we want to add."
6207040,6211800," So I don't know how many of these are going to make it from my wish list into an actual"
6211800,6213560," physical product."
6213560,6218360," But some of the ideas that we've had are heat resistant, Dan, I was thinking of you, heat"
6218360,6219360," resistance."
6219360,6222760," So if anyone were to accidentally leave a soldering iron or a hot glue gun or something"
6222760,6223760," like that on one."
6223760,6224760," Did he do this?"
6224760,6225760," No, no."
6225760,6226760," Okay."
6226760,6227760," I just, I think of Dan sometimes."
6227760,6228760," I've got to go back to HQ2."
6228760,6229760," Hold on."
6229760,6230760," Yeah."
6230760,6231760," Yeah."
6231760,6233560," Um, so if someone were to leave a hot item on it."
6233560,6235160," So somebody should have burned through."
6235160,6237160," Maddy McMat face."
6237160,6238160," No."
6238160,6239160," No."
6239160,6243520," Um, I'd love to have some kind of embedded."
6243520,6248520," Um, like screw management, like kind of like embedded magnets."
6248520,6249520," Yeah."
6249520,6256040," You could kind of just stick, uh, stick, like iron containing screws or a ferrous screws"
6256040,6257040," or whatever else."
6257040,6258200," And screw sorting area built into the back."
6258200,6259200," Yeah."
6259200,6261160," Onto, onto like a little spot or maybe it could be an attachment."
6261160,6262160," I don't know."
6262160,6263880," There's lots of different ideas."
6263880,6268600," One idea we have already that I'd really like to move forward with is right now, like"
6268600,6273440," whether you pick up one from U line or even the original mod matter, anything like that."
6273440,6278320," The way that you attach an anti-static strap to it is with that awful like button interface."
6278320,6279320," Yeah."
6279320,6280560," I know it's industry standard or whatever."
6280560,6282320," It's like that's fine."
6282320,6284520," But what if you could make it modular?"
6284520,6288440," So what if you had a really strong magnetic interface that you can stick the button thing"
6288440,6294080," on so that every time you attach your strap, it just sticks onto there."
6294080,6296080," Then you could theoretically use it for something else."
6296080,6298680," Then you could have different pieces."
6298680,6302360," You could have a little, um, like a little, okay, like, you know, like those little wrist"
6302360,6304280," strap, um, things."
6304280,6307520," So they have like a, like a little bar and then you put a thing through it and you tie a wrist"
6307520,6308520," strap onto it."
6308520,6312640," So you could just have like a little bar that you could clip an alligator clamp to."
6312640,6314040," Because I mean, that's super annoying, right?"
6314040,6317040," When you have one of those button interface ones and then you have a wrist strap that"
6317040,6320480," has an alligator clamp, you're like, this doesn't really, this doesn't really go on"
6320480,6321480," here."
6321480,6324680," So if you could have like a modular interface for that and it could be magnetic, that was"
6324680,6326920," one of the ideas that I had."
6326920,6329120," Um, yeah."
6329120,6334160," So anyway, the point is that there is a post in the merch section of the forum."
6334160,6339640," So if you guys have any creative ideas for what you'd like to see in a mod mat, uh, talk"
6339640,6344760," about what you look for, what you like, what you dislike, uh, your favorite, your least"
6344760,6346840," favorite and why."
6346840,6350280," And if you think there are any key features that are missing from any mod mats that are"
6350280,6353120," currently on the market and we are going to try to address it."
6353120,6356320," We want to make the best darn mod mat."
6356320,6361640," And, uh, like I said, really, really excited to be starting from a place where we're, we're"
6361640,6365400," we're working with like the original creators of the mod mat."
6365400,6367080," Um, pretty, pretty cool."
6367080,6372560," I actually still have my original mod, right mod mat on my, uh, build station at home in"
6372560,6373720," the basement."
6373720,6377480," And that was, that was one of the things that sort of prompted me to finally get off my"
6377480,6380280," butt and ask someone else to do something for me."
6380280,6381280," Yeah."
6381280,6382280," Nick was the one who reached out."
6382280,6384560," You noticed like, this is a literal old."
6384560,6385560," Yeah."
6385560,6386560," Pretty old."
6386560,6387960," And I was like, yeah, like what happened to these guys?"
6387960,6388960," Oh, they're still around."
6388960,6389960," Okay."
6389960,6393000," Why don't we reach out because I think that would be awesome."
6393000,6394000," Very excited."
6394000,6395640," Can you buy theirs anymore?"
6395640,6396640," I actually don't know."
6396640,6397640," That's a good question."
6397640,6401360," Don't seem to be able to on their site, but I don't know."
6401360,6405000," They still have copyright 2013, which was pretty sick."
6405000,6406720," Oh, yeah."
6406720,6407720," Yeah."
6407720,6408720," Yeah."
6408720,6410080," Actually mentioned this before the show."
6410080,6411760," They're still advertising Firefox three."
6411760,6412760," Cool."
6412760,6413760," Oh, there you go."
6413760,6414760," Yeah."
6414760,6416760," Look at this."
6416760,6419920," Hey, my unboxing."
6419920,6421720," This video must still be around."
6421720,6422960," Wow."
6422960,6423960," That's awesome."
6423960,6426560," Modrite ModMad unboxing video."
6426560,6436240," Just casual nine year old video, June 13th, 2013, almost 10 years old."
6436240,6437720," Nice."
6437720,6438720," Nice."
6438720,6440120," Wow."
6440120,6441120," That's awesome."
6441120,6442600," Oh, yeah."
6442600,6443600," No, this is the one."
6443600,6444600," Oh, wait."
6444600,6445600," Is this the one I have at home?"
6445600,6446600," I'm not sure."
6446600,6447600," It might be the bigger one."
6447600,6450240," Oh, no, it wasn't seeing it at home that prompted me."
6450240,6453360," It was seeing the one on Dan's desk."
6453360,6456480," So I have one of these and then Dan, you have one of these on your desk too, right?"
6456480,6457480," That's right."
6457480,6459000," Yeah, I do all my electronics on it."
6459000,6460560," I came with my desk."
6460560,6461560," This one, right?"
6461560,6462560," That's the one."
6462560,6463560," Yeah."
6463560,6464560," That might be the one I'm still using."
6464560,6465560," I've seen that around a few times."
6465560,6466560," Oh, my God, I'm having my own starstruck moment."
6466560,6470600," I get to use realignices, ModMad."
6470600,6472440," Just relax, okay?"
6472440,6476520," Oh, yes, that is the actual one from that video nine years ago."
6476520,6478480," I'm still going strong nine years later, right?"
6478480,6479480," It's literally perfect."
6479480,6482520," I'm not a guest that has been in use for nine years."
6482520,6483520," It's amazing."
6483520,6485320," Yeah, so we're going for it."
6485320,6486320," We're going for it."
6486320,6487320," I'm really excited."
6487320,6488640," I think we've got the right starting point."
6488640,6495080," I think we've got some really good ideas to evolve what is sitting at my build station"
6495080,6497520," and what's on your desk."
6497520,6498520," That's going to be good."
6498520,6501120," Okay, we will finally talk about the product we're launching this week."
6501120,6510120," I didn't let Luke touch it, but this is one that has been in the works for good gravy."
6510120,6514160," I'm pretty sure we started this before Bridget joined."
6514160,6515160," Whoa, okay."
6515160,6516760," Wait, no, is that quite right?"
6516760,6519000," No, it must have been very early in her tenure."
6519000,6522000," So it's been well over a year in development."
6522000,6531200," So we completely missed an entire spring, winter, fall cycle of availability that we"
6531200,6532280," had targeted."
6532280,6538840," And we are now through the fall and winter and getting dangerously close to the spring"
6538840,6541960," of the next target for it."
6541960,6544560," But we wanted to take the time to get it right."
6544560,6545640," And it's finally here."
6545640,6547840," It's the 3D down jacket."
6547840,6549600," Do I go now?"
6549600,6550600," We did a..."
6550600,6551600," Oh, is that..."
6551600,6552600," That's yours."
6552600,6553600," That's yours."
6553600,6554600," Oh, no, this isn't mine."
6554600,6555600," This is the small."
6555600,6556600," I have a mine in my backpack."
6556600,6557600," Oh."
6557600,6559000," Okay, so yeah, you get to play with it now."
6559000,6564280," So what's really cool about this thing is the material."
6564280,6565280," Sometimes..."
6565280,6566280," It feels nice."
6566280,6571920," Sometimes you start the product development process with a garment you're trying to create."
6571920,6576320," The shirt that Luke is wearing, for example, we set out to create a t-shirt that was really"
6576320,6579400," comfortable and blah, blah, blah, etc."
6579400,6584120," And we sought a material to make it out of."
6584120,6585760," They can't see any of that."
6585760,6588040," Actually, Dan, do you want to man the camera?"
6588040,6590120," Hold on, let me redo it."
6590120,6596360," With the 3D down jacket, we found this really cool material."
6596360,6599240," It's not quite down."
6599240,6605680," It's not quite 3D printed, but there is a down layer out of the, I believe it's 11 layers"
6605680,6607080," on the jacket."
6607080,6609080," Let me double check."
6609080,6613680," 3D printed down fabric features, stain resistant, breathable, four-way stretch, like weight,"
6613680,6615680," heat retention, wind resistant, water resistant."
6615680,6616680," It's not..."
6616680,6622120," Okay, it's not 3D printed in the same way that you would imagine like a plastic part,"
6622120,6624720," but it is an additive process."
6624720,6626200," Did I just..."
6626200,6627360," Oh, hello, Dan."
6627360,6630920," It's like, is this a video of how it's made?"
6630920,6631920," Wow."
6631920,6637040," But it is laid down with an additive process that deposits the fibers rather than weaving"
6637040,6638040," them."
6638040,6643000," And what that allows you to do is it allows you to have this kind of cobweb pattern that"
6643000,6648440," puts room between them for better breathability, and it also makes the insulation absolutely"
6648440,6650920," fantastic for the thickness."
6650920,6652800," So yeah, check it out."
6652800,6655280," The outer shell is a blend of nylon spandex."
6655280,6656680," One of the best YKK."
6656680,6657680," So of course."
6657680,6660400," Yeah, YK zipper, water resistant?"
6660400,6661880," Yep."
6661880,6665240," Of course."
6665240,6666840," All the seams are taped."
6666840,6671440," I believe it's 18,000 millimeters of water resistance."
6671440,6676560," We never call anything waterproof, water resistance, internal pockets."
6676560,6682840," But what's really special about it is the 3D down or a 3D printed down or whatever you"
6682840,6684040," kind of want to call it."
6684040,6686040," There is a down component to it."
6686040,6691640," But the interior material, because it's super insulating, it's really comfy."
6691640,6696920," So if you're the kind of person like me and like I assume Luke who would just be in a"
6696920,6702000," t-shirt even in fairly adverse weather but might want a jacket when he goes outside,"
6702000,6704960," it's really, really nice on the skin."
6704960,6707560," We spent a lot of time on getting the fit just right."
6707560,6710520," There is a little bit of stretch in the outer shell though."
6710520,6712120," It's breathable with good wind resistance."
6712120,6714800," It's reasonably water resistant."
6714800,6715960," It's lightweight."
6715960,6718720," I just absolutely love this thing."
6718720,6719720," It looks really sharp."
6719720,6721800," Is there any branding on it?"
6721800,6722800," Just a little bit."
6722800,6723800," I haven't seen any."
6723800,6727400," On the very bottom right I think of the bottom there."
6727400,6730440," Yeah, if you stand up, maybe we'll be able to see it."
6730440,6733520," Whoop, whoop, and he waxed the thing."
6733520,6736840," There's a little, can you see it?"
6736840,6739360," There's like little dots that make a little LTT."
6739360,6741360," We're going for really subtle branding on this."
6741360,6743120," We wanted it to just look really clean."
6743120,6745520," I'm trying to show it on."
6745520,6746520," It's a little hard."
6746520,6747520," Yeah, don't worry about it."
6747520,6748720," It's fine."
6748720,6757440," The point is that it's light, it's comfy, it's super, super warm for the weight."
6757440,6758880," And the hood is big enough."
6758880,6761080," That was something that we actually really struggled with."
6761080,6762080," Huge."
6762080,6763080," Yeah."
6763080,6764080," I like huge hoods."
6764080,6766800," They're good because if you wanted to wear a tube or something under it, you actually"
6766800,6767800," can."
6767800,6772080," But there's two things that, okay, again, this took a while."
6772080,6775840," You can adjust the hood such that, and the way that it pulls on it, it doesn't have to"
6775840,6776840," be huge."
6776840,6779520," And there's adjustments around the bottom as well."
6779520,6783320," Another thing that took us kind of forever together, there's another one on the other"
6783320,6784520," side."
6784520,6788200," Another thing that took us forever to get right is the adhesive on the sleeves."
6788200,6792320," So the sleeves air a little bit on the long side because we've gotten really good feedback"
6792320,6796280," from people about long sleeves."
6796280,6799520," But obviously, if you want them to stay in place, you're going to have to have adjuster"
6799520,6800520," things."
6800520,6805280," Okay, but hold that up to the mic while you rip it off."
6805280,6806280," It's really strong."
6806280,6807280," Yeah."
6807280,6810960," It will not come off and it's not like your typical hook and loop path fastener."
6810960,6816960," If you look at it closely, it's like a really cool one that really definitely super does"
6816960,6817960," not come apart."
6817960,6818960," Okay."
6818960,6819960," Yeah."
6819960,6823800," So this is a nice, like almost like rubbery, like soft touch textile to it too."
6823800,6824800," Yeah."
6824800,6830280," I am so, so happy with this thing."
6830280,6831760," It's really nice."
6831760,6833200," It's really expensive."
6833200,6834840," Thanks, Dan."
6834840,6838920," It's a $250 jacket."
6838920,6842520," Our cost is pretty high because these materials are..."
6842520,6844160," Feels too nice to know."
6844160,6846520," Really expensive."
6846520,6855160," But like, yeah, it is what it is."
6855160,6857640," People, you know, it's a really funny thing."
6857640,6861720," Whenever we talk about pricing for stuff, there's two camps."
6861720,6866480," There's the...oh my God, I would never spend more than $30 on a jacket camp."
6866480,6867480," And then there's the..."
6867480,6868480," Which is fine."
6868480,6869480," That seems cheap."
6869480,6872000," I would never spend less than $600 on a jacket camp."
6872000,6874280," This is also fine, I guess."
6874280,6879320," And then there's shockingly little middle ground."
6879320,6888960," It's a really interesting thing seeing everyone's different perception of value."
6888960,6891520," Yeah."
6891520,6893520," It's an interesting observation."
6893520,6899440," WB something anyway, whatever, in Twitch chat says, $250 without a parent branding is weird."
6899440,6902280," I feel like people who shop on LTT want it to be known."
6902280,6904720," We want it to stand without the brand."
6904720,6906720," That's a big part of what we're..."
6906720,6909080," I was happy that there was subtle branding."
6909080,6910080," Yeah."
6910080,6914480," Like, I like that personally."
6914480,6918920," So I'm looking for...I've seen a lot of people picking them up in the merch messages today."
6918920,6922000," And I'm looking forward to seeing people's feedback on the store."
6922000,6924880," If you're not convinced, don't believe me."
6924880,6925960," Believe what people post on the store."
6925960,6930120," I mean, our reviews are basically always excellent."
6930120,6931880," I really like the feel of the materials."
6931880,6933560," I'm really confident in this one."
6933560,6934560," Yeah."
6934560,6936360," This one's a killer."
6936360,6939920," It's taken long enough."
6939920,6941240," I want LTT branding low key."
6941240,6942240," I get that."
6942240,6944240," I could see people wanting it."
6944240,6947240," So I am someone who went to a lot of shows."
6947240,6948880," I went to a lot of conventions."
6948880,6954120," And my clothing for many, many years was effectively comprised of convention clubs."
6954120,6955120," Jaming companies."
6955120,6956120," Yeah."
6956120,6957120," TAT companies."
6957120,6958120," Yeah."
6958120,6960280," And now it's comprised of LTT store merch."
6960280,6961280," Yeah."
6961280,6965840," And it's kind of nice to have some nice things."
6965840,6967280," This is a very nice jacket."
6967280,6968960," It's not a cheap jacket."
6968960,6972240," I'm kind of happy that it isn't covered in branding."
6972240,6973240," Right?"
6973240,6976000," Like, you could wear this out to somewhere very nice."
6976000,6977000," Yeah, of course."
6977000,6979600," It would look really sharp because it's really sharp."
6979600,6985400," The thing is that stuff is designed a lot of the time for, like, I need to wear it."
6985400,6986400," Yeah."
6986400,6987400," Yeah."
6987400,6991240," I don't want to be like, you guys got to think about this, right?"
6991240,6998640," On Saturday, I don't want to be a billboard for LTT, actually."
6998640,7003240," I don't want to get approached because people recognize the merch."
7003240,7004240," The logo, yeah."
7004240,7005240," Necessarily."
7005240,7006240," Yeah."
7006240,7012280," Putting together like an outerwear item, I'm kind of sitting here going once in a while."
7012280,7013280," Like I'm into it."
7013280,7015760," I'll wear my swack it out or whatever."
7015760,7022760," But if it's raining and miserable and I'm cranky, I just want to black jacket."
7022760,7024560," Don't talk to me."
7024560,7026240," To be clear, it's fine to talk to me."
7026240,7027240," I'm super down."
7027240,7030440," I just mean, I don't want it to be so loud."
7030440,7033960," It's also kind of better, like, at least in my opinion, if someone just recognizes you"
7033960,7038040," as you instead of being like, I have seen that logo on the internet, you must be the"
7038040,7039680," guy, you know?"
7039680,7042120," I don't know."
7042120,7043120," That's me at least."
7043120,7044120," All right."
7044120,7045120," Let's move on."
7045120,7046120," Next topic."
7046120,7048840," Secret shopper update."
7048840,7054400," No details on the date, but obviously, at some point, we will be working on another round"
7054400,7057200," of Secret shopper or maybe we're already working on it."
7057200,7058560," Who knows?"
7058560,7063720," But during the last round, the company that wound up well behind the pack was Del Alien"
7063720,7065800," Wear."
7065800,7070320," After promising up and down after the first Secret shopper that they had completely overhauled"
7070320,7075240," their customer service standards, their terrible pushy customer service got us an overpriced"
7075240,7079880," underperforming gaming computer that earned them dead last."
7079880,7085160," Del is a once again asking you to sorry, Del is once again promising that they've changed."
7085160,7089920," They've really changed this time and they have instated extensive diagnostics and quality"
7089920,7093600," control measures to find gaps in their customer service."
7093600,7098200," They also claim that they have dialed back sales incentives and increased focus on customer"
7098200,7103200," satisfaction scores, which was a key criticism that we made about the incentives for their"
7103200,7105480," sales team at the time."
7105480,7110320," There is no word on whether they've increased base salary for reps, which we also brought"
7110320,7115880," up and is a key part of what makes those commission incentives so tantalizing because"
7115880,7121600," as far as I could tell, these people were desperate, absolutely desperate to sell these"
7121600,7130600," warranties and on site services and financing because clearly there was, I don't know,"
7130600,7133880," sometimes you get a vibe sometimes, right?"
7133880,7138800," Where it's like, this is not just training, like this is survival."
7138800,7139800," Yeah."
7139800,7142280," Was how I felt about it?"
7142280,7152000," So I told Del, all right, I'll pass this along, but I'm not your PR department."
7152000,7155280," I'm not a mouthpiece for you guys."
7155280,7158360," I am passing this along for only one reason."
7158360,7166280," The reason I'm passing it along is so that now you guys and us and Del are all on the"
7166280,7170480," same page that it should be really good."
7170480,7179000," So when Secret Shopper happened or happened, I really hope that we do not find the same"
7179000,7182080," things that we did last time."
7182080,7187000," Because unprompted, okay, this is an email that landed in my inbox."
7187000,7188000," Hold on a second."
7188000,7193800," Let me just check something real quick here because I think it was pretty much out of"
7193800,7198320," the blue, like out of absolutely nowhere."
7198320,7201320," Yeah."
7201320,7204640," Here we go."
7204640,7209640," Okay, so my first outreach about this was in 2020."
7209640,7216560," So I heard from my Del contact who put me in touch with Director of Communications for"
7216560,7221120," Client Solutions Group, something something, something, something, okay."
7221120,7225720," And I basically went, yeah, you know, good luck with that."
7225720,7232680," Okay, I didn't hear anything for over a year since December of 2020."
7232680,7237280," And then I randomly got an email from this person on January the 6th and then I just"
7237280,7241520," have put off dealing with it until then."
7241520,7243200," But it's like this long thing."
7243200,7248040," Oh, that's pretty much like here's all the ways that we're fixing everything."
7248040,7252800," And so I'm sitting here going, if you are completely unprompted, essentially, going"
7252800,7256600," to send me this list of ways that you're doing way better."
7256600,7257600," Something might have changed."
7257600,7263320," I expect it to darn well be better when it comes time to have a look at it."
7263320,7265280," Yeah."
7265280,7267240," So good luck with that."
7267240,7268280," That time might not be now."
7268280,7269440," We still can't tell you."
7269440,7271280," What else do you want to talk about?"
7271280,7273200," I'm kind of scrolling through right now."
7273200,7274920," We did all the main topics."
7274920,7278240," It looks like farewell to the Fairphone too."
7278240,7279240," See ya."
7279240,7280240," Yeah."
7280240,7282560," Last security update this month?"
7282560,7283560," Seven years."
7283560,7284560," Wow."
7284560,7288920," After it first launched, they only promised three to five years of updates back in 2015"
7288920,7292240," and they will apparently continue to sell parts while supplies last."
7292240,7295800," If you wish to continue using a Fairphone too, you'll have the option of installing a customer"
7295800,7301720," on like LineageOS or trading it in for a 50 euro voucher for Fairphone's E-Store."
7301720,7306680," So the discussion question here is it's clearly possible to make a profit with a modular long-lasting"
7306680,7307680," phone."
7307680,7311600," What would happen if a major manufacturer took the lead with a genuinely sustainable high-powered"
7311600,7312600," phone?"
7312600,7317320," Well, hell would freeze over I guess because the direction the industry has been going has"
7317320,7319840," been the complete opposite of that."
7319840,7321840," Yeah, not that."
7321840,7326400," And I don't know, their investors would probably be mad because I don't think you can make"
7326400,7327400," as much money."
7327400,7329200," I mean, that's the problem."
7329200,7330200," Right?"
7330200,7331200," Always."
7331200,7342320," Always proven with LTT Store that you can make money and not be super toxic about it,"
7342320,7347440," but can you make enough to satisfy investors?"
7347440,7349280," Because it's not enough to be profitable."
7349280,7351280," I mean, we've talked about this a ton."
7351280,7354000," You have to be more profitable than the other guys."
7354000,7355000," That's because you're certain about our best."
7355000,7356320," More profitable than last year."
7356320,7357320," Yeah."
7357320,7358320," Yeah."
7358320,7368240," In a finite world, how can you expect infinite growth?"
7368240,7374160," And like a lot of different places, even if they can't have growth, it doesn't mean they're"
7374160,7375640," not successful."
7375640,7376640," Yeah."
7376640,7381880," Their current amount of profit might be very healthy and they might have saturated the"
7381880,7384800," market and that's fine."
7384800,7387720," And they can keep doing better and they keep innovating to keep that profit level where"
7387720,7389320," it is and that's not a bad thing."
7389320,7391520," But places just only go on growth."
7391520,7392520," Yeah."
7392520,7394880," People are like, yeah, it's never enough to satisfy investors."
7394880,7397800," Yeah, 100% exactly."
7397800,7404080," Speaking of investors, AceTech says they are optimistic despite rough financial seas."
7404080,7410000," So AceTech, you might not know of them because they don't have much of a consumer-facing"
7410000,7416960," brand anymore, but they are best known for their LCLC or low-cost liquid cooling solutions,"
7416960,7422920," the likes of which that you would have seen over the years resold by companies like Courser."
7422920,7428760," Or I mean, Courser I think is really the biggest partner, but also system integrators."
7428760,7433960," They had a pretty weak last year and they have now reported a 47% drop-in revenue in"
7433960,7436800," the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to 2021."
7436800,7441400," The tax sector is taking an absolute pounding."
7441400,7443440," Like I mean that in every sense."
7443440,7444440," Yeah."
7444440,7445440," It's bad."
7445440,7450000," And the Intel's last results are like they lost like $700 million or something like that."
7450000,7454760," Like I'm just, I'm looking at this going, holy shnikes, are these guys going to survive?"
7454760,7455760," Oh yeah, they are."
7455760,7456760," They're just going to lay everyone off."
7456760,7457760," Okay, cool."
7457760,7458760," So that's great."
7458760,7463880," But anyway, they reported a 47% drop-in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to 2021."
7463880,7469520," I remember thinking about this when the pandemic boom happened and all those computer sales"
7469520,7470520," happened."
7470520,7472240," And I was like, okay."
7472240,7473340," Yeah."
7473340,7476660," You guys are riding high on this and you're super excited."
7476660,7478320," But here's the thing."
7478320,7481520," There's a finite number of computers that I need."
7481520,7482520," Yeah."
7482520,7488120," And I feel like it's a lot more than what most people need."
7488120,7490600," Like I'm obviously kidding."
7490600,7491840," I have a lot of computers."
7491840,7496140," And partially due to the conversation we had earlier about Windows, but also due to a"
7496140,7500560," lot of other reasons, there isn't a huge reason to upgrade that quickly these days."
7500560,7505780," The upgrade cycle has, from what I can see, gotten longer."
7505780,7512460," And so if you guys are selling twice as many computers today, there's going to be a reckoning."
7512460,7514260," Sorry, I got to throw this out there."
7514260,7520740," Jonathan in Flowplane Chat saying the tech sector is getting straight up LTT bagged is"
7520740,7522500," hilarious and very difficult."
7522500,7526060," Thank you for that."
7526060,7527980," So the reckoning is here."
7527980,7531040," People just don't need a new computer."
7531040,7532040," Yeah."
7532040,7540240," I really do think it's partly economic uncertainty, but also partly people just straight up not"
7540240,7542280," needing a new computer."
7542280,7546840," And when there's economic uncertainty, wants somewhat go out the window, right?"
7546840,7551720," So like, even if you're like, oh, I could run this game slightly faster."
7551720,7554720," Most games are really easy to run these days anyways, to be completely honest."
7554720,7555720," But yeah."
7555720,7562720," They reported an overall operating loss of $5.4 million in part due to property equipment"
7562720,7565860," and development investments of $22.2 million."
7565860,7568780," This drop is likely due to the same market contractions that have been affecting other"
7568780,7570600," computer parts manufacturers."
7570600,7573720," In the same quarter, they announced their eighth gen coolers and sales are currently"
7573720,7575320," trending slowly upwards."
7575320,7578000," So they believe the market is stabilizing that they have the financial health to maintain"
7578000,7579760," operations until conditions improve."
7579760,7583300," Anyway, the main reason for this is not that I think you guys particularly care about"
7583300,7590620," base attack, but it was just an excuse to talk about how that boom and bust has definitely"
7590620,7591620," happened."
7591620,7594520," And it's yeah, it's kind of scary because there's definitely going to be some smaller"
7594520,7600340," players that are struggling more than the Intel's and AMD's and Microsoft's of the world."
7600340,7605300," Speaking of struggling, have you ever struggled to get your printer to work after you installed"
7605300,7612340," third party ink because HP was all like, you and pushed a firmware that prevented the use"
7612340,7616940," of ink cartridges without HP chips in them?"
7616940,7618500," This sucks."
7618500,7620340," This sucks so much."
7620340,7623820," I love my old Samsung laser printer."
7623820,7627420," I have like an ML 2010 or something like that, 2020."
7627420,7628420," I can't remember."
7628420,7632420," It was like, it has a sticker on it that's like world's most compact color laser printer."
7632420,7635020," So whichever one that is."
7635020,7639580," And when Samsung sold their printer business to HP, I didn't really think about it at"
7639580,7640580," the time."
7640580,7646740," But the only way that HP could extract a ton of value from that, aside from just eliminating"
7646740,7653180," a competitor, had to be to engage in these kinds of toxic anti-consumer practices."
7653180,7654180," Oh yeah."
7654180,7661820," HP is essentially making it so your printer won't work if you have ink in it that doesn't"
7661820,7665340," have an HP chip in it."
7665340,7668940," They've engaged in similar behavior for years using the rationale."
7668940,7669940," And this is a joke."
7669940,7676260," Remember back in NCIX, I had to sit through a presentation like this from an HP rep explaining"
7676260,7679980," the consumer benefits of first party ink."
7679980,7682580," And I'm sitting here going, no."
7682580,7685180," You know I have whole jars of ink at home."
7685180,7688060," And I'm going to keep using them with my little syringes."
7688060,7692380," And they're talking about the technology of the nanodroplets or whatever."
7692380,7693380," I'm like, yeah, sure."
7693380,7695860," If I was a professional printing house, by all means."
7695860,7703820," But I just need to hand in my stupid report and I need a colored bar graph on it or whatever."
7703820,7708580," So they've used the rationale that they're ensuring the customer experience."
7708580,7712500," But courts in three different countries have ruled against them in multiple class action"
7712500,7715620," lawsuits with penalties worth millions of dollars."
7715620,7716900," That's the problem though."
7716900,7721620," Millions of dollars is just cost of doing business to a company that's operating at HP scale."
7721620,7724740," We've been talking about wimpy fines on the Wancho."
7724740,7728260," The whole time the Wancho has existed, I'm so tired of it."
7728260,7729540," They need to crank these."
7729540,7731940," It needs to actually hurt the companies."
7731940,7737020," When the fine is significantly less than the profit they're going to have by just continuing"
7737020,7738180," to do it."
7738180,7744180," There's this quote of somebody talking about how certain things are just different for"
7744180,7745580," the rich."
7745580,7748620," And it's talking about parking downtown."
7748620,7752020," And they're like, yeah, parking ticket for some people is really brutal."
7752020,7758500," Parking ticket for other people is just like how you pay to park your car."
7758500,7759500," They don't actually care."
7759500,7760500," It doesn't matter."
7760500,7761500," It doesn't impact them."
7761500,7765500," It's still more efficient for them to just park illegally and pay the fine than it is"
7765500,7767580," to go park properly."
7767580,7769220," It's the same problem."
7769220,7774100," Final Fantasy Tactics doesn't have a great translation in its original North American"
7774100,7775100," release."
7775100,7776540," But this is a gem."
7776540,7781740," We graph says, if the penalty for a crime is a fine, that law only exists for the lower"
7781740,7782740," classes."
7782740,7783740," That's 100% true."
7783740,7784740," Yeah."
7784740,7785740," Yeah."
7785740,7786740," Totally."
7786740,7791340," And this fine, if it's not more than what they're benefiting from doing this, they're"
7791340,7793980," just going to keep doing it because they're still profiting off of it."
7793980,7794980," It doesn't work."
7794980,7797780," Have you still not played Final Fantasy Tactics?"
7797780,7798780," No."
7798780,7800660," It is so good."
7800660,7801780," It is so good."
7801780,7804180," I think they released it on Android."
7804180,7806260," There is no excuse, sir."
7806260,7810740," You need to play Final Fantasy Tactics because aside from the stellar gameplay, and it really"
7810740,7815820," is good and it really does hold up, the story is outstanding."
7815820,7818540," Everything is morally ambiguous."
7818540,7822620," And it's not clear who the good guys are and who the bad guys are."
7822620,7826380," And it's deep and it's wonderful."
7826380,7827380," What is wattle?"
7827380,7828380," Wattle."
7828380,7829380," Or the war of the lions."
7829380,7830980," Is it Final Fantasy Tactics War of the Lions?"
7830980,7831980," Well, it depends."
7831980,7837660," So one of the releases I think like the advanced release, I don't know, there's multiple releases"
7837660,7838660," of the game."
7838660,7841860," The best ones I think is like a more updated version of it."
7841860,7842860," Okay."
7842860,7843860," Yeah."
7843860,7845460," Final Fantasy Tactics."
7845460,7846660," So good."
7846660,7848460," So good."
7848460,7852780," AMD drivers have been working computers with a rare bug."
7852780,7855900," They can put computers into a boot loop rendering them inoperable."
7855900,7859700," AMD has acknowledged the problem a month after it was first noticed and has helped at least"
7859700,7862820," one computer journalist through a complicated workaround."
7862820,7867060," The glitch only occurs when installing the AMD GPU driver, opting for a factory reset"
7867060,7871220," clean installation, then having the misfortune of having Windows automatically update in"
7871220,7872220," the background."
7872220,7873860," It's always Windows Update."
7873860,7878060," Speaking of things that just should be way better by now, no permanent fix yet exists,"
7878060,7882900," but it can be avoided by updating Windows before performing any installations."
7882900,7885780," We have some LTX Expo updates."
7885780,7888220," Ooh, this is exciting."
7888220,7893540," ASUS ROG is our title sponsor for LTX 2023."
7893540,7894540," Let's go."
7894540,7896540," Thanks ASUS ROG."
7896540,7899940," So, Ubiquiti is our title sponsor for the whale land."
7899940,7903300," I knew they were going to provide networking equipment, but that's awesome."
7903300,7905020," Since when does Ubiquiti ever spend money?"
7905020,7906020," Well, why not?"
7906020,7907860," It's a legitimate question."
7907860,7908860," That's fair."
7908860,7911220," It's like asking when does Nvidia ever spend money?"
7911220,7916700," Actually, it's not like asking that because the difference is that Ubiquiti has a philosophy"
7916700,7922060," of building products that sell themselves and Nvidia is just the cheapest b**** on the"
7922060,7924220," entire face of the earth."
7924220,7928220," It's a completely separate problem."
7928220,7929980," And oh, this is cool."
7929980,7936020," Epic Games XPC Build Simulator 2 sponsorship for the water cooling workshop booth."
7936020,7939780," We're also going to be working with EK water blocks, details coming in a future update."
7939780,7945980," I haven't seen Rod in the chat today, but I assume you guys are coming up, right?"
7945980,7946980," Gosh."
7946980,7950980," I mean, if Bob and Rod aren't there, is it really LTX?"
7950980,7951980," Have they missed one?"
7951980,7952980," I don't think so."
7952980,7953980," What about the first one?"
7953980,7954980," Where are they at?"
7954980,7955980," The first one?"
7955980,7956980," 2017 was the first one, right?"
7956980,7957980," Trying to remember."
7957980,7958980," That was..."
7958980,7961420," The first one's like a... it's a blur for me."
7961420,7963420," They weren't involved in running the first one."
7963420,7969220," I know that, but they have hosted booths for us at the last couple and those guys are"
7969220,7970220," absolutely..."
7970220,7971220," They've been at the good ones."
7971220,7972220," Chads."
7972220,7973220," Yeah, Rod's in there."
7973220,7974220," I'll be at LTX."
7974220,7975220," Heck yeah."
7975220,7978260," Has anyone reached out to you about doing something at LTX though?"
7978260,7980820," Because we'd love to have you..."
7980820,7982060," We'd love to have both of you there."
7982060,7986900," I know you can't necessarily speak for Bob, but yeah, we can take this conversation offline."
7986900,7989180," Like literally offline."
7989180,7990180," And we can chat."
7990180,7991180," Yeah, this is awesome."
7991180,7993100," Oh, they had a wall pewter at the first one."
7993100,7994940," Oh, that's right."
7994940,7995940," Cool."
7995940,7996940," Yes."
7996940,8000060," So they have been involved as exhibitors every single time."
8000060,8001660," Oh, I love it."
8001660,8005020," It wouldn't be LTX without Bob and Rod."
8005020,8007060," Okay, cool."
8007060,8008060," Looking forward to it."
8008060,8009380," Oh, what else?"
8009380,8012020," Oh, hide image URLs on stream."
8012020,8013020," Okay."
8013020,8014700," Oh, this is awesome."
8014700,8020460," We're going to have some special designer edition desk pads."
8020460,8023820," What exactly these have to do with LTX?"
8023820,8029340," Hard to say, but our designers have been hard at work creating some of the coolest desk"
8029340,8031860," pads that you are ever going to see."
8031860,8034620," I'm going to start with Sarah's design."
8034620,8035620," What do you think?"
8035620,8036620," These are..."
8036620,8037620," I've sneak peeked all the..."
8037620,8038620," Oh, you looked at all them."
8038620,8039620," Dang it, Lou."
8039620,8040620," These are actually so sick."
8040620,8041620," Come on, man."
8041620,8043140," I really like the..."
8043140,8045020," Did you play Far Cry?"
8045020,8048020," Blood, whatever."
8048020,8049020," Blood, whatever."
8049020,8050420," I like Glance that."
8050420,8051660," I didn't really play play."
8051660,8052660," I should."
8052660,8053660," It gives me..."
8053660,8054660," You don't have to play through the whole thing."
8054660,8055660," Okay."
8055660,8056660," Just like give it like an hour or two."
8056660,8057660," It's fun and then it gets old."
8057660,8060540," But it's fun for the first bit."
8060540,8062580," It reminds me a lot of that and it's great."
8062580,8063940," I love the colors."
8063940,8065340," I love the pixelization."
8065340,8066940," The prehistoric tech."
8066940,8067940," Yeah."
8067940,8071580," You know, and Sarah's a big, big dinosaur lady."
8071580,8074180," I think would be one way of putting it."
8074180,8075180," Very cool."
8075180,8077260," So that's one of them."
8077260,8084380," The next one to show you guys is from Lloyd, who is one of our longtime designers that"
8084380,8087460," many of you will probably have..."
8087460,8090340," If you've ever bought anything from LTT Store.com, let's say this."
8090340,8094940," If you've bought more than one thing from LTT Store.com, there's a solid chance you've"
8094940,8097100," worn a Lloyd pen."
8097100,8099100," Okay?"
8099100,8102940," So he did a Vancouver skyline."
8102940,8108860," I think this is cool as specifically potentially a memorabilia piece for LTTX itself."
8108860,8109860," Yes."
8109860,8113380," Because we're like, I don't know if we're on in frame here."
8113380,8114380," We're gonna be here."
8114380,8115380," Okay."
8115380,8116380," Yeah."
8116380,8117380," That is it."
8117380,8118380," Yeah."
8118380,8120780," So here's the convention center and then we've got some other iconic elements of the Vancouver"
8120780,8121780," skyline."
8121780,8123140," Super cool."
8123140,8125220," I haven't seen this actually printed yet."
8125220,8127540," I really hope that IRL."
8127540,8133900," It says vibrant and bold as the work that he's done here, but super cool."
8133900,8141180," And then finally, this is a new person you'll be meeting."
8141180,8145980," Some of you, if you just hang around on our corporate website, might know Maria, or you"
8145980,8152500," might see her in shorts or behind the scenes or stuff like that."
8152500,8160140," But she aside from just doing our thumbnails also has some pretty strong design jobs."
8160140,8165460," So she put together what she's calling zero gravity gaming, which is just a really fun,"
8165460,8168900," vibrant design that I meant."
8168900,8174700," When I saw this, they didn't tell me who did it and I didn't manage to guess because"
8174700,8181500," I confess I kind of thought of her as the thumbnail person and not as just like, well,"
8181500,8182500," because I don't think..."
8182500,8183500," That's other things."
8183500,8184500," Yeah, I don't think..."
8184500,8185500," So what thumbnails make?"
8185500,8187420," Yeah, we didn't really hire her as a graphic designer."
8187420,8190180," I mean, sort of, because thumbnails are that."
8190180,8196580," But we didn't intend to have her just do general design work, especially not for like"
8196580,8198900," merch or whatever, but I think she did an absolutely bang up job."
8198900,8200900," I absolutely love it."
8200900,8207020," So the only hard part is going to be figuring out which one to choose."
8207020,8208580," So are these local only?"
8208580,8210020," So you can only get these at LTX?"
8210020,8211300," I don't know."
8211300,8217380," They say LTX 2023 on the image frame."
8217380,8218380," But yeah, I don't know."
8218380,8219380," Yeah, I'm not sure."
8219380,8220380," I'm super excited though."
8220380,8221540," I'm super excited."
8221540,8222540," They're super cool."
8222540,8223540," Yeah, super sweet."
8223540,8224780," We should do some merch messages."
8224780,8225780," Dan, hit me."
8225780,8226780," All right."
8226780,8228900," I've got an anonymous one here."
8228900,8231500," Linus and Luke regarding lab funding."
8231500,8237220," Have you thought about trying to secure grants from the government, consumer research, and"
8237220,8241220," testing feels like something it might be possible to get grants for?"
8241220,8245460," Are we doing any shred credit stuff?"
8245460,8248140," Not for my team."
8248140,8249140," I'm pretty sure--"
8249140,8250140," Not yet, at least."
8250140,8254540," I'm pretty sure there's some stuff that we're doing that is eligible for shred credits, which"
8254540,8259220," are like a tax credit."
8259220,8266140," I know that for some people working on the lab team, because what they're doing is directly"
8266140,8271180," involved in video production, we can be eligible for some--"
8271180,8273660," production services tax credits."
8273660,8281060," I got to be honest with you guys, we are not the best when it comes to optimizing our"
8281060,8282660," tax credits and stuff."
8282660,8288060," I don't think we've actually-- I think we've submitted but not collected, going all the"
8288060,8291420," way back to like 2018 or 2019."
8291420,8295020," I don't think we've submitted 2021 or 2022."
8295020,8296340," It's not out of laziness."
8296340,8298180," It's just extremely complicated."
8298180,8307500," I know companies downtown that are smaller than us that have employees on staff, some"
8307500,8314100," of them more than one, who their entire full-time job, they do nothing else, is to capture government"
8314100,8316100," grants."
8316100,8318660," We don't have anyone that does that."
8318660,8323460," It actually takes like a lot of time."
8323460,8325460," They make it quite the arduous process."
8325460,8326460," We've just completed--"
8326460,8328460," We've complained about this on the show before."
8328460,8334020," Because it means the people who need it most have the hardest time getting it, which is"
8334020,8335020," stupid."
8335020,8336020," Yep."
8336020,8340180," We've complained about that in regards to Cavco publicly before."
8340180,8341820," But it's true about all of it."
8341820,8342820," Like it just-- yeah."
8342820,8345500," Now, people are talking about like loopholes or avoidance."
8345500,8347180," This is not loopholes or avoidance."
8347180,8354220," This is financial aid from the government to support certain industries."
8354220,8357500," If it's there, obviously, if we're not idiots--"
8357500,8359660," You should be taking it."
8359660,8361020," We should take it, right?"
8361020,8364420," Like that's-- we're not committing fraud."
8364420,8366340," These are all things that we're eligible for."
8366340,8369180," We just need to be on top of it."
8369180,8372060," We've even been told that we're eligible for things before."
8372060,8373460," Tried to apply for it."
8373460,8377860," Ran into a massive wave of complications and just been like, \"Okay, we could get this grant"
8377860,8381940," or we could spend the time that's going to take for us to deal with all these complications.\""
8381940,8382940," Just making money."
8382940,8383940," Yes."
8383940,8388660," So every time-- almost not technically, but almost every time it's just been like, \"K,"
8388660,8390740," well, I'm just going to go back to work.\""
8390740,8391740," Yeah."
8391740,8393740," I hear that."
8393740,8394740," Yeah."
8394740,8395740," Anyway."
8395740,8397620," Yeah, go ahead."
8397620,8400020," I've got something to clarify about the desk pads."
8400020,8401020," Oh, yeah."
8401020,8403780," I'm told that they're only going to be available at LTX."
8403780,8404780," Local only."
8404780,8405780," Local only."
8405780,8406780," Wow."
8406780,8407780," All right."
8407780,8408780," Exclusive."
8408780,8409780," See you guys at LTX."
8409780,8410780," Yeah."
8410780,8416020," I told you a while ago that I was reorganizing the stuff, I was going through all of my like,"
8416020,8421260," \"I can't get rid of this article of clothing because it has significance to me stuff.\""
8421260,8425500," I found like the LTX 2017 shirt and I found like all this other kind of stuff."
8425500,8429100," One that I did get rid of, but I always felt conflicted on."
8429100,8430100," I just had too much."
8430100,8433300," I have this like massive fit at this point."
8433300,8436300," Was the berry selling shirt."
8436300,8437300," Nice."
8437300,8439740," I still had that and I was like, \"Yeah, I can get it out.\""
8439740,8442860," I think that would be a fun like float plane exclusive."
8442860,8445580," You and I compare our bins because I have a shirt bin too."
8445580,8448060," I was going to add a pencil clothing bin."
8448060,8455380," If you still have your shirt that's the way, like us sitting together in the van, that logo,"
8455380,8457820," if you still have that shirt because I found the sweater."
8457820,8458820," You have the sweater?"
8458820,8459820," I have the sweater."
8459820,8460820," No."
8460820,8464260," We should do a win where you're wearing the shirt and I'm wearing the sweater."
8464260,8465260," I'm totally down."
8465260,8466260," That'd be sick."
8466260,8468060," We should bring back the designer that we have a t-shirt printer again."
8468060,8469060," Hey, yeah."
8469060,8470300," I'd be super down."
8470300,8475100," I also have that like super old like Christmas sweater that we had, the way in Christmas"
8475100,8476100," sweater."
8476100,8477100," Oh yeah, that thing was crap."
8477100,8478100," Like all this."
8478100,8479100," Oh yeah, it is."
8479100,8480100," But yeah, I'm keeping it because it's just like..."
8480100,8486300," I've kept a lot less of like just old merch because like Nick gets mad at me if I wear"
8486300,8487300," it."
8487300,8492500," It's like, \"Yo, people can't even buy that."
8492500,8494140," What the f*** are you doing?\""
8494140,8495540," Oh, right."
8495540,8496540," Okay."
8496540,8501220," I guess it's like the front man I'm supposed to rep the stuff people can currently get,"
8501220,8505940," which is honestly fine because it's always forward and upward, right?"
8505940,8509780," We're trying to make better stuff all the time, but it's all a bit sentimental, you know?"
8509780,8510780," Stuff like that."
8510780,8511780," I don't plan on wearing it."
8511780,8517180," The 2017 shirt, I don't want to wear it because I don't want to ever wash it because"
8517180,8520420," that logo is still in really nice conditions."
8520420,8521940," So I don't want to trash it."
8521940,8526580," The mods like I've still got the mod 24 shirt."
8526580,8530500," I do too, bro."
8530500,8531860," I'm pretty sure I saved that one."
8531860,8533980," I know I found it this while I was sorting through."
8533980,8535700," I'm pretty sure it got saved."
8535700,8537100," I pulled that out in it."
8537100,8538100," Yeah, I don't know."
8538100,8541260," I was thinking when you were asking him if he was going to come to the event, I was like,"
8541260,8544460," \"Man, we were just roasting a video for not paying things.\""
8544460,8550500," But the like one of the very few times that they have, mod 24, was actually super sick."
8550500,8552740," They did not pay a lot for it."
8552740,8553740," Nope."
8553740,8561340," It was a cool event regardless."
8561340,8562340," Anywho."
8562340,8563340," Moving on."
8563340,8564340," Next one."
8564340,8565340," Okay."
8565340,8567740," This one's from Elizabeth."
8567740,8568740," Hi, Linus and Luke."
8568740,8572900," I've recently entered my first professional position where I am responsible for delegating"
8572900,8579140," to others and as leaders of your respective teams, how do you balance delegating and perfectionism?"
8580140,8589460," I knew that get it grown."
8589460,8591380," I'm getting better at it."
8591380,8597220," You have to, I mean, it's all training, right?"
8597220,8603220," You have to delegate with the assumption that everything they're going to do is wrong."
8603220,8609100," Or even if it's not wrong, it's definitely not exactly the way you would have done it."
8609100,8611660," But making the mistake could be a valuable thing."
8611660,8612660," Yeah."
8612660,8618460," And so sitting down and talking through how you feel it should have been done can have"
8618460,8620060," multiple positive effects."
8620060,8625820," It can help them to reason through it better for themselves next time."
8625820,8632540," Or conversely, it could actually open you up to new perspectives and new approaches,"
8632540,8640300," which is I think one of our biggest strengths here is that no idea is automatically stupid"
8640300,8643220," based on the position of whoever proposed it."
8643220,8647700," And that's sort of a complicated way of saying that anyone can have a valid idea for how"
8647700,8650700," we can do things better."
8650700,8661060," And so I've had to let a lot go over the years in terms of perfectionism."
8661060,8664860," I'm not going to call out anything specific."
8664860,8668580," But I watched a video recently where I kind of went in the first two minutes."
8668580,8674180," There were four obvious moments where I was like, well, it should have been the thing"
8674180,8675180," I was talking about."
8675180,8677500," There should have been an image on screen of it."
8677500,8680180," What they're supposed to imagine was the point of this even being a video."
8680180,8683220," Why don't we just upload it as an audio clip?"
8683220,8685020," Like little things like that."
8685020,8692780," Basically I can be pretty demanding, I can be pretty picky."
8692780,8697180," But the best way to move forward with that is to just have those conversations, figure"
8697180,8700620," out what the rationale was, and then figure out how to best move forward."
8700620,8706780," That's the only way you can do it."
8706780,8707780," Safe answer."
8707780,8710140," It's a good one though."
8710140,8712540," The best answer is not an answer."
8712540,8714300," Up next is from Austin."
8714300,8719580," Luke, what will you play now that Tarkhev is not an option?"
8719580,8723980," Honestly, I haven't been playing much."
8723980,8728420," I have to confess that I might have to extend the AMD challenge because I haven't touched"
8728420,8733020," my gaming computer."
8733020,8734020," Gaming is dead."
8734020,8735020," You heard it here first."
8735020,8737380," I will say it's been really busy."
8737380,8743820," Based on some of the things that have happened, that the arrests and the server seizures and"
8743820,8749020," all these massive ban waves that BSD has been doing, stuff like that, returning to Tarkhev"
8749020,8752500," might be fairly realistic fairly soon."
8752500,8758460," I was expecting it was going to be potentially ever or at least a year, but it might be a"
8758460,8760620," relatively short term thing for me to return to it."
8760620,8761620," But I've been busy, man."
8761620,8763140," I've been doing all this stuff."
8763140,8769420," There's a lot going on in my life that isn't on Wancho right now."
8769420,8770420," So I don't know."
8770420,8772820," I haven't been gaming a ton, but that's okay."
8772820,8774700," Yeah, this is great."
8774700,8777420," Back to our last one, AJ and Floatpleen Chat."
8777420,8783940," To beat my perfectionism, I just procrastinate until I don't have time to do it perfectly."
8783940,8788060," You're not supposed to say that."
8788060,8789060," Yeah."
8789060,8790060," Do you?"
8790060,8792060," Your boss and your boss's boss."
8792060,8795980," He's taking everything in my power to not say mood right now."
8795980,8796980," Damn it!"
8796980,8797980," Oh god."
8797980,8798980," I'm dead."
8798980,8799980," Please be boss."
8799980,8800980," Stop it."
8800980,8803980," We're very alike."
8803980,8805980," No."
8805980,8814620," See, the trick here is I just give AJ too much stuff, so he doesn't have..."
8814620,8816140," He has to work all the time anyways."
8816140,8817140," Oh my gosh."
8817140,8818140," Solutions solved."
8818140,8819140," I don't even want to hear that."
8819140,8823580," I don't want to hear any of this from any of you."
8823580,8828540," If you tell me to do it within the next hour and it's like a six-hour project, then you'll"
8828540,8833460," get it in an hour and a half and it'll be good and done."
8833460,8835260," That's how Luke manages."
8835260,8838900," It's been going great."
8838900,8843420," Tell him what you told me earlier about how it's been working under my team."
8843420,8850260," Oh yeah, it's very stressful."
8850260,8853620," But Luke is turning me to a confident person."
8853620,8854620," I don't know."
8854620,8856380," I scheduled a meeting."
8856380,8858500," Don't say the company, but say the story."
8858500,8860260," Yeah, I scheduled a meeting."
8860260,8862740," We needed to get this thing done."
8862740,8868340," I sent an email to the company, \"Hello, couldn't I please have a meeting with your team?\""
8868340,8871180," And they went, \"Yeah, how about Friday?\""
8871180,8875380," And then I kind of was in another meeting, freaked out and went, \"No, this has to be"
8875380,8876740," tomorrow at 11."
8876740,8879060," Answer my question instead of scheduling a meeting.\""
8879060,8881140," And then he went, \"Okay, how about tomorrow at 11?"
8881140,8882580," No, this has to be at 8.30."
8882580,8884620," We're having this meeting right now.\""
8884620,8885620," What?"
8885620,8889220," And then the meeting happened and we got it done and everything's been full steam ahead."
8889220,8894700," So it felt like a big boy man person."
8894700,8896140," No, I won't."
8896140,8898780," I won productivity, please."
8898780,8899780," Let's go."
8899780,8903220," I did a business."
8903220,8905140," Should we announce your role change?"
8905140,8907460," I don't really care."
8907460,8908460," Okay."
8908460,8916380," Luke is out as CTO or whatever the heck his role was at floatplane media, which is a lie"
8916380,8918620," because he actually retains that role."
8918620,8928580," But he's now officially back in the Linus Media Group Inc. fold as our CTO."
8928580,8938420," And he's going to be just kind of unhabhazarding things, whether it's the migration."
8938420,8947340," From last pass or some of our data resiliency practices or whether it's our documentation,"
8947340,8952820," there's things that he's gotten really good at with his team over at floatplane over the"
8952820,8953820," last five years."
8953820,8958460," And to be clear to my team over at floatplane, nothing is changing there."
8958460,8960300," He worded that really poorly."
8960300,8961660," Well, yeah, I did that on purpose."
8961660,8962660," I know."
8962660,8963660," Everything's fine."
8963660,8968300," I know for sure he's going to get at least one phone call tonight."
8968300,8971380," And no, I'm not the CTO of floatplane."
8971380,8972860," I don't think it has one."
8972860,8974700," I don't even know what you're trying to do."
8974700,8976980," The closest thing to that will probably be agent."
8976980,8977980," Yeah, COO."
8977980,8983900," So he's going to be CTO at Linus Media Group to help us take everything that's really"
8983900,8992580," good at floatplane technology wise and also do it here because no offense to some of"
8992580,8995940," the people who work on some of the tech stuff here."
8995940,9000140," No, and okay, I will actually come to their defense specifically."
9000140,9001140," Oh, I know."
9001140,9005860," In my opinion, with the time and the resources that have been given, it's been amazing what"
9005860,9006860," has been a common."
9006860,9011700," The fact that we have the kind of uptime we do genuinely is a testament to the work that"
9011700,9018460," guys like Jake and Dan and Jamie have put in to have, you know, like our security system,"
9018460,9023020," like always works, you know, big stuff works at all."
9023020,9028500," It's made of duct tape and popsicle sticks, but it actually functions."
9028500,9030460," Yeah, which is remarkable."
9030460,9031460," Really good."
9031460,9035580," The problem is that their time is also leveraged in other ways."
9035580,9038340," Everyone that's been working on it, it hasn't been their main thing."
9038340,9040220," So then they're pulled constantly."
9040220,9042420," They're pulled constantly in other directions."
9042420,9048860," And things where it's been 80, 20 ruled like on the line for a long time, 20% of the"
9048860,9050340," work, 80% of the result."
9050340,9054380," They have lived by that rule, but certain things have been left out and we're getting"
9054380,9058540," to a size, we're getting to a stage where that can't really keep happening."
9058540,9059540," We can't keep doing it."
9059540,9062860," And certain things are starting to fail, certain edge cases are starting to fail and"
9062860,9064100," they're impacting pretty hard."
9064100,9067500," So hoping to help solve that."
9067500,9072180," This does not mean that you're not going to see like infrastructure tech videos from"
9072180,9073180," Jake anymore."
9073180,9074180," Yeah, totally."
9074180,9078060," I'm landing on setting up the system so that you will see exactly as much of that."
9078060,9079060," Maybe more."
9079060,9083180," Because he should be less busy with just like random administrative nonsense."
9083180,9084820," We don't want him to do maintenance stuff."
9084820,9086900," We don't want him to do documentation."
9086900,9091260," We don't want him to do all these different things that really don't want him to do documentation."
9091260,9095180," But he should still be able to have fun and experiment with things and try things out"
9095180,9098060," and then show that on video and have that be cool for everyone."
9098060,9100500," So there will not be any less of that."
9100500,9104260," And yeah, the goal is potentially even more if he wants to do more."
9104260,9106660," So yeah, that's my stance."
9106660,9107860," Yeah, so it's exciting."
9108860,9111860," Hit me, Dan."
9111860,9112860," Okay."
9112860,9114940," Well, those I deserve it today."
9114940,9118860," Yeah, for those comments."
9118860,9119860," This one's from Mac."
9119860,9120860," I do my best."
9120860,9121860," This one's from Max."
9121860,9126860," Hey, from Guernsey, where's the weirdest place that you've seen LDT store purchases from?"
9126860,9133860," Oh, so I curated this one because I'm going to steal one, which was the figure skater."
9133860,9135540," Oh, yeah, that was awesome."
9135540,9136540," That was so sick."
9136540,9137540," Yeah."
9137540,9140140," I'm a water bottle like showed up in an Olympic broadcaster."
9140140,9141140," Yeah."
9141140,9142140," Oh, shoot."
9142140,9143140," What's his name?"
9143140,9145940," I saw him on Twitter, but I don't remember off top of my head."
9145940,9150540," I feel like I usually can, but I don't remember right now."
9150540,9151540," Nadion."
9151540,9154540," I'll find it."
9154540,9159540," I'll find it."
9159540,9161540," Hmm."
9161540,9164540," Kind of find."
9164540,9167780," Nope, I'm having a really hard time finding it."
9167780,9169220," Anyway, it was super cool."
9169220,9173220," So I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure we sent over a care package."
9173220,9174220," Yeah."
9174220,9175620," Yeah, that was that was awesome."
9175620,9179940," Just like seeing the water bottle out in the wild, like just casually supporting an elite"
9179940,9182060," athlete, you know, keeping him hydrated."
9182060,9183900," That was super cool."
9183900,9184900," All right."
9184900,9186900," Hit me with another, Dan."
9186900,9189660," I think it's like."
9189660,9190660," I'll find it."
9190660,9198660," Oh, wait."
9198660,9202100," Oh, we did this one."
9202100,9203100," Yeah, sorry."
9203100,9204100," Long time."
9204100,9205100," Watch your purchase."
9205100,9206100," Comment there."
9206100,9208100," I was thinking about bed plan."
9208100,9209100," Okay."
9209100,9210100," Me too."
9210100,9213100," What cool bed tech would you like to see?"
9213100,9216740," How do you call the brand?"
9216740,9217740," Roman Sadovski."
9217740,9220020," I thought it was Sarovski and I couldn't quite find it."
9220020,9221020," Roman Sadovski."
9221020,9222020," Sorry."
9222020,9223020," That was really rude."
9223020,9226700," What bed tech would you like to see?"
9226700,9228020," You've got a cool bed now."
9228020,9229020," Yeah."
9229020,9230020," Didn't you do it?"
9230020,9231020," I thought you were going to do it."
9231020,9232020," Yeah, I'm using it."
9232020,9234300," I don't know that I like it as much as you do."
9234300,9239900," So we're both playing around with the sleep aid or eight sleep, the eight sleep."
9239900,9247020," I kind of find that it's either like when I have it on, okay, both of us run pretty warm"
9247020,9249500," at night compared to our SOs."
9249500,9252460," And I kind of find the Oden was muted."
9252460,9253460," Okay."
9253460,9254460," I have a wear."
9254460,9255460," Basically bed tech ideas."
9255460,9256460," Yeah."
9256460,9258820," I find that it's either really warm."
9258820,9260020," Okay, how do I put this?"
9260020,9264180," I don't really like just stay on one side of the bed a lot."
9264180,9265180," What?"
9265180,9267500," I'm a cuddler."
9267500,9273100," So because Yvonne runs her side with the heater, what ends up happening is if I move"
9273100,9279020," around in the night, I'm either boiling because I'm like over the threshold to her side or"
9279020,9285180," I'm freezing because I got all sweaty on her side and I'm on my chilled side."
9285180,9286180," And I just, I don't know."
9286180,9291260," I'm actually, I'm not really liking it that much, but I also don't have the subscription."
9291260,9292860," So I, it's so, so their function."
9292860,9294180," Oh, you're going to be autopilot."
9294180,9296820," Keep you at the right temperature all the time doesn't work."
9296820,9303540," You just have to set this like super course adjustment for like a, like a, like a curve"
9303540,9306620," to be cooler in the middle of the night, apparently or something like that."
9306620,9307900," And it's not great."
9307900,9312900," I'm not, I'm not paying a subscription fee for a $3,000 mattress topper."
9312900,9314380," That's absurd."
9314380,9317140," So I just got knocked to a fan, bro."
9317140,9318140," It does."
9318140,9320940," And like, oh, that's the thing."
9320940,9322420," Maybe it, and maybe it's worth it."
9322420,9324260," Like maybe, maybe by that time, I think."
9324260,9327380," You looked into the specs of the actual computer that like runs it."
9327380,9330300," Yeah, it's like actually surprisingly like, oh, wow."
9330300,9332060," Yeah, but I already bought the computer."
9332060,9333060," Yeah."
9333060,9334060," I just, I find it so offensive."
9334060,9335060," No, I hear you."
9335060,9340260," But like, okay, it's not like there aren't subscription services that I do pay for."
9340260,9344780," I pay for like a Nabukasa, the home, the home assistant cloud subscription."
9344780,9345780," Oh, yeah."
9345780,9347140," And it's not even the only way to do that."
9347140,9350820," You can work around it with your own thing, but it's just, it's way more convenient."
9350820,9353020," It's like $5 a month or something like that."
9353020,9358260," And honestly, for the bed, maybe I, maybe I just should because it would be more comfortable"
9358260,9359260," or whatever."
9359260,9361140," But like, I mean, you've been pretty happy with it."
9361140,9363900," I've had, I've had a good experience."
9363900,9368260," I find AC off is now like tolerable."
9368260,9375900," It doesn't completely solve it for me because even with, so it's minimum possible temperature"
9375900,9378260," is, is negative 10 degrees."
9378260,9381260," Is it actually running at that?"
9381260,9387900," I don't think so, but it feels pretty cold, but I am a big boy and I am running very hot."
9387900,9392420," So it'll, it'll get into a situation where like my, if I'm laying on my back, my like"
9392420,9396060," back will be a nice temperature, but my like chest is roasting."
9396060,9397060," Yes."
9397060,9399940," Because it's not enough to like get all the way through me."
9399940,9402180," So you need a cooled blanket too."
9402180,9403180," I need a cooled like."
9403180,9405780," Which would be inherently weighted and weighted blankets are apparently."
9405780,9407780," Oh, you need a cooled weighted."
9407780,9410180," My favorite store.com next project."
9410180,9411180," Kyle, are you watching?"
9411180,9412180," Let's go."
9412180,9417860," The thing right now that has made it so I get just like actually amazing sleeps is when"
9417860,9424140," it's so hot that we need to turn the AC on and then I can bundle a bit and take like"
9424140,9428660," instead of the thinnest blanket I've ever found on the market, which is what I normally"
9428660,9433140," sleep with, I can actually have like a thicker blanket on and I have the eight sleep at the"
9433140,9438540," lowest temperature it can possibly go and the AC on that I'm like, Oh, wow, I am, I am"
9438540,9439940," a cozy boy."
9439940,9443620," And then I sleep super, super well and I feel very rejuvenated in the morning."
9443620,9444620," It is."
9444620,9451180," It isn't quite enough just on its own, but it helps it."
9451180,9455340," So it's way better with it for me."
9455340,9460020," Yeah, but it's not a hundred percent of what I could hope for if that makes sense."
9460020,9461020," But I still like it."
9461020,9463380," I wouldn't recommend it for everyone because it's really expensive."
9463380,9467420," It's really expensive, but like it does help me."
9467420,9469100," Yeah, and other stuff."
9469100,9471340," I don't know if anything could magically cure my insomnia."
9471340,9472340," I'd be down for that."
9472340,9476300," I don't need another device to tell me you had a terrible sleep last night."
9476300,9478020," It's like, yeah, thanks."
9478020,9479020," Yep."
9479020,9480420," All right, what's next?"
9480420,9481420," Yep."
9481420,9482980," All right, let's have a look."
9482980,9487740," Oh my goodness, the merch messages are coming in too fast for poor Dan to read them to us"
9487740,9490260," and also curate and reply to them."
9490260,9491260," Yeah, sorry."
9491260,9494060," I'm not ready for, for, for, I'm doing other things."
9494060,9496020," This one's from Maxwell."
9496020,9500940," Hey, Luke, a couple of wands ago, you mentioned a viewer in Antarctica."
9500940,9503140," Sorry, that was me."
9503140,9506180," I work in McMurdo, a US station."
9506180,9510060," I was wondering what you guys had to do to make the surface work better."
9510060,9513300," 100% honestly, I don't remember, but I'm pretty sure AJ's watching."
9513300,9514620," Yeah, AJ's in the chat."
9514620,9518820," So maybe AJ remembers because I'm pretty sure that AJ did it and Luke just supervised."
9518820,9519820," Probably."
9519820,9521380," That was a long time ago."
9521380,9524820," So that was when AJ was doing literally all of our infrastructure."
9524820,9529940," So yeah, I mean, he did that for a long time."
9529940,9536180," Look, I was trying to make us sound like a real company, Luke."
9536180,9539180," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
9539180,9543340," So maybe, maybe AJ will get back to us in the float plane chat or maybe AJ doesn't have"
9543340,9545460," to be working right now because it's late, but whatever."
9545460,9547340," Yeah, I don't know 100% know that he's still around."
9547340,9548940," I just think he is."
9548940,9551220," Okay, just wouldn't surprise me."
9551220,9555100," Next up is from Kyle with Ring being on the outs."
9555100,9558460," What is your recommendations for home security and surveillance?"
9558460,9563500," I'm really happy with my ubiquity stuff."
9563500,9568340," It's tough though because obviously it's easy for me to say when ubiquity is a long time"
9568340,9572660," collaborator of ours and sends us a lot of the stuff that we need from them."
9572660,9576180," It's really expensive, especially for home use."
9576180,9577980," So it's tough, right?"
9577980,9581620," There was that man, what was that wise?"
9581620,9585180," There was that cheap brand that everyone loved for a while and then they started locking"
9585180,9586180," things down."
9586180,9587900," So it like apparently sucks now."
9587900,9590500," I haven't completely looked into it."
9590500,9594180," We did a video on like a DIY solution back in the day."
9594180,9601420," Jake did something up and it was like a pie zero, like DIY security camera thing, something"
9601420,9604460," like that could obviously work."
9604460,9610260," There's, yeah, there, I don't know, maybe this is something that we just need to really"
9610260,9613140," dig into and do a video."
9613140,9618500," I know I'm off topic, but I am just so happy that Antarctica guys still subscribed."
9618500,9619860," It's actually so sick."
9619860,9622260," Well, you don't actually know that."
9622260,9623260," That's fair."
9623260,9626020," Antarctica guy is not actually in the float plane chat."
9626020,9627020," That was a merge message."
9627020,9628020," She has."
9628020,9630100," So maybe they're still around in some way."
9630100,9631100," Okay."
9631100,9636060," AJ says we had a VM with a specific host at the time where we did pretty much all our"
9636060,9637060," CDN things."
9637060,9640340," Okay, that's a really vague, posty explanation."
9640340,9642140," Thank you for that, AJ."
9642140,9645420," It was a server."
9645420,9650420," Probably we just put an edge node closer on a route that was good for getting there."
9650420,9651420," Probably."
9651420,9654540," Thanks, Captain, probably."
9654540,9658900," I asked Captain actually knows I'm sorry it's late."
9658900,9659900," That's fair."
9659900,9660900," Go."
9660900,9661900," Yeah, it's what it."
9661900,9662900," Go, go to bed."
9662900,9663900," Oh, exactly that."
9663900,9664900," Yeah."
9664900,9665900," Okay."
9665900,9666900," Yeah."
9666900,9667900," So it's what I said."
9667900,9671300," I was like 99% sure from the beginning, but I didn't know 100% because it's been a bajillion"
9671300,9672300," years."
9672300,9674900," So we're not shipping anything to Antarctica, Jayden."
9674900,9678100," All right, Dan, hit me."
9678100,9680820," Speaking of shipping, this one's from Cody."
9680820,9685700," What type of food would you sell on LDT store if shipping food internationally wasn't a terrible"
9685700,9686700," idea?"
9686700,9689060," CBD gummies."
9689060,9690060," There's great margin."
9690060,9691380," Is there a problem?"
9691380,9697140," Yeah, I actually had a former colleague from NCIX who wanted to start up like a partnership"
9697140,9701820," like doing like alertness, gamer, CBD gummies and stuff like that."
9701820,9703180," They sent me over some of the products."
9703180,9705020," It actually seemed really good."
9705020,9706140," I actually really liked it."
9706140,9708380," The sleep one was not bad."
9708380,9709380," Not a perfect solution."
9709380,9713900," I still do struggle to sleep sometimes, but definitely better than nothing, which is about"
9713900,9716860," all you can really ask for when it comes to supplements and stuff."
9716860,9720940," I don't know if there's just like a lot of margin in it or what's going on, but it seems"
9720940,9727180," like every single fitness influencer person sells their own protein powder."
9727180,9728180," Yeah, good margin."
9728180,9729180," That's it."
9729180,9730180," It's got to be what's going on."
9730180,9731180," It's like nothing."
9731180,9733620," It's what like ground up snail shells or whatever, right?"
9733620,9734620," It's worthless."
9734620,9735620," It's way, yeah."
9735620,9736620," It's just way."
9736620,9737620," Yeah."
9737620,9738620," I know."
9738620,9739620," I know."
9739620,9742300," I thought you were legitimately correcting me because you thought I thought that it was"
9742300,9744300," actually made of that."
9744300,9746140," I love how you pour it into milk."
9746140,9752100," You're just pouring a part of milk into more actual milk than you drink."
9752100,9753100," Yeah, so."
9753100,9756300," You're drinking hyper milk."
9756300,9757940," More milk per milk."
9757940,9758940," Yeah."
9758940,9761940," That's basically what's happening or energy powder."
9761940,9762940," Yeah."
9762940,9767780," They all have their own pre-workout creatine, protein powder, whatever."
9767780,9770140," They all have their own range of supplement stuff."
9770140,9774620," It's because you can just find an OEM that makes it just slap a label on it."
9774620,9775620," It's the simplest thing ever."
9775620,9780540," He had a relationship that he was forging with a big manufacturer of CBD gummies."
9780540,9782340," He was like, \"Go for it."
9782340,9784740," If it's good enough for Martha Stewart, it's good enough for you.\""
9784740,9787460," You probably, based on what I just said, probably know who this was."
9787460,9789380," I knew it was from the beginning of the process."
9789380,9790380," Oh, okay."
9790380,9791380," Fair enough."
9791380,9793900," My hesitations were twofold."
9793900,9801540," One was I had a lot of concern about even if I don't give a rat's petuit about CBD or"
9801540,9803780," weed or whatever."
9803780,9806540," There's a lot of uptight people out there."
9806540,9812900," It's one of those spaces that as a loosely regulated industry, there's just a lot of"
9812900,9814900," crap going on."
9814900,9818740," A lot of shady stuff, a lot of shady people are involved."
9818740,9821060," I don't need the association."
9821060,9829260," Number two is I've always been extremely hesitant about anything that people ingest."
9829260,9833740," I thought, frankly speaking, I thought Mr. Beast was absolutely busy."
9833740,9834740," Bad **** crazy."
9834740,9835740," Beast Burger."
9835740,9836740," Beast Burger."
9836740,9837740," Yeah."
9837740,9838740," And then he did the hard stuff too."
9838740,9841900," These random, well, the chocolate one, I don't even mind as much because at least it's"
9841900,9846420," coming from presumably some kind of factory that actually has some kind of actual safety"
9846420,9847420," protocols."
9847420,9848420," But all these random ghost kitchens."
9848420,9852940," But all these random ghost kitchens with Lord Only Knows how long these things are sitting"
9852940,9855140," on a warmer before they get delivered."
9855140,9856540," I don't know."
9856540,9858740," I promise you, he doesn't know."
9858740,9862900," It only takes as far, depending on how your company is set up, it only takes one person"
9862900,9867100," to like **** die for the whole thing to come crumbling down."
9867100,9874460," So anything that people ingest, I've just been very sketched out by it."
9874460,9881700," Possible will do like gamer snacks or something at some point, but it just hasn't happened."
9881700,9882700," Yeah."
9882700,9883700," Okay."
9883700,9891780," I've got another one here from Joshua Linus has your wife vetoed any ideas or purchases"
9891780,9893380," you still want to make?"
9893380,9899180," If so, what were they?"
9899180,9901180," She's pretty permissive as well."
9901180,9903100," I was going to say, doesn't really do that that much."
9903100,9904100," Yeah."
9904100,9906020," Like we had this, we had a concept a while back where we were going to buy like."
9906020,9907020," She'll be very disappointed."
9907020,9908020," Yeah."
9908020,9910580," We were going to buy a sex doll for like a channel super fun or something."
9910580,9912740," It's like $12,000 or something like that."
9912740,9915380," Well, yeah, that's why we didn't do it because we found out the price."
9915380,9916380," Oh, okay."
9916380,9917380," But she wasn't the obstacle."
9917380,9920220," Like she's, yeah, she's pretty chill."
9920220,9923900," Like she's, okay, what's great about Yvonne is that she."
9923900,9925540," She lets you buy sex dolls."
9925540,9927460," I mean, it's pretty reasonably priced."
9927460,9930340," That price, they're very realistic."
9930340,9932340," So I've heard."
9932340,9933340," Yeah."
9933340,9937780," So she's a great."
9937780,9939780," Yeah."
9939780,9940780," Yeah."
9940780,9941780," Yeah."
9941780,9947700," She will try to talk you down off of the branch, but if you insist on climbing more or jumping"
9947700,9951140," or swinging from it or doing whatever stupid thing it is, they try to help you do it the"
9951140,9952140," best way."
9952140,9954140," So try and make sure you don't get hurt, right?"
9954140,9955140," Yeah."
9955140,9957140," That's her, that's her thing."
9957140,9958140," Yeah."
9958140,9963580," So I can't think of anything that she's really vetoed."
9963580,9965060," I think she could go back in time."
9965060,9969060," She would veto the smart light switches, but other than that, we don't disagree about"
9969060,9970060," that much."
9970060,9971060," Yeah."
9971060,9972700," All right, hit me."
9972700,9973700," Okay."
9973700,9974860," Next one's up from Michael."
9974860,9979180," My friends and I use the dollar per hour ratio to judge game value."
9979180,9984340," You've both spoken about how you don't care for MTX or cosmetics."
9984340,9992540," One of our group has spent $2,400 in Fortnite, but with 5,000 hours."
9992540,9993620," Thoughts."
9993620,9996180," I have lots of thoughts."
9996180,10000780," 5,000 hours in Fortnite."
10000780,10003980," Yeah, that was what I mean first."
10003980,10006700," Is that in game or does that include menus?"
10006700,10009700," I mean, it would include menus probably."
10009700,10010700," Some games don't."
10010700,10011700," Oh, okay."
10011700,10015860," Most games do, but this isn't like a steam-tracked game, right?"
10015860,10016860," Steam counts menus."
10016860,10019860," I know that."
10019860,10020860," Yeah."
10020860,10021860," Woof."
10021860,10030940," That's a lot of hours in Fortnite."
10030940,10034100," We're still on that."
10034100,10037660," That's also, there's a lot of money."
10037660,10039260," You didn't have to spend that money."
10039260,10046100," You could have also gotten 5,000 hours in Fortnite and not spent that money."
10046100,10050660," And then the dollar per hour ratio would be even lower, which would be even better."
10050660,10054180," I am down with supporting things that you use a lot."
10054180,10057260," Like I remember I got rocket, I've told this on the show before."
10057260,10061140," I got rocket league on some crazy sale for like three bucks or something, and then I've"
10061140,10062820," just played the heck out of it."
10062820,10064820," So I bought a couple seasons passes or something."
10064820,10065820," Yeah."
10065820,10068300," I'm sure my total in on that."
10068300,10069340," Not that much."
10069340,10070340," Probably like less than 50 bucks."
10070340,10071340," Okay."
10071340,10072340," And I played a ton of it."
10072340,10073780," Let's talk about World of Warcraft."
10073780,10074780," Okay."
10074780,10081020," You've probably spent more than $2400 on Wow."
10081020,10083780," It was like 50 bucks a month back in the day."
10083780,10087100," It was like, oh no, it was 50 bucks to buy the thing."
10087100,10088100," Okay."
10088100,10089700," With all the expansions though, are you sure?"
10089700,10090700," It's 15."
10090700,10091700," 15 a month."
10091700,10092700," Okay."
10092700,10095940," So that's almost $200 a year."
10095940,10098580," I bet you're close to 5,000."
10098580,10100380," No, no, 2.4."
10100380,10101380," Oh."
10101380,10102380," 15 times."
10102380,10105580," Let's say that."
10105580,10109500," Let he who is without sin cast the first stone here, sir."
10109500,10112180," I promise you, I have never spent $2,000 on a."
10112180,10113180," Oh, wait, hold on."
10113180,10114180," How much did I spend on star since?"
10114180,10116180," No, I have never spent $2,000 on a video."
10116180,10117180," I'm committing to though."
10117180,10118180," Yeah."
10118180,10121020," If it actually ever comes out, you're going to have a big bill."
10121020,10123460," Okay, that's true."
10123460,10125260," Fresh ship that is hopefully good."
10125260,10126260," Who knows?"
10126260,10127860," Yeah, I guess we'll see."
10127860,10133860," Okay, but one of the things, my brother and I shared an account for like literally the"
10133860,10136260," majority of the time that I played the game."
10136260,10137260," Okay."
10137260,10140060," And then another significant portion of me playing the game was definitely private servers,"
10140060,10141500," which you don't pay for monthly."
10141500,10143980," I see."
10143980,10146940," I just think I think you're not that far off probably."
10146940,10148860," 15 times 12 is 180."
10148860,10149860," Yeah."
10149860,10152020," So let's say I played for four years."
10152020,10153020," Is that it?"
10153020,10154020," I don't know."
10154020,10155020," Because I played."
10155020,10156020," I was like, well, you played for a long time."
10156020,10157020," Classic."
10157020,10158020," Yeah."
10158020,10160740," I played like three quarters of, I never played consistently."
10160740,10162460," I played three quarters of classic."
10162460,10165700," I played like half to three quarters of burnout crusade."
10165700,10167580," I played one quarter of wrath."
10167580,10168580," Okay."
10168580,10171660," And then I never played consistently again until Classic came out again."
10171660,10177580," But I am pretty sure I got like almost every expansion, but I never, I very rarely got"
10177580,10178580," them right away."
10178580,10182780," I would get them when they were like basically free right before the next one came out."
10182780,10184500," Sure."
10184500,10187100," We get it."
10187100,10188100," Your cheapskate."
10188100,10189100," Yeah."
10189100,10191260," But my point stands when you compare."
10191260,10192260," I've spent a bunch on games."
10192260,10193260," Yeah."
10193260,10201180," When you compare this ratio to something like, oh wow, does it actually seem that outlandish?"
10201180,10202180," I don't know."
10202180,10204900," I think it depends how much you play each month."
10204900,10206400," Subscription model game."
10206400,10209580," Does it need to be a subscription model game for the amount of content you get versus the"
10209580,10212260," content cycling that Fortnite does go through?"
10212260,10214940," Yeah, they do innovate a lot."
10214940,10216340," They do big map changes."
10216340,10220620," They do things like, I mean, I'm not necessarily interested in it, but you can turn into like"
10220620,10221620," the Hulk or something."
10221620,10222620," I don't remember."
10222620,10223620," Yeah, I don't know who cares."
10223620,10224620," Yeah."
10224620,10225620," You can turn into like Ariana Grande, I think."
10225620,10226620," Sure."
10226620,10227620," Yeah."
10227620,10228620," I have no idea."
10228620,10230620," So yeah, I don't know."
10230620,10239860," It doesn't seem right to me."
10239860,10241380," Okay."
10241380,10245260," But if the math's there and they're fulfilled, like, I don't really care what they do with"
10245260,10246580," their own personal money."
10246580,10248820," You do whatever you want."
10248820,10250740," All right."
10250740,10251740," Okay."
10251740,10254020," All right, Dan hit us."
10254020,10255020," Okay."
10255020,10257660," Next up is from Christopher."
10257660,10260900," One last question, what is the goal of right to repair?"
10260900,10266620," I have been buying replacement parts and repairing my electronics since I broke an iPhone, iPhone"
10266620,10268980," 3G ages ago."
10268980,10272180," Have I not had the right to repair?"
10272180,10274300," I don't really understand your question."
10274300,10275300," What?"
10275300,10284900," The goal of right to repair is that the ability to repair your device is a right and more"
10284900,10293860," so that your ability to do that, your right to repair it cannot be impeded by other parties."
10293860,10298980," So the fact that you have been able to get replacement parts for your electronics since"
10298980,10306420," you broke your iPhone 3G ages ago is not for their lack of trying to make those replacement"
10306420,10310220," parts impossible or inordinately expensive to get."
10310220,10314940," You've been lucky and you should be thankful to the right to repair advocates and crusaders"
10314940,10321480," that are out there pushing for this because without them, no, companies like Apple would"
10321480,10325460," absolutely restrict your ability to get any of that stuff."
10325460,10329300," They would want you to come to them for first party repairs or they would want to sell you"
10329300,10330540," a new device."
10330540,10336540," So right to repair is what you're talking about, except it is establishing it as a right."
10336540,10340820," It's establishing that you actually have ownership of the things that you have bought and that"
10340820,10346780," they are no, not in fact still the property of the company that produced them."
10346780,10357060," If you do not, if you do not sort of, if right to repair is not a priority for you or you"
10357060,10361620," don't think that it's important, you do not understand it."
10361620,10364780," It really is very black and white."
10364780,10370340," There's not any room for negotiation or nuance on this."
10370340,10380660," The solutions for how we enforce the consumer's right to repair, well that's where there's"
10380660,10388340," room for discussion, but the actual right to repair, to own devices that you pay for,"
10388340,10393260," that's not negotiable and if you disagree then you're just wrong unfortunately and you"
10393260,10400860," need to educate yourself because the people who do disagree will put up all kinds of just"
10400860,10406140," frankly ridiculous arguments like, well what if I don't want to, what if I want apple to"
10406140,10409580," repair, then by all means go do it."
10409580,10415420," The right for someone else to repair a device themselves does not infringe upon your right"
10415420,10419660," to pay someone too much money for them to do it or even a reasonable amount of money for"
10419660,10420660," them to do it."
10420660,10423820," Everyone has different priorities, not everybody wants to tinker with their stupid phone, I"
10423820,10431140," get it, but just because you don't means you need to sit down, shut your mouth and let"
10431140,10434460," everyone else do their thing, that's all."
10434460,10436460," Very simple."
10436460,10443100," All right, okay, up next we have Kyler."
10443100,10447700," Over the years we've seen tech have the infamous planned obsolescence."
10447700,10456340," What tech equipment would you say has no excuse to be going bad and only a handful of years?"
10456340,10461860," I'm really tired of phones, just like turning into complete suck."
10461860,10465860," I mean I'm pretty sure that my dad when I was growing up had had his rotary phone for"
10465860,10467260," like 20 years."
10467260,10472100," I mean it was like yellowed enough, like the plastics were, but it still worked."
10472100,10473380," But yeah, but everything still worked."
10473380,10476980," I mean yeah, it's, I hate the disposability of these things."
10476980,10481460," I think about this when I get rid of certain things actually, because if there's like a"
10481460,10486180," new shiny thing on the market that I want and I'm replacing something that I have, yes,"
10486180,10489020," everyone's going to call me cheap."
10489020,10493540," I think about like the amount of issues that I might have with it, with the new thing, as"
10493540,10497420," it gets into its obsolescent period, its planned obsolescent period."
10497420,10503340," And I'm like, the thing that I have right now works, do I want to just keep that?"
10503340,10504340," Maybe."
10504340,10505340," Depends."
10505340,10506340," Depends on the thing."
10506340,10508340," Depends on how impacted it is."
10508340,10511820," Phones, it gets a little bit too painful."
10511820,10513620," You kind of got to move on."
10513620,10514620," Batteries aren't replaceable."
10514620,10517900," Your battery running out of total capacity gets really, really frustrating."
10517900,10518900," Yeah."
10518900,10519900," Certain apps aren't going to work as well."
10519900,10521220," You run out of software updates, stuff like that."
10521220,10522420," You kind of got to do it in a certain degree."
10522420,10524220," I've been running on this one for a while."
10524220,10527100," It's still fine right now, but it'll run out of its."
10527100,10530260," I'm going to go with earphones."
10530260,10536260," Audio devices are something that for decades we've been able to count on to be pretty decent"
10536260,10540220," 10 years after you bought them, as long as you invested in a good one, like a good quality"
10540220,10541220," one."
10541220,10545180," Whereas now you buy a pair of earphones with the expectation that in three to five years"
10545180,10546180," it will be actual e-ways."
10546180,10550660," Do you think that's why the headphone jack went away to make earphones a consumable?"
10550660,10556180," I like to not wear my tinfoil hat."
10556180,10562860," So loud and proud as all that, but I mean, I don't know."
10562860,10570540," Sometimes I can't tell the difference between 4D chess and just design first."
10570540,10572300," Like I just, I don't know."
10572300,10574780," I don't know, but I don't know."
10574780,10575780," Maybe."
10575780,10581100," I mean, maybe buds, but like the kinds of headphones we're wearing now, you know, some"
10581100,10582100," of those do last for decades."
10582100,10583460," You're still doing that pretty well."
10583460,10586420," Oh yeah, these do, which is like, yeah, but that's the precedent for it, right?"
10586420,10589180," Like I expect, I mean, these are not maybe not these ones."
10589180,10590180," Yeah, not these ones."
10590180,10593340," They're just my 595s."
10593340,10597860," I'm on, I don't even know how many times I've replaced the earpads, but I just keep replacing"
10597860,10598860," the earpads."
10598860,10599860," They're fantastic headphones."
10599860,10601180," I hope I never have to stop using them."
10601180,10604420," I'm on year 15 with mine and I haven't even replaced the earpads."
10604420,10606180," They're like, still going strong."
10606180,10607180," Oh, yeah."
10607180,10608180," Oh."
10608180,10609180," Okay."
10609180,10611340," Next big, they're leather, whatever."
10611340,10612340," Okay."
10612340,10613340," Yeah, that's fine."
10613340,10614340," I thought you had 595s."
10614340,10615340," No, no."
10615340,10616340," Mine."
10616340,10617340," And I was like, that's gross."
10617340,10618340," Sorry."
10618340,10619340," Oh, good God."
10619340,10620340," Okay."
10620340,10622420," Next down, we've got Alex."
10622420,10625580," Have you ever thought about getting into frequencies?"
10625580,10626580," Yes."
10626580,10628860," I want to re-experience that new PC."
10628860,10629820," We have a smell."
10629820,10633540," I want a magic blue smoke fragrance."
10633540,10635020," Oh, God, no."
10635020,10638140," That gives me so much anxiety."
10638140,10643300," If you could just dab a little bit of magic blue smoke on the wrist, man, just, ah."
10643300,10644300," Take a good closer."
10644300,10645300," A new electronics."
10645300,10647220," I'd love a new electronics fragrance."
10647220,10648820," I don't want to smell any of these things."
10648820,10649820," Plastic."
10649820,10650820," Yeah."
10650820,10651820," Oh, burr, plastic."
10651820,10653980," Ah, I love it."
10653980,10654980," Gross."
10654980,10655980," Okay."
10655980,10656980," Okay."
10656980,10658900," Last of the curated, this is from Antoine."
10658900,10660260," What would be, sorry, one second."
10660260,10666620," What would be funny is if for April Fool's events for LTT Store, if you guys actually"
10666620,10672100," made joke products, but you actually made them and actually shipped them to people?"
10672100,10677340," Luke, why do you enable him?"
10677340,10679060," Because it's awesome."
10679060,10682860," Sometimes they'll follow through with stuff that I think is hilarious and it's great."
10682860,10685020," I'm not telling you to nod."
10685020,10690020," Because I was thinking the other day about, I haven't heard about cards against humanity"
10690020,10693780," in a long time, but they used to do stuff like that."
10693780,10696940," They would basically troll their customers, but they would be transparent about it."
10696940,10698220," They'd be like, \"You're buying this thing.\""
10698220,10700220," And people would be like, \"No way."
10700220,10702020," There's no way they'd ship that to me.\""
10702020,10704020," And then they actually do it."
10704020,10705020," I just, I like that."
10705020,10707100," I mean, do you grant those sort of things too?"
10707100,10708100," Yeah."
10708100,10709700," It's not unheard of."
10709700,10711260," It is definitely actually a thing."
10711260,10714780," It's a lot of work developing a product that's actually good."
10714780,10717100," I don't like manufacturing garbage."
10717100,10719900," I don't like manufactured waste."
10719900,10729820," So I have tended away from anything that's just LOL."
10729820,10731260," That's what I will say about that."
10731260,10732260," That's fair."
10732260,10733260," Yeah, that is fair."
10733260,10734260," Okay."
10734260,10736300," Last of the curated from Antoine."
10736300,10742100," I've been watching the weekly news analysis, Open Parentheses, LOL, Close Parentheses,"
10742100,10744740," show religiously for about six to seven years now."
10744740,10750580," How do you guys deal with crazy people who know you as I do without having met you?"
10750580,10752260," I think we're just kind of used to it."
10752260,10753260," Yeah, it's not that bad."
10753260,10754260," Yeah."
10754260,10755260," I mean, it's like-"
10755260,10758620," There's been times where it was bad, but they're usually very contained and you get"
10758620,10759620," over it."
10759620,10761100," Yeah, it's overall pretty cool."
10761100,10762100," Yeah."
10762100,10771580," It's always a nice- I always liked the status flex, like back when I was in dating phases."
10771580,10775820," If you're out on the date with someone and someone comes up to you and like, \"Oh, it's"
10775820,10776820," great.\""
10776820,10780740," I would always like- I would notice someone looking at me and be like that person knows"
10780740,10781740," who I am."
10781740,10782740," Sometimes-"
10782740,10783740," And I'd be like, \"Come on.\""
10783740,10784740," But is it effective?"
10784740,10785740," Yeah."
10785740,10789060," Not as effective as chicken apparently."
10789060,10790860," Hey, they're both effective."
10790860,10791860," Okay."
10791860,10792860," I'm with both of them."
10792860,10793860," Yeah."
10793860,10794860," Okay."
10794860,10795860," You don't hit anyone with chicken."
10795860,10796860," Okay."
10796860,10797860," That's not okay, Dan."
10797860,10798860," You get salmonella."
10798860,10800860," No, chicken-ella."
10800860,10802860," I said chicken, not salmon."
10802860,10803860," Yeah."
10803860,10804860," Yeah."
10804860,10806860," I'm so bad at this."
10806860,10807860," Sorry."
10807860,10808860," Okay."
10808860,10809860," Last curated."
10809860,10810860," Oh, no, that was it."
10810860,10811860," Yeah, that was the curate."
10811860,10812860," Then we're on to the potentials."
10812860,10813860," No."
10813860,10816500," Do you want me to read the potentials and you can keep working on incoming?"
10816500,10817500," Should we just go for it?"
10817500,10818500," Yeah."
10818500,10821540," This freaks asks, \"Lionis, can you sell things that are already waste?\""
10821540,10824980," For example, the high school I went to demolished a couple of years ago, they were selling bricks"
10824980,10825980," to alumni."
10825980,10832700," Yeah, that's something we actually do want to do more of, is turning e-waste into decorative"
10832700,10833700," items."
10833700,10838140," It's been over a year, which is sort of embarrassing, but we've wanted to do--"
10838140,10839780," You could do the exploding boxes."
10839780,10840780," Yeah, we could."
10840780,10841780," Those are a lot of work."
10841780,10847500," We're trying to figure out things that are relatively scalable because unless you're actually"
10847500,10853660," repurposing many pounds of electronics, are you doing anything?"
10853660,10854660," I don't know."
10854660,10856940," It's all just delaying the inevitable, and I understand that."
10856940,10860420," We're looking for things that are reasonably scalable."
10860420,10868780," One of the ideas we had is like acrylic or resin coasters with CPUs embedded in them."
10868780,10873820," That's something we've been trying to perfect for over a year."
10873820,10876220," Not full time, obviously."
10876220,10877580," It's been on the table."
10877580,10883940," It's a project that's been kind of handed off first from, I think, who was the first"
10883940,10884940," person to touch it?"
10884940,10888500," I think Kyle might have done something with it, and then Tynan was on it."
10888500,10893340," Then I think one of the new engineers who might still be on probation was on it."
10893340,10895940," Jacob might have looked at it at some point when he was here."
10895940,10899940," The point is, a lot of people have kind of chipped away at it, but we haven't figured"
10899940,10905660," out exactly how to make sure the bottom doesn't end up concave."
10905660,10909860," We haven't figured out how to make sure that whatever the acrylic that we machine out the"
10909860,10915660," spot for is exactly the same tone and fades in exactly the same way as the resin that we"
10915660,10918220," put in it, getting all the bubbles out of the resin."
10918220,10924020," There's actually a lot involved in just the stupidest bullsh*t sometimes."
10924020,10925020," It seems easy."
10925020,10930900," Yeah, I just put a CPU in resin, but what if the CPU goes too deep into the resin and"
10930900,10932220," it pokes through the top?"
10932220,10934220," Well, that doesn't look very nice."
10934220,10936900," Well, okay, you could put a thing in there to keep it from going down to deep."
10936900,10938780," How do they used to do the old school keychains?"
10938780,10939780," I don't know."
10939780,10941740," Was that resin or was that like a plastic case?"
10941740,10942740," I'm not sure."
10942740,10943740," I don't remember."
10943740,10944740," It's a good question."
10944740,10945740," So we'll figure it out."
10945740,10950620," It just takes time."
10950620,10952300," You guys are on it now for the potentials?"
10952300,10953300," Oh, yeah, sure."
10953300,10955140," They're just going to go in through them."
10955140,10957540," Okay, I can do potentials."
10957540,10962260," Samuel says, \"Hopefully this jacket is worth $250."
10962260,10965140," My question is, do you guys have any thoughts on hydrogen fuel cell?\""
10965140,10968020," I would love to see hydrogen fuel cell succeed."
10968020,10973900," From what I can tell, it's far less impactful in terms of mining rare earth metals than"
10973900,10975420," what we're doing right now."
10975420,10982820," With that said, Tesla did show off some very promising slides at their last tech day to"
10982820,10990820," do with reducing the, I believe it was nickel and cobalt, contents of their battery."
10990820,10992300," So who knows?"
10992300,10999300," If batteries get less reliant on heavy metals, if batteries get more recyclable, like if we"
10999300,11005060," could take a dead lithium battery and get back 80, 90 plus percent of the lithium and"
11005060,11008940," turn it back into a working battery, I'd love to see that."
11008940,11017180," But otherwise, hydrogen fuel cell, aside from just being kind of stalled right now in terms"
11017180,11019740," of at least what I'm seeing as a general consumer."
11019740,11025380," It's not an industry that I follow super closely."
11025380,11027620," I'd love for it to work there."
11027620,11028620," That's what I'll say about it."
11028620,11034540," I just, there's so much momentum for electric charging now and so little momentum for hydrogen"
11034540,11036180," fuel cell fueling stations."
11036180,11040060," I just, I don't have a lot of hope."
11040060,11041060," Yeah."
11041060,11042060," Yep."
11042060,11049220," All right, I'm supposed to be doing this."
11049220,11055860," At Linus, seeing as you seemed to enjoy playing Horizon Call of the Mountain on PSVR 2, do you"
11055860,11058300," think you might give Horizon Zero Dawn another try?"
11058300,11059740," I finished Horizon Zero Dawn."
11059740,11060740," Yeah."
11060740,11061740," Yeah, I loved Horizon Zero Dawn."
11061740,11062740," Yeah, it's a great game."
11062740,11063740," Yeah, it's a really good game."
11063740,11066220," If you haven't played it, it's awesome."
11066220,11070140," I played through it on the, on the Steam Deck."
11070140,11074500," The only issue I had was related to running it on the Steam Deck and it being in its very"
11074500,11078700," early days and some sort of weird crashing and bugginess and stuff like that."
11078700,11079940," I don't know, a really great game."
11079940,11083220," Really enjoyed it."
11083220,11086700," Currently watching March 3rd WAN Show, High Future Me."
11086700,11088420," Oh, you can shoot behind."
11088420,11089420," I see."
11089420,11095580," Linus and Luke and Dan, what has been your favorite date with your respective Essos?"
11095580,11099340," Why and do you think they would pick the same?"
11099340,11100780," If you guys aren't ready, I can go first."
11100780,11105140," I have something in mind, but okay."
11105140,11110820," I did the most fun date that Yvonne and I went on, at least in the last five years,"
11110820,11117060," was we did something called a Discovery Flight at a flight school at the local airfield."
11117060,11119260," It was shockingly affordable."
11119260,11120460," Did you guys ever do it?"
11120460,11121460," No."
11121460,11122460," Do it."
11122460,11123460," Wait, spoil that."
11123460,11125940," It's not like Emma watches the WAN Show."
11125940,11128700," Yes, she does."
11128700,11129620," Oh."
11129620,11131700," You know what?"
11131700,11133780," No, I'm not accepting any responsibility for this."
11133780,11135980," I told him like a year ago."
11135980,11136980," There."
11136980,11139580," Yeah, because it was my idea, because I asked you to go."
11139580,11140580," Was it?"
11140580,11141580," Yeah."
11141580,11142580," No."
11142580,11144580," And then you just did it without me."
11144580,11146980," Okay, I guess we're airing some dirty laundry today."
11146980,11151380," Well, it was a really good idea."
11151380,11152780," So it's shockingly affordable."
11152780,11155780," It was like $130 or something like that."
11155780,11159140," We're up for, it was like two hours or something all told."
11159140,11161660," I guess technically I didn't ask if you wanted to do the Discovery Flight."
11161660,11162660," Oh, okay."
11162660,11164900," So if you wanted to like do the whole thing."
11164900,11165900," Oh, yeah."
11165900,11166900," And I'm still down."
11166900,11167900," Yeah."
11167900,11168900," I'm still down."
11168900,11169900," But anyway, it was like $160."
11169900,11172540," It was shockingly affordable."
11172540,11179580," Both Yvonne and I got to operate the aircraft with a certified instructor in the plane with"
11179580,11180580," like both have a yoke."
11180580,11181580," It's like actually pretty cool."
11181580,11183900," Yeah, it was an absolute blast."
11183900,11190700," And it was probably the best like bang for the buck sort of premium date experience that"
11190700,11199100," I've ever had in terms of like memorability and an actual like like fun factor way better"
11199100,11201180," value than go to the movies."
11201180,11208940," Like maybe less time, but awesome, awesome, a ton of fun."
11208940,11215020," I don't know, but there was one that I remembered that was I doubt she would pick the same one."
11215020,11218060," But I do know that she remembers this event rather fondly."
11218060,11220500," We were supposed to go up to a particular lake."
11220500,11222700," I don't remember the name of it."
11222700,11224500," Harrison Lake, I think was the one."
11224500,11225500," It's just been a few years."
11225500,11227420," I don't remember which one it was."
11227420,11229740," And we were supposed to go to a particular spot on it."
11229740,11233740," And I was, I don't know if I was using my cars GPS or Google maps or whatever one it"
11233740,11234740," was."
11234740,11237260," It just didn't send us the right spot at all."
11237260,11239060," And I had never been there before."
11239060,11245900," So we ended up on like some logging road, like halfway up the lake until looking to my"
11245900,11251700," left, I noticed through the trees that we were clearly on the side of the lake."
11251700,11255020," And we were supposed to be approaching like the bottom of the lake and stopping right"
11255020,11256020," there."
11256020,11257820," So I knew we were way off of where we were supposed to be."
11257820,11259540," And this way had to turn around and go all the way back."
11259540,11262580," We ended up being super late to the event that we were trying to go to."
11262580,11269220," And then afterwards, we stayed at this Airbnb out there back when Airbnb was cool, which"
11269220,11273860," was like nowhere close to the town that we were visiting."
11273860,11282180," But I picked it because it was like this really sick, like old school farmstead as an Airbnb."
11282180,11283180," Oh, that's cool."
11283180,11285660," It was like, it was this really cool."
11285660,11292260," Taking my Acura onto a logging road was an event in its own right."
11292260,11298100," That was the day that I was like basically had to be like, all right, I'm not as worried"
11298100,11300500," about keeping this car pristine anymore."
11300500,11306460," So like cruising down a gravel logging road with rocks flying all over the place."
11306460,11309740," And I was like, okay."
11309740,11317260," But yeah, it was cool because I have always liked going through things like that with"
11317260,11318260," people."
11318260,11320620," I've always felt that as a bond strengthener."
11320620,11323260," When you're able to go through some like this kind of sucks."
11323260,11324660," We have no idea where the heck we are."
11324660,11325660," We're like up in the mountains."
11325660,11326660," We're not supposed to be up in the mountains."
11326660,11327660," We got to figure out where we're going."
11327660,11328940," We got to do this thing."
11328940,11331740," And we're doing some weird thing afterwards and you make it through and everyone has a"
11331740,11333180," good time and it's fun."
11333180,11335740," That's always like a bond strengthening thing for me."
11335740,11336740," I was like those times."
11336740,11338140," So that was a good one."
11338140,11339940," Super cool."
11339940,11341940," Oh, right."
11341940,11344780," I'm supposed to do this."
11344780,11345780," Gosh darn it."
11345780,11346780," Sorry."
11346780,11349300," I'm going through and I'm trying to reply to them right now and stuff too."
11349300,11351900," So I'm trying to help Dan."
11351900,11354060," There's only one in incoming."
11354060,11357580," Michael asks, given survivor bias."
11357580,11361740," Do you have any estimate on how many people have failed where you have succeeded in your"
11361740,11362740," business space?"
11362740,11363740," Oh, literally."
11363740,11365380," That tens of thousands."
11365380,11366380," Oceans."
11366380,11367380," Yeah."
11367380,11371620," Do you have any anonymous anecdotes on what mistakes not to make?"
11371620,11380220," I think the biggest mistake, the biggest mistakes you can make are not being true to yourself"
11380220,11382580," and not listening to your audience."
11382580,11387260," And on the surface, those might seem contradictory because how can you be true to yourself and"
11387260,11391140," listen to your audience and how can you listen to your audience while being true to yourself?"
11391140,11395100," But they actually work together because if you stay true to yourself, you should build"
11395100,11400540," an audience that will actually encourage you to stay on a path that is true to yourself"
11400540,11402100," while also being to their interests."
11402100,11404020," That's how you build the community of like-minded people."
11404020,11409820," And you also shouldn't be 100% rigid in every single thing ever."
11409820,11412540," So your audience might have good ideas and might have good feedback."
11412540,11415140," That doesn't mean you have to listen to all of it, but you should listen to some of it"
11415140,11417140," so you can grow and improve."
11417140,11418420," Yeah, agree with that."

11446260,11449460," I think Jake might have had a hand in that one as well."

11463740,11466180," games to play in its place?\""
11466180,11469540," I sort of answered this earlier as well, but like no."
11469540,11470540," Oh, that's right."
11470540,11472620," I think it's a different person asking."
11472620,11474420," Okay, what would it be?"
11474420,11476380," Like what's your alternative?"

11477860,11478860," I looked into Hunt Showdown."
11478860,11480020," I'm not that into it."
11480020,11482020," What's the difference?"
11482020,11489940," I think it's a similar type of game in a few different ways, but it's like, man, the"
11489940,11492100," last time I played it was many years ago."
11492100,11497460," If I remember correctly, it has like a horror base as well, and there's like giant spiders"
11497460,11501740," and zombies and stuff that you're fighting off at the same time, and it's just not really,"
11501740,11502820," oh, okay."
11502820,11503900," My vibe."
11503900,11507380," It has some similarities, but it's a very different game."
11507380,11510460," The community that likes that game is really into it."
11510460,11513660," So like if you want to try it, like don't let me dissuade you."

11521700,11524500," I don't know."
11524500,11528540," I guess if it doesn't have that same depth to the sim-ness of it."
11528540,11533380," You could argue that Arma does in a bunch of different ways, but then-"

11635500,11637180," With that said, I've never driven a Cayenne."
11637180,11639220," Maybe it's not very SUV-like."
11639220,11640420," Maybe it's awesome."
11640420,11642180," But I like being low to the ground."
11642180,11645740," I've always preferred to be low to the ground."
11645740,11647340," I'm really happy with it so far."
11647340,11652820," I have absolutely no regrets whatsoever, no matter how stupid some of my badminton buddies"
11652820,11655700," think I am."
11655700,11657220," One of them has an I-8."
11657220,11658220," I think it is."
11658220,11660140," Whatever that BMW-hybrid one is."
11660140,11661940," Well, that's the supercar thing."
11661940,11662940," Yeah, yeah."
11662940,11665380," It looks sick."
11665380,11672380," Very, very striking looking car with doors like this."
11672380,11674900," Not like this."
11674900,11676860," Oh, man."
11676860,11678100," Oh, right."
11678100,11679460," I'm supposed to keep doing things."
11679460,11681460," I'm sending that one to Tynan."
11681460,11683140," Okay, cool."
11683140,11686980," For Linus, have there been any discussions about offering blank tees to creators like"
11686980,11687980," go to put their designs on?"
11687980,11688980," I mean, absolutely."
11688980,11692340," It's something creator warehouse would love to get into."
11692340,11694980," It's kind of where the name came from in the first place."
11694980,11700900," There's a reason we just didn't just call it Linus Tech Tips merch company."
11700900,11701900," But it's..."
11701900,11702900," Thank goodness."
11702900,11705260," There's a lot of logistics to figure out."
11705260,11707620," You have to build those relationships."
11707620,11710140," You have to build trust with creators."
11710140,11715340," We had one fairly prominent creator recently that we were even working on some custom products"
11715340,11720140," for, but just kind of stopped replying to emails."
11720140,11724900," I'd love to know what the problem was because we actually went as far as getting samples"
11724900,11731060," in and trying to book a time with this person to show them to them so that they could tell"
11731060,11734900," us if they were good and then we could do a size run and like we were working on some"
11734900,11740940," full custom projects and just kind of disappeared."
11740940,11746420," Since then, this person has launched a merch lineup through another company."
11746420,11750940," It's kind of like, okay, well, it would have been nice to not read about that in the news,"
11750940,11753420," maybe, but hey, good luck on the launch."
11753420,11754420," I just never heard back."
11754420,11759060," I'm kind of wondering if maybe some messages got lost or something because that's sort"
11759060,11761980," of the only real thing I can think of."
11761980,11763500," But stuff happens, right?"
11763500,11767460," Life happens, business happens, and I'm not taking it personally or anything."
11767460,11771220," The point of telling the story was just that it can be very challenging."
11771220,11779740," Yeah, we'd love to, but one of the issues I think with our model is that you kind of"
11779740,11784900," have to bet big on things even for blank t-shirts."
11784900,11791500," No printing company that has decent quality is going to print 30 shirts for you."
11791500,11792500," Like that's stupid."
11792500,11795180," That's not even worth them setting up the screen printing."
11795180,11801340," So unless you're going to print hundreds of shirts, I don't even know if we can help"
11801340,11803340," you, right?"
11803340,11810660," And if you're going to print hundreds of shirts and you don't sell them, then I don't know."
11810660,11815260," We'd have to have some kind of system for passing through storage costs or something."
11815260,11816260," I don't know."
11816260,11818340," There's a lot of things to figure out."
11818340,11819340," Yeah."
11819340,11820340," Yeah."
11820340,11825580," I do know that there is a company out there that I was planning on talking to you about"
11825580,11830500," next week and we're not going to fully talk about now, but they do merch stuff and they"
11830500,11839900," have been inspired by the work of merch messages."
11839900,11840900," Oh, really?"
11840900,11842740," I'm afraid from saying copied, but..."
11842740,11843740," Oh, really?"
11843740,11844740," Yeah."
11844740,11845740," Oh, that's hilarious."
11845740,11846740," Yep."
11846740,11850060," I mean, hey, it's nice to be an innovator, right?"
11850060,11851060," Yeah."
11851060,11853460," Good job, Conrad."
11853460,11855260," Okay."
11855260,11856260," Yeah."
11856260,11862180," Edris says the 3DS and Wii U eShop are closing and access to games there is ending."
11862180,11866000," I've been buying games I wasn't able to get since I still enjoy my 3DS."
11866000,11868100," Were there any games that you enjoyed on them?"
11868100,11871040," I never had a Wii U and I never had a 3DS."
11871040,11880020," You borrowed my 2DS because I was cheap to play..."
11880020,11881020," Bravely Default?"
11881020,11882480," Yes, I did."
11882480,11883480," Yeah."
11883480,11885480," What about that?"
11885480,11886480," Okay."
11886480,11892480," Well, I played Bravely Default and that was okay."
11892480,11897480," There are better retro RPG inspired games now and Bravely Default II I finished it, but"
11897480,11899820," I like kind of forced myself to do it."
11899820,11904920," The deal for that was he was like, \"Yeah, it's going to like take me a while, so be aware"
11904920,11910120," of that, but I'm going to buy Bravely Default and if you're down, I'll borrow your 2DS"
11910120,11912080," and then you can just have the game when I'm done.\""
11912080,11914120," And I was like, \"Yeah, sure.\""
11914120,11918080," And then when you gave it back, you were like, \"I don't know if I'd bother play it.\""
11918080,11924240," So I still have the Bravely Default cartridge and have still never actually played it because"
11924240,11925240," I was just like, \"Yeah.\""
11925240,11927000," You should play Final Fantasy Tactics."
11927000,11928000," Yeah."
11928000,11932480," Or you could play my all time favorite, Final Fantasy 6."
11932480,11934720," Like he still hasn't played it."
11934720,11935720," F***."
11935720,11936920," Have you watched?"
11936920,11937920," This would take significantly less time."
11937920,11938920," I know."
11938920,11939920," I haven't watched Pirates of Silicon Valley."
11939920,11940920," This would take significantly less time."
11940920,11942840," You've watched Pirates of Silicon Valley."
11942840,11944240," Like many hours less."
11944240,11945240," I know."
11945240,11946240," Okay."
11946240,11948840," If I watch Pirates of Silicon Valley, you'll play Final Fantasy 6."
11948840,11951520," That is not an even trade."
11951520,11952520," I mean-"
11952520,11953520," But-"
11953520,11954520," Oh!"
11954520,11955520," Speaking of-"
11955520,11956520," But sure."
11956520,11957520," Speaking of terrible deals."
11957520,11958520," Okay."
11958520,11959760," I still don't know if it's okay for the birds."
11959760,11962160," I'm trying to figure it out."
11962160,11964680," It's a hard- it's not an easy answer to grab."
11964680,11965680," Okay."
11965680,11972240," Right, is he is getting a new computer and a NAS upgrade."
11972240,11976600," But all he has to do is have it be mineral oil cooled."
11976600,11978720," Or, well, a new fluid."
11978720,11979720," Yeah."
11979720,11980720," A new not mineral oil fluid."
11980720,11981720," Yeah."
11981720,11982720," My problem-"
11982720,11987480," Submerging cool is I have two small birds and there are a lot of different things like"
11987480,11991160," that that are extremely critically unsafe."
11991160,11994840," Like, we'll kill them very quickly, type of stuff."
11994840,11997040," There's a lot of different chemicals you have to stop using in your home."
11997040,12000600," If you get birds, you have to start cooking with different things."
12000600,12004200," You can't use non-stick pans and all this kind of stuff because it kills them really"
12004200,12005200," fast."
12005200,12009080," So, I need to, like, for sure make sure that it's okay."
12009080,12013200," And most things don't have like a \"Is this okay for birds or not?\""
12013200,12016400," section on their, like, product information."
12016400,12018560," So it's not necessarily the easiest thing to figure out."
12018560,12020120," But I am working on it."
12020120,12021120," I am working on it."
12021120,12026480," Dan's going to have to weigh in on this next one from Aaron S. Had to get a second pack"
12026480,12029280," of underwear because now I feel uncomfortable in anything else."
12029280,12030280," Yeah."
12030280,12031280," Relatable."
12031280,12032840," Question."
12032840,12036600," I like to buy vinyl copies of my favorite albums."
12036600,12040120," Do either of you all own any music anymore?"
12040120,12041680," Yes, of course."
12041680,12043680," I've got vinyl."
12043680,12051920," I'm of the generation where we kept highly curated MP3 folders to copy onto your MP3"
12051920,12052920," player."
12052920,12055400," So that's kind of like my generation's vinyl."
12055400,12056400," But I really like vinyl."
12056400,12057560," I think it's fun."
12057560,12060520," I don't like it because it necessarily sounds better."
12060520,12063000," I'm not going to piss anybody off by saying what I just did."
12063000,12065120," I'll crap."
12065120,12067040," A lot of people here at the office collect it too."
12067040,12068880," The covers are great."
12068880,12070600," The art is great."
12070600,12073720," I don't like buying music that I've heard before."
12073720,12079440," I will buy random, single or limited run pressings of stuff I've never heard that's"
12079440,12084320," only available on vinyl and most of it's bad."
12084320,12086040," But it's awesome."
12086040,12088040," It's like a grab bag, right?"
12088040,12091240," It's a kind of surprise of terrible, terrible music."
12091240,12092240," Okay."
12092240,12096240," I have some vinyl, but most of my vinyl I have purchased for collection reasons."
12096240,12097920," I have the Bastion soundtrack."
12097920,12100320," A lot of them are gaming soundtracks."
12100320,12102320," I think it's stupid."
12102320,12103320," So there you go."
12103320,12105680," There's the entire spectrum."
12105680,12106680," The day that I have--"
12106680,12109520," I don't think it's like cool or something."
12109520,12114400," And it's ironic because I totally have space to store records."
12114400,12119240," But I just can't think of anything less valuable that I could possibly put in that space."
12119240,12122960," Not going to lie, I got them and I used to play them because I used to do this thing"
12122960,12128880," where I would do house chores during one record and then the other card I did that in"
12128880,12129880," a minute of time."
12129880,12134880," Since I used to do that, they have definitely never been played."
12134880,12137400," And they very likely never will be again."
12137400,12140520," They're just so inconvenient at this point."
12140520,12144920," Don't tell anyone, but I kind of agree with Linus."
12144920,12152920," I have-- for what some people will spend on their vinyl collection, I have my entire"
12152920,12158480," house wired up with Wi-Fi enabled smart speakers so that I can stream anything from"
12158480,12159640," any device in my house."
12159640,12163960," My kids can into any room or any combination of rooms."
12163960,12172720," I'm sitting here going like-- that's how you do it."
12172720,12179760," Ironically, again, I actually own a turntable, but only because YouTube sent it out as like"
12179760,12181640," trendy YouTuber gift."
12181640,12187120," And I just-- it's like branded after the channel and YouTube and stuff."
12187120,12188480," It's not where I had to keep it."
12188480,12193240," Yeah, now I just have this-- well, at least you'll have something to play the LTT Christmas"
12193240,12196720," album vinyl release on."
12196720,12200400," That will not exist."
12200400,12202040," Yeah."
12202040,12207360," Linus was always curious what your go-to badminton kit is."
12207360,12210680," What like rackets, shoes, strings, tension, everything."
12210680,12211680," Okay."
12211680,12216640," So compared to-- hold on, archive."
12216640,12220760," So compared to-- how do I put this?"
12220760,12229720," So the badminton community is either kind of northern European for the most part or"
12229720,12233960," skews heavily Asian, especially Southeast Asian."
12233960,12241040," So the countries where badminton is huge, places like Malaysia, Thailand, Japan, China,"
12241040,12244440," India, like badminton is enormous in those areas."
12244440,12248360," And then Denmark of all places is like world class."
12248360,12253440," Like they have the number one men singles player right now, Victor Axelson."
12253440,12259320," So anyway, my problem is that a lot of badminton equipment tends to be designed more for an"
12259320,12261160," Asian audience."
12261160,12263840," So my shoes, for example, are--"
12263840,12264920," Oh, yes."
12264920,12271640," I have to get the whatever-- whatever the wide version of the-- I think it's like the"
12271640,12276920," 65-something W shoe or something like that."
12276920,12279720," Yeah, it's a something."
12279720,12283560," It's a Yarnix SHB-65W or something like that."
12283560,12289080," It's discontinued, but I still wear it because I bought like six of them."
12289080,12292200," Because they discontinued their wide model for a while."
12292200,12294120," Yeah, I think it's this one."
12294120,12297400," They discontinued their wide model in one generation."
12297400,12299240," I was like, you guys don't have a wide shoe anymore."
12299240,12300560," This is ridiculous."
12300560,12304880," And then when they brought it back, I was like, OK, well, I'm going to stock up on them so"
12304880,12307520," that I never have to worry about that again."
12307520,12309600," And I've actually gone through like four of them already."
12309600,12311720," So I'm down to two more."
12311720,12313600," And then I actually just switched brackets."
12313600,12318720," I just switched to the NanoFlare 700 for you."
12318720,12324120," The 5U is super cool, which it's like super, super light."
12324120,12325120," I like that about it."
12325120,12326960," But this one is not--"
12326960,12327960," NanoFlare 700."
12327960,12328960," What a name."
12328960,12329960," Yeah."
12329960,12330960," Not as fragile."
12330960,12331960," Yeah."
12331960,12333160," So there you go."
12333160,12337240," And I'm partial to hang you tournament number one shuttlecocks."
12337240,12343160," There you go."
12343160,12346960," When deciding whether to make a new video, and especially a new video that is different"
12346960,12349680," from the existing series, do you have--"
12349680,12351320," Oh, sorry."
12351320,12352320," I left something out."
12352320,12356120," I use BG80 strings, but I might need to switch because they're really delicate."
12356120,12359440," And I keep breaking them because I miss it at the top of my racket a lot because I'm"
12359440,12361680," dumb and I use too much arm and not enough wrist."
12361680,12362680," There you go."
12362680,12364480," Basically more detail than most people need."
12364480,12369040," Do you trust your experience or instinct when deciding to jump into like a new category,"
12369040,12370680," a new type of video they ever made before?"
12370680,12371680," It's got to be both."
12371680,12372880," I mean, they're inseparable for me."
12372880,12373880," So much of my instinct is--"
12373880,12377000," Or sorry, no, compared to like having a scoring system."
12377000,12378000," A scoring system."
12378000,12379200," Yeah, a systematic score."
12379200,12380200," I have no idea."
12380200,12381200," Yeah, no."
12381200,12383520," It's experience and instinct."
12383520,12386240," Obviously, you know, we will discuss things."
12386240,12388040," I don't just make unilateral decisions."
12388040,12393960," But we are-- man, when it comes to creativity, you can't just score things."
12393960,12394960," Yeah."
12394960,12395960," You can rank them."
12395960,12398320," You could go, OK, here's three ideas."
12398320,12399680," Good, better, best, right?"
12399680,12401280," But good, better, best."
12401280,12405240," But I don't think you can just quantify that stuff."
12405240,12410840," There also might be a worth in making a certain video that is not super tangible."
12410840,12411840," Mm."
12411840,12416480," Yeah, we make videos regularly that we know are not necessarily going to perform the best"
12416480,12421560," or be the lowest cost for the highest return in terms of views or sponsorship dollars"
12421560,12423000," or whatever else."
12423000,12427160," But for us, it's a long game, right?"
12427160,12433760," So we might invest a ton of time and money in having labs test some product that we know"
12433760,12439920," is going to perform mediocre at best as a video when I could just react to crazy gaming"
12439920,12444800," so it ups and sit in front of a camera for like 50 minutes and bang out a video that"
12444800,12446320," will do twice as many views."
12446320,12450080," But the reason we do that is because you guys wouldn't care about me reacting to computers"
12450080,12456520," unless we were also a reliable, valuable source of information about these products that you"
12456520,12460440," might actually buy as opposed to the ones that you just like looking at funny videos"
12460440,12461440," about."
12461440,12470480," Joseph asks, first time merch message, I was just curious if there's any companies, either"
12470480,12476160," tech or not, that you would like to see fail."
12476160,12481560," Is there anyone that you just think the world would be better off without?"
12481560,12482560," There's a lot."
12482560,12483560," Okay."
12483560,12484560," There's tons."
12484560,12485560," Okay."
12485560,12486560," Amazon."
12486560,12487560," Really?"
12487560,12488560," Fail."
12488560,12489560," Walmart."
12489560,12490560," Okay."
12490560,12494600," Name other things that are similar to that."
12494600,12495600," Gigantic big box stores."
12495600,12496600," Okay."
12496600,12497600," Hold on a second."
12497600,12499640," What about someone like a Google?"
12499640,12506640," Would you rather see them fail?"
12506640,12510040," No."
12510040,12516760," I think no."
12516760,12522800," And Amazon, when I'm saying Amazon, I'm saying what I think most people, maybe not in this"
12522800,12527360," audience, but what I think most people would imagine when they think of Amazon, which is"
12527360,12530560," like Amazon.com."
12530560,12533160," Not necessarily some of the other things that they do."
12533160,12534160," Interesting."
12534160,12535160," Okay."
12535160,12536160," Sure."
12536160,12543200," Like AWS, I'm, I'm, I, AWS is not in a monopolistic position at this time."
12543200,12544200," Yeah."
12544200,12545200," Yeah."
12545200,12546200," Okay."
12546200,12547200," There are competitors."
12547200,12549000," There are competitors that are legit and there are competitors that are thriving."
12549000,12550760," So it's like, okay."
12550760,12552640," That's all right."
12552640,12557200," But I don't, Amazon.com can, can, can, can, can, all right."
12557200,12558200," Yeah."
12558200,12559800," Man, I'm having a hard time."
12559800,12562880," Like Walmart can die in a fire."
12562880,12565840," I don't need them to, I don't need them to fail."
12565840,12568120," I just need them to not be as dominant."
12568120,12572520," Um, and like I'm, I'm generally just pro competition."
12572520,12576920," This is like the, the conversation we're having earlier about fines."
12576920,12580920," My reason for wanting these ones to fail is because of the damage that they've done"
12580920,12581920," to other groups."
12581920,12582920," Oh, I see."
12582920,12585440," So I want them to actually fail."
12585440,12591640," There are other things where it's like, okay, you're winning a little bit too hard, but"
12591640,12596480," you're not like horrifically abusing your low level employees."
12596480,12599560," So you know, maybe you could do not as well."
12599560,12600560," That would be great."
12600560,12601560," Right."
12601560,12604120," But I want those ones to fail personally."
12604120,12605120," Yeah."
12605120,12606120," Okay."
12606120,12609520," We've got just a couple more."
12609520,12613840," Uh, Jared asks, what do you think about Tesla's not being very, very friendly in regards"
12613840,12614840," to owner repair?"
12614840,12617480," Do you think electric vehicles are going to need to be worked on by manufacturers and"
12617480,12618480," dealers?"
12618480,12622880," I mean, we're generally pro right to repair across the board."
12622880,12630680," Um, and, and no, I'm, I'm not a big fan of a lot of Tesla's way of doing business."
12630680,12636480," I mean, um, as, as a member of the media in particular, and as someone who values open"
12636480,12642280," and honest communication, um, Tesla crossed a huge red line for me when they dissolved"
12642280,12648040," their PR department and basically decided they were just not going to answer questions"
12648040,12652200," about anything that was inconvenient for them."
12652200,12655640," That's not actually cool."
12655640,12658720," That's not being like a Chad or whatever."
12658720,12664120," That's, that's just deciding, making a conscious decision to not be accountable."
12664120,12671120," Um, yeah, I, I don't, I don't think that a lot of what Tesla does is, is very cool."
12671120,12672480," I don't want them to fail."
12672480,12679440," I, you know, I, overall, I, I think they, they are a force for good in the car market."
12679440,12683760," Uh, more competition is, is generally more better from my point of view, but I'm, I'm"
12683760,12686560," not a fan."
12686560,12692800," Um, I haven't seen the final mouse centerpiece keyboard anonymous."
12692800,12694720," Uh, final mouse centerpiece."
12694720,12695720," All right."
12695720,12696720," Fine."
12696720,12697720," We'll do this."
12697720,12698720," We'll do this live."
12698720,12699720," Final mouse centerpiece."
12699720,12702680," So a $350 keyboard."
12702680,12704320," Good gravy."
12704320,12706320," What?"
12706320,12707320," Okay."
12707320,12709320," There's the key."
12709320,12710320," Yeah."
12710320,12711320," Where's the key caps?"
12711320,12712360," Am I missing something here?"
12712360,12715640," Wait, that was, that's the whole thing."
12715640,12716800," Bye from final mouse."
12716800,12717800," Okay."
12717800,12719320," Now hold on just a gosh darn minute here."
12719320,12721320," Get ready for the impossible."
12721320,12724560," It will be impossible to type on this because it has no key cap."
12724560,12727320," Um, how do I, that's, this is it."
12727320,12728320," This is the whole page."
12728320,12731520," I have to click get ready for the impossible."
12731520,12734440," No, no, I can't scroll."
12734440,12735440," Was it called?"
12735440,12736440," Sorry."
12736440,12739440," Uh, final mouse centerpiece keyboard."
12739440,12745080," There's interactive display keyboard."
12745080,12746320," Okay."
12746320,12747320," So here, hold on."
12747320,12748920," We found a video official reveal."
12748920,12749920," Oh my goodness."
12749920,12751280," It's six minutes long."
12751280,12755520," Um, oh, I see."
12755520,12758600," It has an actual display under it."
12758600,12759600," Is it under it?"
12759600,12760600," Oh cool."
12760600,12761600," Yeah, it seems like it."
12761600,12762600," Or are the keys displays."
12762600,12764400," No, I think it's under it."
12764400,12766560," Because you would see the switch hardware, wouldn't you?"
12766560,12767560," Uh, you do."
12767560,12769840," Yeah, that's the switch hardware right there."
12769840,12771840," I mean, it's surprisingly see through."
12771840,12773000," That's pretty cool."
12773000,12774000," Oh, wow."
12774000,12775000," They are their arcade caps."
12775000,12776400," They're just very clear."
12776400,12777400," Okay."
12777400,12778400," That's pretty neat."
12778400,12780640," I don't think it's the kind of thing that I would spend real"
12780640,12782640," actual dollary do's on."
12782640,12784280," But, um, definitely cool."
12784280,12785880," Yeah, I don't actually like that."
12785880,12790760," I'm sure someone's going to have like a, uh, a tour walkthrough that has like a really"
12790760,12791920," cool setup with that."
12791920,12793560," That's going to look super sick."
12793560,12798880," Yeah, I, I dim my keyboard to the lowest level because I don't need the glare."
12798880,12804760," But, um, I mean, yeah, I'm cool."
12804760,12805760," Okay."
12805760,12811520," Finally, Linus and Luke, how do you intend to differentiate?"
12811520,12812760," Uh, oh, move."
12812760,12813760," Okay."
12813760,12816960," How do you intend to differentiate LTT labs in regards to testing when compared to other"
12816960,12819280," review sites such as ratings?"
12819280,12820280," That's a great question."
12820280,12825640," Um, the biggest way that we plan to differentiate is through breadth and depth, right?"
12825640,12831200," Like that's what it really comes down to is we want to test more categories, particularly"
12831200,12833200," more IT categories."
12833200,12842000," I mean, I don't think pretty much anyone like ratings is really doing a great job of"
12842000,12845320," database-like content for products like power supplies."
12845320,12848840," Um, I think that it's underserved."
12848840,12857920," And so we would, we would like to, we'd like to step in there and I fully intend to continue"
12857920,12864440," investing in the lab until we are providing the most possible depth in our, in our coverage."
12864440,12868960," So how are we going to differentiate?"
12868960,12869960," I mean, we're going to compete."
12869960,12871320," We're going to compete hard, right?"
12871320,12875240," We want, we want to, we want to be a leader."
12875240,12879640," We don't want to, we don't want to be a follower in the space."
12879640,12881320," And I think that's it."
12881320,12883360," Thank you very much for tuning in."
12883360,12885240," We will see you again next week."
12885240,12886640," Same bad time."
12886640,12888400," Same bad channel."
12888400,12889400," Bye."
12889400,12892640," That's a little short news, isn't it?"
12892640,12893800," How long was that show?"
12893800,12894800," Three hours, four minutes."
12894800,12896840," Uh, yeah, that, it flew by."
12896840,12897840," Yep."
12897840,12898840," What a world."
12898840,12899840," What a thing."
12899840,12918840," Oh, it shows brought to you by live technologies, Squarespace and, oh, balls."
12918840,12919840," What was the last one?"
12919840,12920840," It was something good."
12920840,12921840," I'm sure."
12921840,12922840," Fresh books."
12922840,12923840," There we go."
12923840,12924840," That makes sense."
12924840,12927080," (buzzing)"
