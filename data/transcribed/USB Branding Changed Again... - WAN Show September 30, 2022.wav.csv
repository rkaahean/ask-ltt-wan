0,10000," Welcome to the Wanchow everyone. We got a great show lined up for you today. Lots of fantastic topics actually. We have far, far too much to talk about."
10000,23000," I said fart. Oh, fart too much. Rest in peace. Stadia. We hardly knew. That's right. We'll be discussing the seems inevitable, wasn't it?"
23000,42000," Downfall of Google Stadia. We'll also be talking about Ryzen 7000 hot or not. Now that Intel has shown their cards, we are much better equipped to talk about who we think is going to be taking the lead in this generation of gaming performance. What else we got today?"
42000,52000," We're going to be talking about the extremely exciting things that I did yesterday. Whatever that is. And we're going to be talking about some other stuff."
52000,68000," Really Luke? USB branding? Yeah, USB branding. They're changing it again. USB to kill off, super speed, and USB 4 branding. What's happening? What is going on? If anything, those were your better ones. What are you doing?"
68000,72000," I'm rolling the intro. What? Oh, stopping."
72000,92000," [MUSIC PLAYING]"
92000,110000," The show is brought to you today by Kyoksea, 45 drives, and secret lab. All right. Why don't we jump right into the headline topic today, which is that the USB implementers forum is changing the branding again."
110000,129000," I just want to give a shout out to GD felt over on the forum. Long time member, first time poster. I actually don't know if you're a long time member, first post on the forum in 2019. Okay. So why don't we go through some of the some of what has led up to this moment?"
129000,150000," In 2019, not a long time member, the USB IF implemented the following name changes. They took USB 3.0, which was pretty strong. You get it? It's the first one. It's USB 3. You had your USB 1 and 1.1. Okay. That was the slow one. Then you had your USB 2. Okay. That was the fast one."
150000,177000," Okay. Easy. Good. Yeah. Okay. They renamed USB 3.0, which was good. To the USB 3.1 Gen 1, which is bad. Okay. They renamed USB 3.1, which was, I don't even remember now. Was that the one that was like 10 gigabit? I don't remember what the differentia. I don't remember anymore. But that got renamed to USB 3.1 Gen 1."
177000,196000," Then it got renamed to USB 3.1 Gen 2. Then later, it was actually renamed to 3.2 Gen 2. And then USB 3.2 got renamed to USB 3.2 Gen 2 by 2."
196000,224000," The group sought to make things easier for consumers by recommending to vendors that they label products not by their specification name, but by SuperSpeed USB followed by the max speed. Which, in my opinion, pretty okay. Not bad. Yeah. Okay. So for example, with that guidance, USB 3.2 Gen 2 by 2 would become SuperSpeed USB 20 gigabit per second."
224000,239000," Okay. So now the USB IF is recommending that vendors just drop the SuperSpeed. So USB 3.2 Gen 2 by 2 SuperSpeed USB 20 gigabit per second is now USB 20 gigabit per second."
239000,251000," I like it. That's actually fine. I didn't actually know the conclusion of this when we got into it. You know what's really great about it. The best thing about it is that that's what I've been doing for years."
251000,274000," Yeah. No one says SuperSpeed USB. Instead of trying to do any of this, like you guys watch me, watch me. And I don't always do it because it wasn't a formal naming convention. It was just something that I did because it was the only thing that could possibly make sense of this for me is I'll be holding up a laptop or I'll be looking at the back eye over motherboard and I'll be like, yeah, it's got four USB 10 gigabit ports."
274000,282000," Because that's the only thing anyone cared about. It's how fast does it go? I don't care how by how many things of what..."
282000,290000," SuperSpeed, whatever. Gen thing it is. I did like the logo setups that they had for it. That's a weird curveball that I'll throw at there."
290000,303000," Okay. I didn't mind that. So they have good graphic designers and bad product naming people. Well, no, like here, I'm trying to find one. I found an article from How To Geek that might have it. If I can find it."
303000,312000," No, it showed on Google Images. I hate how Google Images works now. Can I use this?"
312000,321000," I still get angry. When I right click a Google search result and go to paste it somewhere and it's like 14 miles long. Okay."
321000,326000," Okay. My generation remembers when you used to right click it and it didn't have any of that tracking crap."
326000,332000," Yeah. It was just the actual link. I need an extension or something that fixes that. I need that."
332000,339000," Hold on. Boom. There. The port and cable logo. I liked that. Is that going to change? This isn't even the one that I thought it was."
339000,344000," Which one? Darn it. Which one do you like? I brought us to the wrong thing. Okay. Widecam."
344000,352000," Where it shows the SS. I got you. Where it shows the SS thing and then it shows the cable. It has the speed under it. I thought that was good."
352000,357000," Okay. That's what I'm talking about. I'm like, \"Okay, that's a USB plug. This is the speed that it's at. I'm done. We're good.\""
357000,368000," All right. So I hope they keep the logo simple. Now, where things are going to get a little bit complicated here is that USB has gotten a lot more, well, complicated."
368000,380000," So we're dropping super speed, but what we don't know yet is how things like USB 4 play into all of this now that we're dropping the USB 4 branding."
380000,395000," Because USB 4 is not really just a new generation of USB. It also has the ability to carry a PCI express signal, which is super different."
395000,404000," That's how you can connect things like external graphics cards over a USB type C cable. So we're going to have to get a little bit further into this."
404000,419000," And we said that the logos have come out and they're similar and they're good. Okay. Another thing that we're not really addressing here is USB gets used for more than just connecting your digital camera to your computer these days."
419000,433000," We charge our devices sometimes that extremely, extremely high power like charging rates with these USB cables. And so it's a lot more than just what data rates a cable can handle."
433000,443000," It's also what gauge the wires inside it are that determines how much power that cable can actually carry. So let's go. Let's go on here."
443000,460000," USB 4 version 1.0. So that's what we would know is USB 4 right now. USB version 2. So I guess that would be USB 2 USB 3.2 super speed plus enhanced super speed and super speed with a plus sign instead of a word plus are defined in the USB specifications."
460000,471000," However, these terms are not intended to be used in product names messaging packaging or any other consumer facing content. This is from source to this is from our technical."
471000,482000," This was updated in September. They still recommend that vendors label USB 2 as high speed USB with no performance indicator."
482000,492000," Okay. Most products using USB 2 spec are peripherals like keyboards and printers so they don't think consumers will mistake the tech for being faster than say USB 5 gigabit per second."
492000,502000," Okay. The USB IF also feared people confusing USB 480 megabit per second is being faster than USB 5 gigabit per second due to the larger number. That's fair enough."
502000,508000," So why don't we just call it USB 2 because that's what we've been calling it since like 2003 or whatever."
508000,519000," That would be fine, but okay fine sure for USB C cables. They now recommend packaging and logos that show both maximum data transfer rate and power delivery. That's excellent."
519000,537000," That's actually really good. I'm done with that. But the USB IFs guidelines do not specify other capabilities like Intel Thunderbolt support whether a cable is active or passive or if it allows PCIe tunneling, which is in my opinion, the most differentiating thing about USB 4."
537000,550000," According to USB IF president and COO, consumer study groups showed that most consumers only care about the highest data performance level a product can achieve or the highest power level."
550000,555000," But that is f*cking stupid. No offense."
555000,563000," Because PCI Express tunneling is something that the average consumer wouldn't understand to tell you that they care about."
563000,570000," That's your entire job is creating branding and messaging that helps people understand the value of it."
570000,591000," And just because you've been doing this speed based marketing and branding for so long and people understand it well and tell you that they want to know about it doesn't mean that there aren't other important aspects of the specification that must be communicated."
591000,597000," Yeah. Dumb. Yep. And the USB IF never talked to us again."
597000,601000," And have they talked to you at all? I don't know. Yeah."
601000,614000," But like Ivan would tell me to be a lot nicer. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to say it's dumb and I didn't mean to say that you were an idiot and that you're bad at your job or I don't know did I say that?"
614000,622000," No. No. I don't think you said any of that before. The point is the point is that I disagree respectfully."
622000,631000," And I'm sure that you're really good at the other things that you do as president and COO of USB IF. And I'd love to work together sometime."
631000,638000," To make better branding or? I don't know. Maybe they could maybe they could show us cool USB."
638000,643000," Would you say that this is a move in the right direction? Oh absolutely. There we go. We can at least give them a win."
643000,649000," It's a step in the right direction. What? I'm sorry to talk about that before. No, no, but you're doing conclusionary statements."
649000,656000," You know. And there is a lot of good here. I would say. I don't think it's completely there. But this is a lot better than it was."
656000,662000," And this is going to be a lot more straightforward for consumers, which is good because that's kind of the point."
662000,667000," Yeah. I mean, I had already talked about this. We've been working on cables in the background for a little while."
667000,676000," And I had already said, yeah, we're just going to completely ignore whatever the USB IF says. We're just going to put the maximum data rate that can handle and the maximum power it can handle."
676000,684000," So they essentially they've just done that, which is great. That's really good. Yeah. That's a step in the right direction. Good job."
684000,691000," Yeah. I think that's about it. We're also going to put whether it supports PCI e-tunneling, though. Because that's."
691000,702000," Of course, really important. Yeah. Because we're trying to make USB cables less confusing. That's that's the point, right? But you did good. You did."
702000,708000," You did pretty good. Pretty good. All right. What do you want to talk about next? You talked Stadia? Sure."
708000,713000," Or do you want to talk about your shoes? Because I think the people are waiting for an update on your shoes."
713000,719000," I feel like that's more of a. You can't find shoes. No, I did. Okay. Well, normally can't find shoes. Yeah."
719000,727000," He's had the same shoes for so many years. I thought he was just cheap. Turns out he's cheap and he has a hard time finding those same shoes that he really likes."
727000,733000," And Luke finally found shoes that make him happy. We're talking about the shoe. I want to hear about your shoes. I want to know about your shoes."
733000,740000," We can open them because I haven't seen them yet. Yeah. Let's look. He's doing a shoe unboxing. Ladies and gentlemen. Hey, Dan, do you mind jumping on that camera?"
740000,746000," Well, you guys are getting set up for this. If you want to send a message into the show, the right way to do it is merch messages."
746000,755000," I think we probably have some new stuff from the store. Yes. Short circuit sweatpants are now available. Mystery lanyards are now available."
755000,766000," If you don't care what color lanyard you get, you can save 50%, just $4.99 for an LTT lanyard. We also have less than 10,000 of the black shaft screwdrivers left for backorder."
766000,776000," Once they're gone, they're gone. We have no plan to offer them in the future. So there's the update on LTT store. Actually, I guess I'll show you the short circuits."
776000,783000," I guess I'll show you the short circuit sweatpants real quick here. So these are some suggestions for things you guys can check out."
783000,793000," So it matches the short circuit hoodie. It's pretty subtle, honestly. It just has like zipper accents. Yeah, they go perfectly with the short circuit."
793000,803000," They're available in a bunch of different sizes, bunch of different lengths. Got nice cool lining that matches, good stuff like that."
803000,818000," So guys, you can check those out LTT store. We just find this is a better way of handling things than doing it with super chats or Twitch things or whatever else, because this way, if we don't get to your message, then you still get your order in the mail, which is pretty sick."
818000,829000," Alright, I'm switching to the Luke Cam Luke. This is it. Oh, no, that wasn't it. Oh, I gotta do this. Hey, okay. My shoes are in a bag."
829000,837000," You and so how do you know these are good? I don't. Exactly. What? You just you told me before the show that these were good."
837000,846000," They should be. Theoretically. I haven't opened them. So I don't know. I thought they're the same ones. Right now, they are shroding your shoes. Not my shoes."
846000,855000," So they could be dead. Sure. They could be alive. I mean, it's like shoes could be like holes in the bottom. So the shoes could be alive. Yeah."
855000,867000," And by observing them, they could become dead. Yeah. Okay. Well, now I really want to know what's in there. Hopefully shoes. So yeah, the idea is I bought this one pair of shoes. They worked great for me."
867000,882000," And I never wanted to get rid of them because I'd go try on other shoes and I would dislike them all the time. I hate padding around the heel. I don't roll my ankles. I've like never rolled an ankle. I don't need. How do I support it? I find it very annoying. Actually, I really hate it. So I love not having that."
882000,892000," That's bad ankles. Pass padding. I have. It might be true. His ankles have rolls so he can never roll. That would be so interesting. I don't know how to even work."
892000,903000," I have very tall feet. I have very wide feet. A lot of like running and fitness shoes don't fit me very well because of that. Yeah. These ones do. Like there's a lot of reasons why I like these shoes."
903000,915000," But through years and years and years of just trashing them like I used to box in them. They've traveled with me everywhere. They've climbed ridiculous things. They've done tons of stuff."
915000,926000," I threw them in the wash once and then transferred them to the dryer and the toe got stuck in part of the dryer and it like heat molded it into a curve."
926000,934000," And I decided to wear that out over years. Like they are old and rough and they are at the end of their life."
934000,941000," And I've been in Twitch chat says this camera is very sharp. So I'll take that as a compliment for Dan's focus control over there. Yeah, good job."
941000,946000," Good job Dan. It's actually a C200. Our wench show cameras are so overkill."
946000,956000," So these are theoretically the same shoes. The same shoes in theoretically very good condition in actually my size which is the hard part. Right."
956000,964000," I don't have like absolutely ridiculously gigantic feet but I have size 12s. Yeah. Which can be a little annoying to find sometimes."
964000,971000," So this is hopefully my new shoes. They look like they're in pretty good condition."
971000,982000," Wow. Okay. Are those the same? Yeah. Okay. And these are like, are these old or are these like a re-manufacture?"
982000,993000," These are theoretically just old actually legit shoes. I mean, I gotta say they look like, I mean, I guess like shoe enthusiasts are a big thing."
993000,1003000," Not for these. So keeping shoes in good condition I guess is a thing. They're a little worn. Even the like, even the like in soles and pretty good condition."
1003000,1010000," Yeah, like the toe, the toes a little. I don't think these have been able to be sold at a store for like seven years. So keep that in mind."
1010000,1019000," Yeah. So they've been, they've been used but they've clearly been not, you know, do they smell? No, not bad. No. They don't smell like new shoes."
1019000,1027000," No. But they don't smell like disgusting ancient gross disgusting shoes. All right. So congratulations, Luke. I feel good for you. Thanks, Dan."
1027000,1033000," Well, not really new shoes, but yeah. Yeah. So that's cool. That's a whole shoe story. Hope that was interesting."
1033000,1041000," I was planning to leave that to like way later in the show if we talked about it at all, not like the second topic."
1041000,1043000," No, I was excited to talk about it."
1043000,1050000," What's more interesting if we want to stay off topic is what I did last night, but I feel like we should talk about Stadia."
1050000,1058000," Yeah, let's talk about Stadia. Okay, you keep bringing this up. I didn't, I didn't do Stadia last night because no one did Stadia last night because it sucks."
1058000,1065000," Got him. Well, okay. Now hold on a second actually. You know why it sucks? Talk about that. Not necessarily because the service sucks."
1065000,1078000," Oh, I see. But because Google sucks. Stadia sucks because Google sucks. Stadia sucks because no one believed in it because everyone thought it would be canceled because of course it was going to be canceled because it's Google."
1078000,1083000," So no one wants to like invest in this ecosystem that they know is going to be trashed."
1083000,1092000," Yes. Trashed. He's trashed. Thrown in the garbage. Yeah, because the service itself, as far as my understanding goes, was actually like really good."
1092000,1102000," Yes. Actually quite impressive. Image quality from the last. So Gary from the lab looked at image quality for Stadia versus the G-Force."
1102000,1109000," Now I can never remember what it's called me more, but Nvidia's service. Yeah. And the Stadia image quality was better."
1109000,1113000," I've seen quite a, well, it's technologically like quite good as far as my understanding of it."
1113000,1122000," Considering how many people were using Stadia, I've seen quite a few tweets from people saying I actually loved Stadia."
1122000,1126000," The people that I know that actually used it thought it was pretty good. Yep."
1126000,1132000," But it's officially dead and with very little notice, it's going offline January."
1132000,1135000," It was present on that either. 2023."
1135000,1144000," The one of the worst parts is have you seen? Have you seen the email they sent out internally? No, I haven't actually. I heard about it, but I haven't seen it."
1144000,1154000," The email is brutal. Hold on. Let me see if I can find this. Stadia, I think I have it in my thing here."
1154000,1168000," I don't see it, but it's bad. Basically, they just sent out an email that was like, yeah, we have an all hands meeting tomorrow and you should probably prioritize being there."
1168000,1176000," Thanks, you know, about the future of development and by the way, we're shutting it down. See you later."
1176000,1182000," Now, not see you later. I think these people are being assigned to other things, but like how demoralizing is this?"
1182000,1196000," Never mind for. Oh, man, we got to talk about the impact on partners, but how demoralizing is this for a programmer, for an engineer, for anyone to put."
1196000,1203000," I mean, they didn't, they started this like almost three years ago, 2019, 2019."
1203000,1209000," Okay, I've got the email. You've got it. Okay. It's got a name on it. It's got a name on it. Oh, I mean, they shared it."
1209000,1220000," So I guess it's hard to go ahead and read it. Read it. Confidential internal only. Please do not forward. I mean, you saw how well that went. Whoever shared this, your Google email is in it."
1220000,1231000," So you probably should have not done that. But it says, Hi, everyone, we'll be having a Stadia team meeting today. Not tomorrow. Oh, sorry. I got a detail wrong."
1231000,1246000," This was sent out at 7.08 AM. We'll be having a Stadia team meeting today. September 29th at 8.30 AM. So, okay. So people have less than an hour and a half to get ready to share some important updates with everyone."
1246000,1258000," Apologies for the short notice. Yeah. We would appreciate it. If you can please prioritize attending this meeting or check in with your manager afterwards. If you can't make it details have been added to your calendars."
1258000,1268000," This will be a virtual only meeting. So please feel free to join from wherever you're working today. Best. Phil. That's it."
1268000,1277000," That's it. So they didn't say they're closing the company or whatever. But I guess they probably did an hour and 22 minutes later."
1277000,1287000," That is absolutely brutal. And as far as I can tell, literally everyone got absolutely blindsided by this."
1287000,1299000," Developers heard about it from the news. I know a lot of developers that heard about this through the news. They were actively working on actively developing things for Stadia and it just got canceled."
1299000,1313000," Looking at how Google is planning to support the users. I'm hoping they do a similar thing for the devs and make sure that they don't get just wrecked because it looks like they're doing full refunds for like basically everything."
1313000,1323000," I don't know if that's in the notes here, but they're doing refunds on hardware. They're doing refunds on purchases. As far as I know, the only thing they're not doing a full refund on is the subscription."
1323000,1334000," But like things you bought through the Play Store, whatever, they giving you full refunds for it. Do you think some people knew I still have my tab open from the Logitech cloud gaming device from last week."
1334000,1346000," And I remember it being sort of notable to me that the only cloud services they mentioned were Xbox Game Pass and GeForce Now."
1346000,1357000," And Stadia would have seemed like an obvious one to support. I mean, unless you were smart and realized that Google would probably just cancel it at some point."
1357000,1368000," Oh, wow. Apparently someone in Flowplane chat said they started rolling out a new UI update literally just hours before the announcement."
1368000,1382000," Like these people were actively moving on this stuff. That is so unfair. Internal and external team. Because there's no way that a project like that was just canceled at it wasn't a snap decision."
1382000,1395000," Like it's absolutely something where I get it. If you don't ultimately end up canceling it, you don't want people to just be sitting, you know, unsure whether they're going to have a project to work on tomorrow."
1395000,1399000," But is this really more humane?"
1399000,1411000," If Google rolled out something on the scale of something like Gmail, I don't know what it would be. I can't give you an exact tool, but on the scale of something like Gmail where it's very fundamental."
1411000,1422000," Very important. Would you even try it? Would you, okay, maybe you try it? Would you seriously try it to the point where you like migrate to it if you weren't doing it for a review reason?"
1422000,1427000," Because at this point, how do you trust them for anything, any service that they spin up they just kill?"
1427000,1438000," I'm trying to think if I use any Google service that was started up in the last 10 years. That's what I'm getting at."
1438000,1449000," I use Android. I use Gmail. I hardly touch any part of G Suite that isn't Gmail, Google Docs, Google Sheets."
1449000,1468000," I do not use things like Keep or Reminders. Reminders they just messed with again. I do not use my Google Calendar, but I use a third party app because I don't want to use their stuff."
1468000,1474000," Not like a data privacy thing, but just because I don't want things changing. I use this app called Business Calendar."
1474000,1482000," I was going to ask you because I actually didn't know you did that. Oh, yeah, Business Calendar is sick, especially on the fold, man. Check this out. Boom."
1482000,1491000," Oh, well, it's actually very readable. Yeah. And so you can just pop stuff out like this. My Calendar app is sick. It's a paid app."
1491000,1499000," I paid like five or 10 bucks for it or whatever, but it's so worth it. This is my calendar. It's dense. Information density is what I care about."
1499000,1507000," And the Google Calendar, there's nobody they have enough resolution. I'm not worried. Also, there's nothing particularly scary there."
1507000,1520000," The Google Calendar is just super, super sparse. So I'm trying to think. I use Android TV, but that's Android."
1520000,1532000," I don't need. I don't even know. I don't touch. I don't touch me. I don't touch. I use me. I use me a lot, actually. But me is very replaceable for me."
1532000,1542000," To be fair. That's the only reason why I use it. And I actually, another calendar thing that I like, a feature that I actually don't understand at all why Google Calendar doesn't have."
1542000,1550000," But is external because I believe there's some internal tools for doing this. But external people being able to book meetings on your calendar."
1550000,1557000," Maybe someone's going to school me and there's some way to do this, but I don't think so. No, you can't do it anymore. Yeah. Okay. So I use Calendly."
1557000,1563000," Yeah, you used to be able to send calendar invites by email and it would just like go right onto your calendar or something like that."
1563000,1571000," Like there was a way better way to do it. I forget the exact details. It's one of those things like, yeah, remember when we were talking about before, right clicking, copy link."
1571000,1578000," In a Google search was just the URL. Yeah, there was a simpler way to book meetings."
1578000,1588000," Like the integration between Google Calendar and Gmail was better. Maybe you guys can, maybe you guys can remind me. But either way, I use that Calendly thing."
1588000,1593000," And I just find it very easy to set up like Google meetings and stuff through all of that. So I just use Google Meet."
1593000,1601000," Mate Pause asks, is that not a thing in Outlook? Yeah, like who uses? Dance face, dance face."
1601000,1607000," [laughter]"
1607000,1612000," What year is it? Yikes."
1612000,1619000," Someone just dropped Outlook on us."
1619000,1624000," I mean, okay, if we're going to criticize Google for killing things."
1624000,1628000," At least-- At least Outlook is still around."
1628000,1632000," What about Lotus Notes? Okay, she's Lotus Notes."
1632000,1635000," [laughter]"
1635000,1637000," Oh man. Word perfect."
1637000,1641000," Everyone uses Outlook? Whoa, that's not true, dude."
1641000,1642000," Not even a little."
1642000,1645000," It's not true. Not even a little bit."
1645000,1649000," All universities use Outlook. Yeah. Like government ran institutions."
1649000,1655000," Microsoft has a lot of fingers in those. But outside of that, I don't know. I don't know about that."
1655000,1665000," Oh man, that's great. Yeah, yes. A lot of businesses do use it. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, just chill you guys."
1665000,1667000," Chill."
1667000,1673000," I cannot-- A lot of people are saying Outlook is better than Gmail. To be fair, I have not used Outlook in a long time."
1673000,1679000," Last time I used it, it was embarrassingly bad. Okay. But it's been a long time."
1679000,1681000," All right. Okay, all right."
1681000,1685000," Should we do a poll? I'm going to do a poll. You can get it on a new poll. Yeah, yeah, yeah, do a poll, do a poll."
1685000,1691000," Dan, can you think of any Gmail service that was started in the last 10 years that you use?"
1691000,1699000," You know, duo? Any like, like, what do they even do? Guys, I want to hear from you guys too. Hit me up Flowplane Chat."
1699000,1703000," Yeah, I can't think of anything like Docs and Sheets, mostly."
1703000,1714000," That's it. I mean, I guess most of the Google services that we use, we might not realize we're using new ad-serving technologies and whatnot."
1714000,1718000," Wow, this poll is very surprising so far."
1718000,1729000," What I asked is Outlook better than Gmail. Yeah, I got you. And maybe I influence this poll by making it so the no answer is saying that Gmail is better."
1729000,1735000," But a lot of people are saying that, like, the majority of people are saying that Outlook is better than Gmail."
1735000,1742000," Yeah, right here, Flowplane poll. Wow. Wow. Okay, people are talking about, like, Google Cloud."
1742000,1748000," Desktop good? Outlook on phone bad, someone said. What the devil is Google Fi?"
1748000,1753000," Oh, that's their, like, phone thing. Okay, yeah, it's not available here. It's not even in Canada."
1753000,1758000," Like, they didn't even never mind canceling it. They didn't even manage to completely roll it out."
1758000,1765000," Yeah, rip Google Play music. 100%. It was so much better than YouTube music, and I promise you, they know it."
1765000,1771000," Is Google Fi were still a thing? I don't think so. I thought they canned that."
1771000,1778000," Google Chat. Google Chat. Google Chat is just hangouts. Like, Google Glass?"
1778000,1785000," I know, I asked what you still use from the last 10 years. No. Yeah, yet another thing they abandoned."
1785000,1789000," Way to not prove the point. Oh, man."
1789000,1797000," Yeah. Rip inbox. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah. G-Pay. I don't use that."
1797000,1802000," Google Pay? That's just part of your phone. You've probably used Tap. I think you used that."
1802000,1805000," No, Samsung has their own. Oh, have Samsung phone."
1805000,1811000," And I didn't even set it up because, like, I set it up once, and then there were, like, two different ones on my phone for some reason."
1811000,1816000," Maybe one of them was the Google one, and one of them was the Samsung one. And I, like, got confused."
1816000,1823000," I was stuck without a credit card at a gas station for some reason. Long story. I lost my wallet, and I had just dropped you on off on a ferry."
1823000,1830000," So I, like, had no way to pay for fuel. And so I had Yvonne give me her credit card information so that I could enter it into my thing."
1830000,1840000," And then it went into, like, the wrong one, and then every time I, like, swipe up the thing, it's, like, the other one, and I'm just, like, you know, it really doesn't take that long to take my wallet out of my pocket, so I don't care."
1840000,1848000," It just makes no difference to me whatsoever. If I pull my phone out of my left pocket or my wallet out of my right pocket to tap to pay, I just can't."
1848000,1852000," Someone said, \"Waze.\" Yeah, but they just bought that."
1852000,1853000," They just bought that."
1853000,1854000," And when did they even buy it?"
1854000,1855000," Yeah."
1855000,1859000," Yeah, all right."
1859000,1861000," Google buys \"Waze.\""
1861000,1863000," Yeah, I do use YouTube music."
1863000,1867000," 2013. That's, like, right on the line, okay?"
1867000,1868000," Yeah."
1868000,1879000," Man, this is an interesting conversation because, you know, you kind of go, \"Yeah, Google. They're, like, a multi-billion dollar company.\""
1879000,1883000," They can make good things. And again, Stadia was good."
1883000,1884000," Well, you use a pixel."
1884000,1886000," Yeah, but grudgingly."
1886000,1887000," Well, but you do."
1887000,1889000," Technically, I probably won't make the same thing."
1889000,1894000," And the pixel program is within the last 10 years. Like, \"Yeah, but you use it.\""
1894000,1896000," Yeah, but look at the quality level of pixels."
1896000,1902000," I mean, I don't, I can't speak to that. I've never, I've never daily driven a pixel, other than just to review it."
1902000,1904000," I just, they've never pulled me in."
1904000,1908000," Google Fiber is back, apparently. Says, \"Flow Plane Chat.\""
1908000,1910000," Killed by Google.com. What is this?"
1910000,1912000," I've seen this before. I've seen this before."
1912000,1913000," I remember this."
1913000,1915000," There's a handful of people in the \"Flow Plane Chat\" posting."
1915000,1918000," 274 different things."
1918000,1919000," Yeah."
1919000,1923000," It's the end of the functionality of Google Assistant by long."
1923000,1931000," August 2023, June 2023, March 2023, January 2023, all stated for death."
1931000,1936000," YouTube Originals December 2022. Google Hangouts."
1936000,1938000," Oh my goodness."
1938000,1942000," What even is Google My Business app?"
1942000,1946000," Android Auto for phone screens? Yeah, that was kind of annoying, but that went away."
1946000,1948000," Okay."
1948000,1949000," All right."
1949000,1951000," What is Cameos on Google's?"
1951000,1954000," Wait, they had a cameo clone?"
1954000,1956000," Shut up."
1956000,1958000," I had no idea."
1958000,1960000," Okay. I'm near you."
1960000,1962000," What?"
1962000,1968000," Killed eight months ago. Cameos on Google had celebrities and other public figures to record video responses"
1968000,1974000," to the most common questions asked about them, which will be shown to users in Google search results."
1974000,1980000," Fitstar Yoga. This went on for seven years."
1980000,1984000," It created unique yoga sessions."
1984000,1988000," What?"
1988000,1994000," Poly to distribute 3D objects? What am I even looking at here?"
1994000,1997000," Google cardboard. Yeah, because that was going to work."
1997000,2001000," I can't believe that lasted for six years."
2001000,2004000," Tilt brush. Oh, I didn't even know tilt brush was dead."
2004000,2005000," That sucks."
2005000,2007000," It was actually really cool."
2007000,2009000," A couple times and then I kind of got over it."
2009000,2011000," That's probably why I canceled."
2011000,2016000," Yeah, but I know that there was artists that 100% focused on tilt brush."
2016000,2017000," Yeah."
2017000,2019000," That was their thing. And they made really cool stuff."
2019000,2024000," Cloud print is one of those things that I always thought like theoretically sounded kind of cool, but I never used once."
2024000,2029000," Apparently it was 10 years old in 2020 when it died."
2029000,2032000," Higher by Google."
2032000,2037000," I actually wanted to use this recently because I was drowning."
2037000,2040000," And yeah, it was dead."
2040000,2042000," It's also like, oh, that sucks."
2042000,2046000," Because I remember us like talking about it on when forever ago."
2046000,2048000," So I was like, oh, I'll go find that thing."
2048000,2049000," Maybe it'll be helpful."
2049000,2051000," Then yeah, I can."
2051000,2058000," To Google's credit, most things are being refunded, which is the most good guy possible way for them to do this."
2058000,2060000," Yeah. So back to the Stadia topic. Yeah."
2060000,2061000," Back to Stadia."
2061000,2063000," It sounds like they're doing it nicely."
2063000,2066000," Yeah. You don't even have to return the hardware."
2066000,2067000," You just like keep it."
2067000,2071000," I would like to see them do something with the hardware with the hardware."
2071000,2076000," I'd like I'd like to see the controllers like still work, you know, get some basic drivers."
2076000,2082000," I actually have never I've never tried to use a Stadia controller because why would I for anything for anything."
2082000,2087000," But I would like for them to still work for something. That would be great."
2087000,2088000," Apparently it does."
2088000,2089000," Apparently it does."
2089000,2089000," Okay."
2089000,2093000," Stadia controller works fine as a standard game controller on both windows and Macs."
2093000,2097000," Apparently there are some limitations, but you can use the device as a wired controller."
2097000,2103000," It doesn't work wirelessly with a standard Bluetooth controller, but you can use it wired."
2103000,2104000," So, okay."
2104000,2107000," I enjoy the idea of not having e-waste. I think that's good."
2107000,2108000," Yeah, that's good."
2108000,2114000," This move of refunding everything this this I added tells us one of two things."
2114000,2120000," Either it was costing them a king's ransom to maintain Stadia day to day."
2120000,2122000," Wouldn't be too surprised considering it was really good."
2122000,2131000," Or the point where it's cheaper to just say forget it refund it all make it go away."
2131000,2135000," Then to just leave it running indefinitely."
2135000,2141000," Or it tells us that the amount they sold was actually pretty negligible."
2141000,2145000," Which I think it might be because I think it's a little a column A, a little a column B."
2145000,2148000," Yeah, that makes sense."
2148000,2157000," Because it's one of those things where again I wouldn't trust, I don't know if you want to use the term investment for this, but I wouldn't trust investing in a platform like this."
2157000,2159000," I'd be sketched out because it's Google, right?"
2159000,2160000," Yeah."
2160000,2171000," And I feel really bad for all the developers. I hope, like I said earlier, I really, really hope that the developers internal and external are being taken care of at the same level that it sounds like the customers are being taken care of."
2171000,2173000," Because it sounds like the customers are getting a pretty good deal."
2173000,2174000," I doubt it."
2174000,2175000," I doubt it as well."
2175000,2177000," Yeah, there's just like no way."
2177000,2178000," I'm just saying I hope."
2178000,2179000," Yeah, there's just no way."
2179000,2188000," I do know that they paid a lot for getting some of the games onto Stadia, like tens of millions."
2188000,2191000," Like getting, I think they had like red dead two."
2191000,2195000," Like let's see how much red dead two was once a state."
2195000,2204000," Yeah, pay for all of this comes after CEO, Senator Pichai, Pichai, I think said he wants to make the company 20% more efficient and cut costs."
2204000,2205000," This is my problem."
2205000,2208000," I don't listen to or watch anything."
2208000,2210000," I only read."
2210000,2217000," So whenever I say people's names, like on Wanshotes, like, yeah, I've actually never heard your name spoken."
2217000,2218000," So, yeah, sorry."
2218000,2221000," I have that issue with certain words and stuff too."
2221000,2222000," Yeah."
2222000,2231000," Yeah, I don't know the exact amount, but there's an article here from Gaming Bolt that says Google spent tens of millions of dollars for red dead redemption to."
2231000,2236000," I thought they spent tens of millions of dollars for games in general."
2236000,2239000," I didn't realize it was just red dead too."
2239000,2240000," That's wild."
2240000,2245000," And then they also paid huge sums for other games to get on the platform as well."
2245000,2246000," Okay."
2246000,2248000," Wow."
2248000,2250000," And here's an interesting one."
2250000,2257000," Any exclusives that were planned for Stadia are now forever lost unless they get bought and/or ported to something else."
2257000,2265000," And based on what we know about the game development cycle, there could have easily been games that are three to four years into development right now."
2265000,2273000," And could be quite complete and might never see the light of day."
2273000,2280000," I don't know if I actually don't know of any Stadia exclusives, but you wouldn't always know about something like that."
2280000,2286000," Maybe this is the kind of thing that is going to kind of pop up over the next six to 18 months as people move on from these positions and they don't fear."
2286000,2292000," Being sued into a blivian or losing their jobs or whatever the case may be."
2292000,2294000," Oh, wow."
2294000,2297000," I don't like 100% know if there's like."
2297000,2301000," This is proof behind this or anything."
2301000,2303000," It sounds pretty legit."
2303000,2310000," There's a developer who posted in the r/game dev subreddit."
2310000,2319000," They apparently they spent four to five months building a port for Stadia and they finished the port like yesterday."
2319000,2324000," So to read it specifically says we've been working on our Google Stadia game port for a few months."
2324000,2329000," The first time we had about 20 plus issues to solve two weeks later Stadia showed us 10 more."
2329000,2332000," So sounds like they were trying to help them, which is actually good."
2332000,2337000," We spent four to five months fixing everything, learning the technology behind it and preparing your game port."
2337000,2342000," On September 29th, we had repaired 100% of our faults and we're ready to launch Stadia."
2342000,2346000," Today I was hustling and staying up late in the office to send the last build."
2346000,2351000," Our build could be the last dispatch build in Stadia's history."
2351000,2352000," That's wild."
2352000,2354000," We wish that we wish to arrive at this platform."
2354000,2357000," It's really sad for his stadium, police, et cetera, et cetera."
2357000,2365000," Google is offering to continue supporting gaming in other areas and will help devs build and distribute gaming apps on Google Play and Google Play games."
2365000,2368000," Thanks Google. How long will Google Play and Google Play games exist?"
2368000,2370000," How long will that help exist?"
2370000,2371000," I don't know."
2371000,2378000," Man, you guys got to shake this reputation of just like throwing things at the wall and then even the ones that stick,"
2378000,2385000," just letting them fall off the wall eventually or rot on the wall, rot on your, you got like a rotten spaghetti wall now."
2385000,2388000," Like I just don't understand what is going on over there."
2388000,2389000," It's brutal."
2389000,2398000," Consumer trust, I hope is low at this point, to be honest, because like, wow, brutal."
2398000,2400000," Hope people can migrate game data."
2400000,2401000," I didn't even think about that."
2401000,2402000," Yeah, that sucks."
2402000,2403000," Oh, that's why."
2403000,2407000," This is one of the reasons why I wouldn't want to adopt a platform like that."
2407000,2411000," You know that Fantasian game that I'm waiting to play because it's exclusive to Apple Arcade?"
2411000,2413000," That's why I'm not, that's why I'm not playing it."
2413000,2413000," Yeah."
2413000,2418000," It's not that I'm not willing to just pay for Apple Arcade for a month or two while I play this game or like whatever."
2418000,2422000," That's not like I don't have plenty of iOS devices, fine, whatever, I'll play a game."
2422000,2425000," But I don't want my save data there."
2425000,2430000," I want my save data on something that I think might actually exist at some point, like on a physical device that I own."
2430000,2431000," Yep."
2431000,2445000," And this is, this is a huge, huge knock for cloud gaming because I don't think that everyone would go back to a game that they played, you know, five years ago or something like that and want their save data."
2445000,2452000," But I have some games, sorry to cut you off, I have some games where if there's like a note taking system or something in the game."
2452000,2453000," Yeah."
2453000,2456000," I'm pretty sure this is the last time I'm going to log off for a while."
2456000,2462000," I'll like leave my character looking at it and like write myself a note of like this is what you were doing."
2462000,2463000," Yeah, for sure."
2463000,2469000," Like if I ever wanted to go back and play Dragon Age Origins with my character, I could save file on my server."
2469000,2470000," Like I have it, right?"
2470000,2471000," Right."
2471000,2473000," And that's, that's something that's not an option here."
2473000,2483000," We've apparently been offered a Stadia Dev Kit from a developer who was going to launch a title on Stadia Pro next month."
2483000,2485000," I guess that, do you guys want to see it?"
2485000,2487000," You guys want to see a Stadia Dev Kit?"
2487000,2488000," That'd be interesting."
2488000,2490000," I, I'd be pretty interested to see it."
2490000,2492000," Like what, what would a Stadia Dev Kit be?"
2492000,2494000," Because it's like just a red, right?"
2494000,2497000," Is it just, yeah, is it a little tiny little mini server?"
2497000,2498000," How many days is that?"
2498000,2504000," Apparently someone has a Red Dead Redemption 2 game on Stadia with 6,000 hours on it."
2504000,2505000," Wow."
2505000,2506000," Okay."
2506000,2508000," I mean, is some of that just leaving it idling?"
2508000,2510000," Are you the reason they had to shut it down?"
2510000,2513000," [Laughs]"
2513000,2516000," Like we've been transmitting the same frame for four months."
2516000,2518000," Two hundred and fifty days."
2518000,2520000," For a lot more than four months."
2520000,2523000," We've been transmitting the same frame for nine months."
2523000,2525000," [Laughs]"
2525000,2526000," Oh no."
2526000,2532000," I know there's some people that are like really, really hardcore into the like online gang system"
2532000,2534000," in Red Dead."
2534000,2535000," Terrible."
2535000,2538000," Apparently there's an article about it."
2538000,2539000," Wow."
2539000,2541000," That's so brutal."
2541000,2542000," Okay."
2542000,2547000," You guys can stop posting about the 6,000 hours thing."
2547000,2548000," Come on."
2548000,2550000," Don't spam so much."
2550000,2551000," Okay."
2551000,2552000," Let's move on."
2552000,2556000," I feel like we should probably get some sponsors done here."
2556000,2561000," And then we'll talk about the recall on the backpack."
2561000,2563000," Oh, trust me, bro."
2563000,2564000," We'll take care of it."
2564000,2565000," All right."
2565000,2566000," All right."
2566000,2569000," The show is brought to you today by Kyoksea."

2692000,2694000," Alright."
2694000,2697000," So."
2697000,2702000," We haven't encountered an issue. Dan, you're on the camera again if you don't mind terribly."
2702000,2710000," We have encountered a user reported issue with the Carabiner zipper pulls on the LTT store backpack."
2710000,2716000," Actually, I'll start by giving you a sample of one that is not broken."
2716000,2721000," Well, here, actually, I'll hold it up and I'll show you the first two."
2721000,2725000," Then I'll get your impressions for some of the ideas that we have."
2725000,2728000," This didn't come up during testing."
2728000,2729000," Oh, right."
2729000,2730000," I guess I'm supposed to..."
2730000,2731000," Well, not that one."
2731000,2732000," Gosh, darn it."
2732000,2733000," There we go."
2733000,2734000," Okay."
2734000,2735000," You know what?"
2735000,2736000," I'm going to come a little closer to you, Dan."
2736000,2743000," This didn't come up during testing, but what we found is that these custom carabiner..."
2743000,2749000," These custom carabiner zipper pulls that are attached to the zippers with these little loops here."
2749000,2750000," There you go."
2750000,2753000," And they have like a little carabiner doodad on them."
2753000,2754000," You guys can see that pretty well there."
2754000,2755000," Yep."
2755000,2756000," That's cool."
2756000,2763000," They were custom designed for our backpack and they only have a very, very skinny little bit of metal here."
2763000,2765000," That's really hard to see."
2765000,2766000," I think so."
2766000,2768000," Looking at that, I think so."
2768000,2770000," The background is too dark against the..."
2770000,2771000," Well, I got my hand here."
2771000,2772000," Yeah."
2772000,2773000," Oh, here."
2773000,2774000," Well, hold on."
2774000,2775000," Idea."
2775000,2777000," Back of the laptop, maybe?"
2777000,2778000," Oh, yeah, sure."
2778000,2779000," Let's go back to the laptop."
2779000,2780000," Yeah, that works."
2780000,2781000," Okay."
2781000,2782000," Yeah, there we go."
2782000,2784000," No, no, you can leave your laptop there."
2784000,2785000," I got the..."
2785000,2786000," Yeah."
2786000,2787000," That's pretty..."
2787000,2788000," Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
2788000,2789000," Okay."
2789000,2790000," So it's got a little..."
2790000,2791000," A little wiggle-wobble thing here."
2791000,2801000," Unfortunately, and this never came up during our testing because I only ever used these to clip to each other to keep the zipper from coming open and just to kind of look cool."
2801000,2809000," So maybe someone grabbed it funny or maybe they tried to hang something from it, which I'm not really intended for, but..."
2809000,2814000," Given how much work we put into the durability of other aspects of the bag, we should have caught it."
2814000,2815000," Yeah."
2815000,2821000," There's only a skinny little skinny chicken piece of metal here that holds this in place."
2821000,2829000," So while the spring is fine, and it'll last for a long time like this, if you put pressure on it from the side..."
2829000,2830000," Ooh."
2830000,2832000," You can break it off pretty easily."
2832000,2833000," Wow, yeah."
2833000,2835000," Yeah, that was not a ton of force."
2835000,2836000," No."
2836000,2837000," So..."
2837000,2838000," It..."
2838000,2844000," To be clear, past third-party lab tests, so our supplier follows ISO 9001 for quality."
2844000,2846000," Past testing within their system."
2846000,2850000," And through our third-party lab for expected force applied during normal use."
2850000,2857000," However, there will always be some part-to-part variance across 160,000 pieces, right?"
2857000,2858000," There's four per bag."
2858000,2873000," So there's always going to be a failure rate, but it's clear that this is a core component that I think just accidentally could have a higher failure rate than we consider to be acceptable."
2873000,2874000," So..."
2874000,2875000," Nope, you're not done yet, Dan."
2875000,2876000," I'm so sorry."
2876000,2879000," You've got to have a look at some of our new options."
2879000,2880000," Okay."
2880000,2882000," So what are we doing from here?"
2882000,2892000," We're actively working on a solid long-term solution, which should include a care package for everyone who bought the backpack that will include three things."
2892000,2897000," Standard regular zipper pulls for people who want to opt out of the carabiner entirely."
2897000,2899000," And there are reasons people might want to do this."
2899000,2905000," Maybe they want to put a padlock on it for even more security, or if they want to check their bag or whatever the case may be."
2905000,2906000," That is some feedback that we got."
2906000,2909000," So I guess this is an opportunity to rectify that."
2909000,2911000," We are also working on..."
2911000,2915000," It will also include an updated carabiner pull."
2915000,2917000," And we are working on..."
2917000,2920000," We've actually already prototyped it, but they didn't give it to me for the show today."
2920000,2928000," We're working on just a cheap injection molded tool that will help you pry up the little retainer"
2928000,2930000," for the carabiner pull that you have on there."
2930000,2939000," And then the other end should allow you to clamp it back down and replace it with either a standard zipper pull or a replacement carabiner pull."
2939000,2944000," So this is to everyone who has currently received backpacks? What about the staged orders?"
2944000,2945000," I believe..."
2945000,2949000," Actually, that's a good question. I don't know what will happen with those. We'll figure it out."
2949000,2950000," Okay."
2950000,2955000," It should be a fairly small operation to swap them, so either we'll swap them or we'll include the swap kit."
2955000,2958000," It seems to make more sense for us to swap them."
2958000,2964000," But I don't know the answer to that, so we'll have to figure that out for you."
2964000,2965000," Alright."
2965000,2978000," So in the meantime, here are some examples of carabiner pulls that we are looking at that you might end up getting because the original one is not so great anymore."
2978000,2983000," You know what? No, I'll show you this one after. Let's start with this one."
2983000,2987000," And, Luke, do you want to kind of have a look at these and tell us your thoughts?"
2987000,2988000," How is this going to zipper?"
2988000,2990000," Well, it would be a lot smaller."
2990000,2991000," Okay."
2991000,2993000," But it would be kind of like that."
2993000,2994000," Yeah."
2994000,2997000," Do you want to hold it just a little more in front of the laptop?"
2997000,2999000," It's still... it's just a little odd."
2999000,3004000," You can still get some side to side play, but I'm putting quite a bit of force on that and other things really happen."
3004000,3006000," Yeah, well, locks. That's the difference."
3006000,3007000," Yeah."
3007000,3010000," Anything that locks is going to be a little bit better."
3010000,3014000," Yeah. Yeah. I pushed pretty hard in both directions."
3014000,3016000," Yeah, it's ugly and looks like crap."
3016000,3017000," Yeah, pretty much."
3017000,3018000," So it's out."
3018000,3019000," We've also got this one."
3019000,3020000," It's also like..."
3020000,3022000," Dan, don't try to follow us too much. We'll follow you."
3022000,3023000," We can see it."
3023000,3027000," This one just has like a little wire magic here."
3027000,3029000," This is similar, but only one direction."
3029000,3031000," No, no, I got to hold this way closer."
3031000,3032000," Okay."
3032000,3033000," Let's get this boy."
3033000,3035000," Let's get this boy close."
3035000,3036000," There you go."
3036000,3038000," So it's just a little wire thing."
3038000,3044000," Looks like crap, especially compared to the original carabiner pole, so I don't consider this acceptable either."
3044000,3047000," Both of these are cheap, so that's a good thing about them."
3047000,3052000," This one is, I'd say, the closest to our existing carabiner pole."
3052000,3056000," So that have like basically shields on each side holding it in place?"
3056000,3057000," Is that what's going on?"
3057000,3058000," It's a lot thicker metal."
3058000,3064000," We could also re-engineer the original one to have like thicker metal sides like this one does,"
3064000,3067000," but we found a solution that we like better."
3067000,3070000," Okay, this one I'll let you play with."
3070000,3073000," It's really expensive."
3073000,3074000," Of course."
3074000,3079000," I have, I have, no, no, Dend, here, here, here, here, here."
3079000,3081000," I have notoriously expensive taste."
3081000,3083000," It looks beautiful."
3083000,3085000," Is this how it will look like final product?"
3085000,3088000," No, it'll be smaller because it's really big."
3088000,3092000," So it'll, but it'll probably look very similar to this."
3092000,3095000," The camera can't see it at all, but it looks like it's like tempered."
3095000,3097000," Is that?"
3097000,3098000," It's titanium."
3098000,3100000," Oh, okay."
3100000,3103000," I'm really glad at one point in the development process."
3103000,3105000," That doesn't have structural issues?"
3105000,3107000," Hold on, we'll talk about it in a second."
3107000,3108000," Okay."
3108000,3112000," At one point in the development process for the backpack, we considered having carabiner"
3112000,3116000," poles on every single zipper and we were like, \"Ah, it's a bit much.\""
3116000,3117000," Given the cost of this."
3117000,3121000," How much is, is this like, I'm really glad it's only four per bag."
3121000,3123000," We'll be okay."
3123000,3124000," But how much is this?"
3124000,3125000," It's really nice."
3125000,3126000," Here."
3126000,3130000," If you bought that individually, it would be like double digit dollars."
3130000,3132000," No, it'll run you."
3132000,3133000," Shoot, wrong thing."
3133000,3134000," Bloody hell."
3134000,3135000," Okay, there you go."
3135000,3136000," So here's what it is guys."
3136000,3138000," It's a one piece."
3138000,3140000," Here, I'll hold it here."
3140000,3143000," It's a one piece titanium clip here."
3143000,3145000," You got to show the bottom when you did that."
3145000,3146000," And then the hinge."
3146000,3149000," Yeah, the hinge is just like this."
3149000,3151000," It just bends."
3151000,3152000," Yeah, it just, yeah."
3152000,3154000," It just bends."
3154000,3157000," It's got like this, I don't know, shape to it."
3157000,3158000," Kind of, yeah."
3158000,3159000," Okay."
3159000,3160000," Oh, there you go."
3160000,3161000," There you go."
3161000,3162000," There you go."
3162000,3164000," It's got these like slits in it."
3164000,3167000," But because it's titanium, it's super strong."
3167000,3169000," And so it bends both here."
3169000,3171000," Have you gone side to side?"
3171000,3175000," And then, yeah, well side to side, it doesn't give any F's because it's titanium."
3175000,3176000," Right?"
3176000,3178000," So you can just, I don't know, do whatever you want to it."
3178000,3180000," So it looks like it moves the fair amount, but it's not going to bring."
3180000,3182000," Yeah, so it might have a little bit of play."
3182000,3183000," It's not going to break."
3183000,3184000," But it shouldn't break."
3184000,3186000," So this is the, thanks Dan."
3186000,3187000," You're good."
3187000,3189000," This is the current front runner solution."
3189000,3193000," So everyone who gets a bag will get something."
3193000,3205000," And it'll either be like a pack of something like this and standard pulls or a re-engineered version of the original carabiner pull and standard pulls."
3205000,3207000," And then we're going to be working on that tool."
3207000,3214000," One thing that I want to warn you guys about now, don't feel like, oh yeah, this weekend, I'm going to go do this."
3214000,3215000," So I'm going to change my pull."
3215000,3217000," No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
3217000,3223000," The way that the YKK zipper is designed is to be permanently installed."
3223000,3227000," So yes, you can bend it up and you can bend it down."
3227000,3230000," Like once."
3230000,3232000," Otherwise, a lot of metal doesn't like doing that."
3232000,3235000," Yeah, it'll fatigue the metal and it will break."
3235000,3239000," So please, plus no, plus no do that."
3239000,3245000," And that's not the kind of thing that we're going to be like, oh, this is your third bag."
3245000,3247000," Yeah, well, you know, these things happen."
3247000,3248000," Here's the new one."
3248000,3250000," Like, don't do that."
3250000,3259000," That's intentional damage because it will be very clear in the packaging of the replacement kit that you are intended to do it once."
3259000,3261000," A bunch of people say they like the S carabiner."
3261000,3263000," That looks like the ugliest one out of all."
3263000,3264000," Like ass."
3264000,3268000," And scaled down to the size of a zipper pull, it's not going to work very well."
3268000,3272000," It's not an appropriate design for what we're doing."
3272000,3273000," Yeah."
3273000,3281000," As a former fastener salesman, please reach out to a smaller fastener specialist for more and cheaper options."
3281000,3283000," Please, please."
3283000,3286000," I mean, it's not a fastener though."
3286000,3289000," It's like, it's kind of just a decorative zipper pull."
3289000,3291000," Like it's not intended to really do anything."
3291000,3292000," That was another thing."
3292000,3297000," I saw a picture of someone talking about this and they were like, this isn't built like how it should be."
3297000,3299000," And then they had like a climbing carabiner."
3299000,3301000," I was like, these are not."
3301000,3302000," Yeah, it's not for climbing."
3302000,3304000," They just link together."
3304000,3306000," They're not supposed to be load bearing."
3306000,3310000," They are just that side to side pressure was unacceptable."
3310000,3312000," But they're also not for that."
3312000,3321000," Mark asks, why even show the ones you're not considering to show you guys kind of what we looked at to ultimately reach what we think is going to be our best option."
3321000,3323000," So that you guys can understand the process."
3323000,3328000," Are you complaining that we're just being transparent?"
3328000,3329000," I don't get it."
3329000,3333000," If we're at risk, if we use the fancy one, if that was a thing, we wouldn't use it."
3333000,3340000," We will find a very good solution that people will be very happy with and everything will be okay."
3340000,3342000," Don't worry guys, we got this."
3342000,3344000," Yeah."
3344000,3347000," All right."
3347000,3349000," Oh, in other."
3349000,3353000," It's not a recall in the sense that people have sent their bags back."
3353000,3354000," No."
3354000,3355000," Yeah."
3355000,3362000," No, it's, I mean, you can recall a component of something and the solution is just to send people a new that thing."
3362000,3363000," Yeah."
3363000,3364000," Cool."
3364000,3366000," So that's the way we're going to handle it."
3366000,3370000," All right."
3370000,3378000," In other controversial news, the Ura ring, or our ring, excuse me, video got pulled from short circuit."
3378000,3379000," This week."
3379000,3380000," Yeah."
3380000,3382000," I know nothing about this, but that was very surprising."
3382000,3383000," Yeah."
3383000,3391000," So our history with our, and I'll explain why I've changed my pronunciation here in a moment,"
3391000,3393000," our history with them is a little complicated."
3393000,3401000," First, we were going to do a sponsored video for their Gen 2 ring, which they sent us, and I used for a while and liked."
3401000,3406000," Then that never happened, or maybe we shot it and like ultimately didn't publish it."
3406000,3408000," That somehow the deal fell through."
3408000,3411000," I'm like, okay, you know, it happens, right?"
3411000,3413000," I liked the product."
3413000,3420000," I got an upgrade offer to the Gen 3 ring that would make it so that I would not have to pay the monthly fee."
3420000,3428000," They basically said, if you have a Gen 2 ring and you upgrade to the Gen 3, you will be grandfathered in for life to not have to pay the monthly subscription."
3428000,3430000," I was like, I like this product."
3430000,3433000," I do not like monthly subscriptions."
3433000,3434000," Fine."
3434000,3436000," So the Gen 3 ring has some feature, cool new features."
3436000,3438000," I don't really care about them, but sure."
3438000,3440000," So I was using that for a while."
3440000,3441000," Maybe they saw me using it."
3441000,3444000," I know a lot of you saw me using it and asked, oh, what's that?"
3444000,3445000," How do you like it?"
3445000,3446000," Et cetera, et cetera."
3446000,3449000," So they find, they reached out and they were like, okay, let's try this again."
3449000,3452000," So their new Gen 3 Horizon design, they sent it over."
3452000,3454000," We shot a sponsored short circuit."
3454000,3456000," We got as far as uploading the video."
3456000,3459000," In the, in the video, I talked a lot about how it is a product."
3459000,3461000," I actually use, I like it."
3461000,3463000," Of course, any sponsored video, I still can't say anything."
3463000,3465000," I don't actually believe like by law."
3465000,3467000," Some people don't take that very seriously."
3467000,3468000," I do."
3468000,3470000," So everything I said was stuff that I believed."
3470000,3474000," And one of the things I believed was that the pronunciation of their company,"
3474000,3477000," O-U-R-A was URA."
3477000,3479000," It's not."
3479000,3480000," It's ARRA."
3480000,3482000," Like A-U-R-A."
3482000,3483000," So."
3483000,3488000," To be completely honest, I thought their company was named A-U-R-A."
3488000,3489000," No."
3489000,3490000," It's O-U-R-A."
3490000,3494000," Because I don't think, I think I've heard you say it more than I've read it."
3494000,3496000," So I always just thought it was."
3496000,3497000," Yeah."
3497000,3498000," Anyways."
3498000,3499000," Anywho."
3499000,3502000," So I said it wrong."
3502000,3503000," Repeatedly."
3503000,3504000," In the video."
3504000,3508000," Because, and this kind of ties into what I said earlier in the show about,"
3508000,3509000," I only read things."
3509000,3511000," I don't watch or listen to them."
3511000,3515000," So I have only, the only context I have is how it's spelled."
3515000,3520000," And, you know, I think that at this stage in our company,"
3520000,3525000," we should probably have processes for making sure that the pronunciation of things,"
3525000,3528000," particularly on a sponsored video is correct."
3528000,3533000," But it slipped through the cracks and we shot a whole video with the name wrong."
3533000,3536000," They were apparently very upset."
3536000,3541000," And we offered a fix, which was, I think we were going to use the YouTube editor to be like,"
3541000,3545000," \"LOL lines got the name pronounced wrong.\""
3545000,3547000," And a pinned comment, they weren't happy with it."
3547000,3551000," And trigger happy newbie here by the name of Colton."
3551000,3554000," Reacted to this by pulling the video."
3554000,3561000," Actually, it was a decision that was made in the business department before I really got an opportunity to weigh in on it."
3561000,3569000," We were told that there was no way for us to make a change to the video to alter the pronunciation."
3569000,3572000," Because of YouTube's policy."
3572000,3575000," But I was like, \"Okay, yeah, but I might have been able to call people.\""
3575000,3577000," Once the video is pulled, it's like dead."
3577000,3578000," You can't."
3578000,3580000," Like, yeah, you can put it live again, but nobody's going to watch it."
3580000,3586000," Like, that initial burst from publishing, unless it's, you know, a miracle viral video,"
3586000,3588000," it's not going to, it's not nothing good."
3588000,3590000," It's going to come of it if you republish it."
3590000,3591000," But so it was pulled."
3591000,3593000," So it was kind of too late to do anything about it."
3593000,3596000," And I might have not been able to do anything about it anyway."
3596000,3597000," It might have been the same decision."
3597000,3605000," So really, this is just about maintaining transparency for you guys, not blaming anyone."
3605000,3607000," It was a team decision that was made."
3607000,3608000," I was not informed."
3608000,3612000," But I might have made the same decision anyway."
3612000,3615000," So the bottom line is we pulled the video."
3615000,3616000," We're not putting it back up."
3616000,3620000," This isn't the first time we've had difficulty dealing with Aura."
3620000,3622000," I like the product."
3622000,3627000," But, you know, I don't think they're bad thing, bad people or anything."
3627000,3632000," I just think it's fair to say that we are unlikely to attempt to work with them again at this point."
3632000,3634000," And it's left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth."
3634000,3636000," It wasn't entirely their fault for sure."
3636000,3638000," Like, you know, I get it."
3638000,3645000," But also, you know, I think their reaction was not really helpful."
3645000,3647000," I don't think it was really constructive."
3647000,3652000," I also don't think that it was an unmakeable mistake."
3652000,3656000," Oh, you are a."
3656000,3658000," I would have guessed."
3658000,3665000," Yeah, maybe you should have paid for, you know, the domain and trademark Aura a you are a if that's what you wanted."
3665000,3669000," Like you can't just spell stuff wrong and then be like, what made you pronounce it?"
3669000,3671000," Like, come on, guys."
3671000,3677000," There's also like tons of different things like that that get quote unquote pronounced wrong."
3677000,3681000," Someone in full plane chat mentioned Nvidia tie."
3681000,3688000," Yeah, no one at Nvidia even knows whether it's TI or tie or a Seuss in general."
3688000,3690000," There's lots of them."
3690000,3693000," The better way to do it is to attack with humor."
3693000,3702000," They made some like joke videos back in the day about how to pronounce their name and stuff."
3702000,3707000," Oopoo Lance GT in Twitch chat says the ooh yeah pronounced it."
3707000,3708000," Ooh yeah."
3708000,3711000," So it's not like I was coming at this completely out of nowhere."
3711000,3713000," I didn't even think about that."
3713000,3717000," Like it's just one of the things is you never know where the root language is from."
3717000,3723000," So those letters in combination from different root languages might make different sounds and stuff."
3723000,3731000," Like it's actually really hard to just read something in, you know, English letters and know what it means."
3731000,3736000," Cyan waves says I agree Linus you should have done diligence and taken the error on the chin your fault."
3736000,3743000," Yeah, but it's not about fault, you know, like in business you can you can take a very hard line stance like that."
3743000,3747000," Then you don't have a video given to tons of people about your product."
3747000,3748000," It's not constructive, right?"
3748000,3753000," Like it's about it's about finding a fix that works for everyone and getting it done, right?"
3753000,3756000," So yeah, sure, a sign blame go ahead."
3756000,3759000," But it's not helpful, right?"
3759000,3762000," So it's about what are you trying to do?"
3762000,3766000," Are you trying to just kill a relationship and never work together again?"
3766000,3768000," Then by all means be like that, right?"
3768000,3776000," If you're trying to fix it and trying to move forward, which is what smart business people do, then you got to take a different stance, right?"
3776000,3782000," Like you got a I mean anyone that I've ever coached on email etiquette, probably including you."
3782000,3795000," One of the first things I'll tell you is even though you know 100% that it's the other person's fault and that they're an idiot and they're ass covering or whatever, the first thing you do is say, I'm sorry I might have misunderstood."
3795000,3805000," Yeah, that's actually been one of the most useful things too because a lot of the times you can be like 95, 98% sure you're right."
3805000,3814000," But if you say I might have misunderstood, it's very likely you'll get more information and then they will end up figuring out that they made the mistake, which is just easier for everyone."
3814000,3815000," It's simple math."
3815000,3818000," The second you attack someone, they will be defensive."
3818000,3819000," It's a battle now."
3819000,3821000," They are on the defense."
3821000,3826000," And in a lot of situations you don't want a battle, you want a resolution because you just want the problem to be fixed."
3826000,3836000," So it's easier to just be like, whatever I might have misunderstood is a way to say like I'm not placing blame, but let's just solve the problem, which is better."
3836000,3838000," M hindman says, \"Lina, stop putting your foot in it.\""
3838000,3842000," In that last segment you threw your staff under the bus and criticized the sponsor."
3842000,3844000," I'm telling you guys what happened."
3844000,3846000," That's what happened."
3846000,3848000," What more can I say?"
3848000,3852000," Did I say that I pronounced it right?"
3852000,3854000," No."
3854000,3856000," Did I say I did my due diligence?"
3856000,3857000," No."
3857000,3859000," Did I say I pronounced it wrong and that I didn't do my due diligence?"
3859000,3860000," Yes."
3860000,3861000," Okay."
3861000,3865000," What do you guys, what do you guys, what do you, like what ultimately what do you want from me, right?"
3865000,3870000," Like what can I do, what can I do other than be transparent?"
3870000,3872000," Should I just not tell you things?"
3872000,3876000," I feel like we've run into this a fair bit lately."
3876000,3877000," I've brought this up before."
3877000,3879000," This is actually a really big problem."
3879000,3881000," The way I brought it up is devs on stage."
3881000,3882000," Yeah."
3882000,3888000," A lot of people want to hear directly from developers very often, but then when a developer missteps"
3888000,3893000," or says something slightly incorrectly or says a thing that people decide that they shouldn't"
3893000,3898500," have, one of the examples that I bring up is the don't you guys have phones comment from"
3898500,3899500," the Blizzard developer?"
3899500,3901000," Like, yeah, that was stupid."
3901000,3902000," Of course."
3902000,3905000," Both other people in this room cringed when I said it."
3905000,3906000," That was really stupid."
3906000,3912000," But the more you really heavily attack stuff like that, the less devs on stage."
3912000,3913000," That's true."
3913000,3917000," Because they're going to throw a PR person at you and like, is that really what you want?"
3917000,3921000," Because you got to think about what you're attacking and what you're criticizing, right?"
3921000,3923000," It gets a little sketchy."
3923000,3927000," If you want the real information, if you want the knowledge, whatever, you got to be a little,"
3927000,3929000," you got to take it sometimes."
3929000,3930000," Yeah."
3930000,3934000," And sometimes that dev on stage is going to say something real down, but you still want that"
3934000,3935000," stage."
3935000,3936000," All right."
3936000,3938000," You think you want it, but you don't?"
3938000,3939000," Yeah, that's another quote."
3939000,3941240," Blizzard has a lot of them."
3941240,3945400," But Blizzard has put devs on stage at BlizzCon for a long time."
3945400,3946400," So like, it makes sense."
3946400,3948600," They're going to say some dumb stuff."
3948600,3950800," And it is what it is."
3950800,3957000," On the subject of dumb stuff, the Lab 32 branding is officially dead."
3957000,3958000," Satch."
3958000,3962520," I want to make it very clear that it had nothing to do with Sarah Deachy."
3962520,3966320," She was an absolute gem about the whole thing."
3966320,3971120," She basically was like, \"Yeah, I mean, seems pretty chill to me."
3971120,3972120," Here's what we have."
3972120,3975960," Have I talked about this already on my show?\""
3975960,3976960," No, I don't think so."
3976960,3977960," I've gotten like a Deja vu moment."
3977960,3978960," Well, at any rate, I've talked about it."
3978960,3979960," The cancellation of the name."
3979960,3980960," Yeah."
3980960,3983520," You've talked about the situation that's going on, but I don't think you've talked about"
3983520,3984520," us."
3984520,3985520," Oh, okay."
3985520,3986520," Not right with the name."
3986520,3987520," So she was super chill about it."
3987520,3988520," Amazing."
3988520,3989960," She was like, \"Yeah, we'll make it work."
3989960,3991960," We'll figure it out.\""
3991960,3998560," And ultimately, because we found out that there was a 30-day return period for the domain,"
3998560,4005920," we kind of went, \"Yeah, thank you, Sarah, for real, like, what a bro."
4005920,4011600," But we're just going to figure out something else so that we don't have to worry about"
4011600,4013760," any kind of misunderstanding."
4013760,4018160," Like I don't want people misunderstanding us, misunderstanding her, confusing the two"
4018160,4020320," companies thinking they're affiliated.\""
4020320,4025960," And there was already some people that seemed genuinely confused."
4025960,4032240," So especially because they launched within the same week, like, or at least for announced"
4032240,4033240," within the same week."
4033240,4043760," So when a full-plane chat said, \"What about Lab 32 version 2 by 2?\""
4043760,4045520," Super speed, Lab 32."
4045520,4050160," That's pretty good."
4050160,4054040," I haven't heard any plans for anything different."
4054040,4061600," Do you have maybe no public thoughts on that, I'm assuming?"
4061600,4062600," Sorry, what was that?"
4062600,4065000," On a new name, other than Lab 32."
4065000,4067840," Because you're walking back the branding."
4067840,4070600," Do you have any that you're leaving towards, even privately?"
4070600,4071600," I don't."
4071600,4073040," Well, yeah, privately."
4073040,4077400," I feel like we could just go for..."
4077400,4080120," Man, I don't know."
4080120,4088640," I think privatelyltlabs.com, in my mind, is just kind of the obvious one at this point."
4088640,4089800," We tried."
4089800,4090800," We have it, right?"
4090800,4091800," Yeah."
4091800,4093480," Yeah, we tried to do something else."
4093480,4095360," And I think it just maybe give up."
4095360,4096720," We can run with it."
4096720,4099720," I think there's some people on the team that don't want to do that."
4099720,4105160," Oh, there's some people on the team that really don't want to do that."
4105160,4109120," But for better or for worse, it has a lot of brand equity."
4109120,4111080," We already own it."
4111080,4113640," It's easy."
4113640,4114640," It is easy."
4114640,4115880," And we do already own it."
4115880,4116880," And it is very..."
4116880,4122040," People will know that it's us working on it and it hits all those points and that's good."
4122040,4124040," But yeah."
4124040,4125840," Yeah."
4125840,4130440," There's another topic we can jump into."
4130440,4134080," Lab 64 wasn't available for those of you asking."
4134080,4135080," It's also really..."
4135080,4136080," Yeah."
4136080,4140640," And part of the beauty of Lab 32 is that it could be LTT if we ever decided to retcon"
4140640,4143480," the Linus Tech Tips, meaning of LTT?"
4143480,4144480," Lab 32."
4144480,4145480," Yeah."
4145480,4146480," Thanks for clarifying that."
4146480,4148800," Well, I think a lot of people didn't get that last time we talked about it."
4148800,4151880," You've mentioned that before and I think it whiffed like a ton of people."
4151880,4153400," So I'm trying to make it..."
4153400,4157320," Because I think the domain was numerical."
4157320,4158920," So I think people didn't put that together."
4158920,4159920," Right."
4159920,4160920," That makes sense."
4160920,4161920," Yeah."
4161920,4162920," All right."
4162920,4166800," Should we talk about Dbrand?"
4166800,4168600," Lab 69 also wasn't available."
4168600,4169600," We did check."
4169600,4170600," Yeah."
4170600,4171600," Yeah."
4171600,4172600," Let's talk about Dbrand."
4172600,4173600," That is insane."
4173600,4174600," 1000."
4174600,4175600," Yikes."
4175600,4176600," Bad situation."
4176600,4178520," Do you know about this?"
4178520,4181120," I didn't actually."
4181120,4185360," The magnet used to attach the kickstand to the rear of the kill switch case can affect"
4185360,4189120," the RPM of the internal fan of certain steam decks."
4189120,4190120," That's a problem."
4190120,4191120," Yeah."
4191120,4192120," That sucks."
4192120,4196360," Valve was initially shipping the steam deck with fans from two different..."
4196360,4200560," Awwww."
4200560,4201560," That sucks."
4201560,4203200," Okay."
4203200,4205480," So they were shipping the fans for two different suppliers."
4205480,4209360," So TLDR, I haven't even read it yet, but I'm sure it's going to go there."
4209360,4211960," One of the fans is not going to be affected by this."
4211960,4215760," And I'm sure this is the one that the Dbrand was working with, the Dbrand."
4215760,4218760," That Dbrand was working with and the other one is affected by it."
4218760,4222960," So yeah, it sounds like the delta version of the fans are affected by the magnet."
4222960,4224840," And then I have no idea how to pronounce this."
4224840,4225840," Wai-ing."
4225840,4226840," Wai-ing."
4226840,4227840," Wai-ing."
4227840,4228840," Probably."
4228840,4229840," I don't know."
4229840,4230840," Yeah."
4230840,4231840," Sure."
4231840,4232840," Those ones are not affected by the magnet."
4232840,4233840," Yeah."
4233840,4234840," And okay."
4234840,4235840," Yeah."
4235840,4240120," Steam decks used by Dbrand for testing all have the Wai-ing fans or however they pronounce."
4240120,4244920," Fan speeds dropped by 1500 to 2500 RPM."
4244920,4245920," That's a big problem."
4245920,4246920," That's a huge problem."
4246920,4248240," This is a mobile device."
4248240,4250440," You don't screw around with cooling for a mobile device."
4250440,4252080," Yeah, they usually pre dialed in."
4252080,4253080," It's not cool."
4253080,4254080," Yeah."
4254080,4255080," Yeah."
4255080,4256080," Yeah."
4256080,4263080," This fan behavior went unnoticed by other content creator/press outlets until the Verge"
4263080,4265240," were shipped a few kill switch cases."
4265240,4271080," Dbrand borrowed a delta fan equipped model from YouTuber, a really cool guy, Dave2D,"
4271080,4274240," and confirmed the findings by the Verge."
4274240,4278800," After confirming the issue, Dbrand made an 11th hour decision to suspend all kill switch"
4278800,4281160," sales per Dbrand."
4281160,4288120," Word on the grapevine is that Valve no longer uses the whiny delta fan in the production"
4288120,4292880," of Steam decks switching exclusively to the Wai-ing component, which is the one that isn't"
4292880,4293880," affected."
4293880,4297680," So that's good, I guess."
4297680,4298680," Yeah."
4298680,4299680," But they're still out there."
4299680,4300680," Yeah."
4300680,4301680," And we have no way of knowing."
4301680,4303720," We're going to know which one it is without taking it apart."
4303720,4304720," Yeah."
4304720,4307480," As cool as it is that you can do that."
4307480,4310600," Most users are not going to want to do that."
4310600,4314320," After confirming the issue, Dbrand made-- oh, yeah, yeah, I think I already said that."
4314320,4318280," But they're suspending all kill switch sales, which sucks."
4318280,4320880," Per Dbrand-- oh, I already talked about all this."
4320880,4321880," Where am I?"
4321880,4325000," The issue is limited to the magnetic kickstand."
4325000,4328960," The case itself travel cover stick grips and tempered glass game screen protectors do"
4328960,4331240," not cause any issues."
4331240,4333000," That we know of yet."
4333000,4334800," Yeah, yeah."
4334800,4335800," Probably not."
4335800,4336800," OK."
4336800,4337800," So maybe we'll see those separately or something."
4337800,4338800," I should be fine."
4338800,4339800," I should be fine."
4339800,4341560," There's no magnets in the other ones."
4341560,4343480," So it should be fine."
4343480,4344480," Yeah."
4344480,4351560," Oh, and unfortunately, because I thought the magnetic system was super cool."
4351560,4353640," Well, I don't think it's necessarily going away."
4353640,4354720," It is."
4354720,4360240," In response to this discovery, Dbrand is pivoting from the magnetic mount to a mechanical interlocking"
4360240,4363040," system for the kickstand and future accessories."
4363040,4367040," So what's going to happen is if you already ordered a magnetic version one, you're going"
4367040,4368200," to get that."
4368200,4371240," And then they're going to also send you a mechanical one."
4371240,4373400," Just in case you find it causes a problem with your system."
4373400,4377200," In case-- well, because that's the thing you might not notice, it causes a problem."
4377200,4379720," So they want people using the mechanical one."
4379720,4382440," Now, I, a savvy user--"
4382440,4383840," You can't part figure out."
4383840,4387760," --I'm going to open up my Steam Deck, make sure I've got a Waging fan."
4387760,4392920," And I'm going to use my magnetic one five ever."
4392920,4396760," But that's not going to help anyone else."
4396760,4402280," If you have a Delta one, you can buy a Steam Deck fan replacement from iFixit."
4402280,4403440," Yes, that's true."
4403440,4407680," I can't tell if this is Delta or Waging."
4407680,4412320," But considering they said they're going to stop working with Delta, it should be Waging."
4412320,4415880," So that's an option if it comes down to that."
4415880,4417080," Rough day for Dbrand."
4417080,4418080," Yeah, that sucks."
4418080,4422080," You don't want to go through all that product development and everything and have a problem"
4422080,4426680," like, oh, all the units that you had happened to have the fan that it would be fine with."
4426680,4428440," Like, that's so unfortunate."
4428440,4429440," That just sucks."
4429440,4430440," But--"
4430440,4433720," Whoa, we just got rated on Twitch."
4433720,4434720," Seven people showed up."
4434720,4435720," Nice."
4435720,4436720," Nice."
4436720,4437720," Thanks, David and Rose."
4437720,4438720," Thank you."
4438720,4439720," I don't know."
4439720,4442080," That rating is a weird thing to me."
4442080,4443080," Yeah."
4443080,4444080," But hey, thanks."
4444080,4445080," It can be cool."
4445080,4446080," Welcome, Raiders."
4446080,4447080," All seven of us."
4447080,4448080," Should we talk about--"
4448080,4449720," There's literally half dozen of us."
4449720,4452720," Should we talk about my absolutely thrilling night last night?"
4452720,4455120," Yeah, what are you talking about?"
4455120,4456760," He's been talking about this."
4456760,4460440," He's been beg posting all day about this."
4460440,4464000," I wanted to talk to you about it because it's very absurd."
4464000,4465000," And I know you'd laugh at me for it."
4465000,4466000," It would be a fun conversation."
4466000,4467000," Sure."
4467000,4470160," So I just decided that, hey, we don't always get to talk that often, but as well just do"
4470160,4471160," it on Wancho."
4471160,4472160," I guess so."
4472160,4473160," So--"
4473160,4474160," So--"
4474160,4475920," I mean, we talked a lot like yesterday, but sure."
4475920,4476920," That's probably true."
4476920,4477920," Wait, yesterday?"
4477920,4478920," No, yeah."
4478920,4479920," Because I was going to say I would have talked to you about this."
4479920,4482720," Yeah, we talked for like two hours on Wednesday, but yeah, we don't talk."
4482720,4483720," This hadn't happened yet."
4483720,4484720," Yeah, whatever."
4484720,4485720," This hadn't happened yet."
4485720,4488720," Yeah, sure."
4488720,4495680," So I was wandering around various parks with a gigantic bird cage playing bird noises from"
4495680,4500200," my phone trying to not look crazy."
4500200,4501800," You lost your birds?"
4501800,4506080," So I'm smiling because no, it wasn't ours."
4506080,4508040," But someone else did."
4508040,4509560," Aww."
4509560,4510560," So we were trying to--"
4510560,4511560," Aww."
4511560,4514520," Emma, my girlfriend, her name's public, it's fine."
4514520,4517040," Emma found-- she was walking around a park for funsies."
4517040,4518800," Since when is her name public?"
4518800,4520680," Oh, yeah, I guess she streams."
4520680,4522800," I mean, I just try to call it plenty time."
4522800,4523800," Yeah, yeah."
4523800,4527920," I mean, I usually try to do that for people that I'm not 100% sure of, but I'm sure of"
4527920,4528920," her."
4528920,4536600," She found a little posted little sign thing begging for help in a park and was like, we"
4536600,4538320," kind of know how to do this."
4538320,4541480," So she was going at it pretty hard and eventually convinced me to come help."
4541480,4547960," And the strategy, which does actually kind of work, is that you walk around with a cage"
4547960,4555200," because a lot of house tamed birds understand that cage usually means water, food, and safety."
4555200,4556600," Right, OK."
4556600,4561920," And you play bird noises because budgies are like super, super flock animals."
4561920,4565320," And the second they hear a chirping, they chirp back and then they want to come join"
4565320,4566480," it."
4566480,4569120," So it'll like get them to come to you."
4569120,4573320," And then when they get to you, they see like, oh, cage and food and water."
4573320,4575200," And this is that thing that I used to go into."
4575200,4576800," And when I would go into it, things were good."
4576800,4579560," So it's very likely that they'll actually go inside."
4579560,4580560," Right."
4580560,4583240," Also, there had been some sightings of the bird, not by us."
4583240,4587160," And it was trying to socialize with people and the people would like take a picture of"
4587160,4588680," it and then walk away."
4588680,4591600," Budgies are not native to BC."
4591600,4595080," If that happens, try to get it because it is someone's bird."
4595080,4596160," And it will die."
4596160,4597160," And it will die."
4597160,4598160," Yeah."
4598160,4606200," Like it's it was very scary for the actually days that it was very surprises for that long."
4606200,4609440," We unfortunately weren't the ones that ended up finding it."
4609440,4610440," Someone else did."
4610440,4611440," But it got found."
4611440,4612640," Another bird owner found it."
4612640,4613640," Oh, wow."
4613640,4618000," But yeah, it got found because again, it wants to be."
4618000,4620840," It was going up to people being like, hey, help me."
4620840,4621840," There's pictures."
4621840,4627040," There's a picture online of it sitting on a jungle gym next to some kid trying to be"
4627040,4629600," like, hey, and you can tell from the body language."
4629600,4634160," If you know birds, you can tell from the body language, it's like, pay attention to me."
4634160,4635160," Hello."
4635160,4640200," And there's other pictures of it like sitting on a on a park bench next to people just like"
4640200,4642320," on the park bench amongst people."
4642320,4647840," Like it was clearly comfortable with people and trying to get help and people just kept"
4647840,4649080," taking pictures of it."
4649080,4650280," Obviously a pet."
4650280,4651760," Yeah."
4651760,4655120," Which was crazy to me, but I don't know."
4655120,4662160," But yeah, the person the person that found it had birds, but was not a part of the actual"
4662160,4663160," rescue operation."
4663160,4666000," They just like happened to find it."
4666000,4670040," And he's my our concern right now is that no one knows who the actual"
4670040,4671040," owner is."
4671040,4674200," It was just a bunch of people reporting like this is clearly someone's bird."
4674200,4675560," Oh, so we don't know."
4675560,4676560," Don't know who the owner."
4676560,4677560," Yeah."
4677560,4679880," Oh, I might have said that oddly at the beginning, but yeah, we thought you were helping the"
4679880,4680880," owner."
4680880,4687240," So the report, I guess you were, but the report was that someone had seen the social posts"
4687240,4692360," and immediately clued in that it was someone's bird, but it wasn't their bird, but they"
4692360,4696440," were like, we should try to help this whoever this bird this is."
4696440,4702520," So the person that has it doesn't really want to like bring it to a vet and stuff and it's"
4702520,4705720," like being all weird about it and kind of wants to keep it."
4705720,4709400," But there's nothing that like we can do about it."
4709400,4714600," So it was a weird night, but there's like a halfway happy ending."
4714600,4719000," It's no longer outdoors where it has a huge chance of not surviving."
4719000,4720000," Right."
4720000,4721000," So that's good."
4721000,4724040," Now it's indoors where it also has a huge chance of not surviving because it's a bunchy."
4724040,4725040," There."
4725040,4726040," Yep."
4726040,4727920," Luke's had some bad luck."
4727920,4734240," It's yeah, it's been better lately, but birds are very fragile, especially really tiny birds."
4734240,4735960," They get sick very quickly."
4735960,4736960," They're flock animals."
4736960,4738400," They don't want the flock to abandon them."
4738400,4743360," So they try to hide their sickness and they don't exactly have a lot of mass."
4743360,4748000," So they they tend to die very quickly."
4748000,4749000," Does a bird have microchips?"
4749000,4750000," I don't know."
4750000,4751000," We were the ones that caught it."
4751000,4752000," I don't think so."
4752000,4753400," Can you microchip a bird?"
4753400,4756320," Actually, you put a little band around its foot."
4756320,4757320," Yeah."
4757320,4758560," Microchips are a very different thing."
4758560,4759640," It's like an injection."
4759640,4760640," I knew what they meant."
4760640,4761640," Yeah."
4761640,4762640," Someone else said, is it banded?"
4762640,4763640," Yeah."
4763640,4766920," So I don't I don't if who from the pictures, I don't remember."
4766920,4770640," I don't think it was though."
4770640,4772000," But yeah, that was that was interesting."
4772000,4777160," I was talking to my girlfriend afterwards and she was talking about how when she's walking"
4777160,4779360," because she's doing the same thing, she took the small cage."
4779360,4780360," I had a really big one."
4780360,4782760," My hands were very unhappy by the end of it."
4782760,4783760," Yeah."
4783760,4786320," Because it's just this like wire that I have to hold the cage on."
4786320,4791920," But she's walking around playing budgie noises and holding this cage and a bunch of people"
4791920,4795120," apparently were like, talking, you're like, Oh, what are you doing?"
4795120,4796120," Whatever."
4796120,4799920," No one talked to me."
4799920,4801320," Not a single person."
4801320,4806920," I had a lot of people that were like jogging and they just got a lot of pretty privilege."
4806920,4807920," Yeah."
4807920,4810480," Look it up."
4810480,4811720," It's a thing."
4811720,4815160," Just people with like a void eye contact."
4815160,4817800," They'd run by."
4817800,4821360," I had one one old dude who's going for a walk."
4821360,4825960," I walked by him and he's like on in the middle of the track and he's like walking with the"
4825960,4826960," cane and stuff."
4826960,4831000," So I go off the track and walk in the grass just so he has an easy time."
4831000,4835440," And I noticed I can just tell that he has completely stopped and turned around and just"
4835440,4838200," stared at me as I walk away."
4838200,4842240," I've seen a lot of things in my life, but I never seen that before."
4842240,4846920," The amount of kids that would like hear the bird sound, see that I'm holding a cage and"
4846920,4850760," like get kind of excited and look at the cage and then realize there's no bird and just"
4850760,4854080," look at me really confused and like what's happening."
4854080,4855080," Yeah."
4855080,4858520," You have a new nickname and float plane chat by the way, local nutter Luke."
4858520,4859520," Yeah."
4859520,4865600," I mean, probably I was trying to help."
4865600,4866600," Okay."
4866600,4867600," Oh man."
4867600,4873720," Yeah, we went to like, there's a lot of little parks around that area and the rescue group"
4873720,4878640," had like tracked the movements and stuff."
4878640,4882040," So we were trying to figure out like where he would probably be next."
4882040,4883040," Yeah."
4883040,4889720," It's amazing how the difference between nice helper and terrifying person is like a Y chromosome"
4889720,4891760," and like 75 pounds."
4891760,4892760," Yeah."
4892760,4893760," Yeah."
4893760,4898760," Yeah."
4898760,4904840," Anyway, should we talk about, do you want to talk about rising 7,000 versus 13th gen?"
4904840,4906520," Do you want to talk about the fight?"
4906520,4907720," Let's talk about the fight."
4907720,4908720," Let's talk about the fight."
4908720,4910360," Actually, no, we just did a non tech topic."
4910360,4911360," Let's talk about the rise."
4911360,4912360," Let's do a tech topic."
4912360,4913360," Yeah."
4913360,4914360," Yeah."
4914360,4915360," All right."
4915360,4917400," General consensus on rising 7,000."
4917400,4922360," These are some incredible chips that are bringing massive gains like 20 to 30% improvements"
4922360,4925920," over their last gen counterparts in gaming and productivity."
4925920,4931760," The 7950X is undoubtedly the fastest mainstream CPU available and dominates everyone in productivity"
4931760,4932760," tasks."
4932760,4939960," But the expense of the platform is a real issue."
4939960,4940960," Is this AMD?"
4940960,4941960," I'm talking about it."
4941960,4942960," Yeah, that's weird."
4942960,4943960," Where's this Intel?"
4943960,4948760," You don't think like insanely the so my understanding is yeah, the boards are like $500"
4948760,4949760," each."
4949760,4950760," Yep."
4950760,4951760," That's crazy."
4951760,4955320," The prices that are lower now that was just right at launch."
4955320,4962200," We're seeing as low as 250 bucks for an AsRock X670PG, X670PG Lightning."
4962200,4970160," But AM5 only supports DDR5, which remains twice as expensive per gig as comparable DDR4."
4970160,4975880," And the other issue as we outlined in our review is that AMD's own rise in 750, 100X3D has"
4975880,4982400," gaming performance that matches that of the new 7700X and only legs behind the rise in"
4982400,4985720," nines by like a couple of percent on average."
4985720,4993000," So for gamers, the upgrade to AM5 is currently not looking like a great value, especially"
4993000,4998240," because AM4 boards and chips are cheap and cheerful."
4998240,5002560," And here's the thing, you can look at AM4 and you can go, well, there's no upgrade path."
5002560,5009200," And that's nice, but not everybody can actually afford the latest generation version of the"
5009200,5010360," AM4 platform."
5010360,5014200," I have never been super sold on on board upgrade paths."
5014200,5020760," What if you are buying a rise in 2000 today because you want to like get a deal?"
5020760,5021760," Okay."
5021760,5027960," AM4 for you has an upgrade path a couple of years from now, three years from now."
5027960,5028960," Boom."
5028960,5035040," You go rise in 5000 with that same board, you just got a big upgrade and probably for"
5035040,5036040," cheap."
5036040,5037040," Yeah."
5037040,5038040," Right."
5038040,5043160," So you got to think not everybody is thinking in terms of brand new today."
5043160,5044160," Yeah."
5044160,5049880," And especially these days, we're like, okay, the performance jumps for seeing on some of"
5049880,5052840," the hardware that's coming out is immense."
5052840,5055480," Like actually just huge."
5055480,5061400," But the performance that people need at the same time to reach like competitive frame"
5061400,5065640," rates and stuff is not huge and it's not increasing at anywhere near the same rate."
5065640,5069240," So the gap between people's computer upgrades is getting like bigger and bigger and bigger"
5069240,5070480," as far as I can tell."
5070480,5075200," So you don't necessarily need to upgrade your CPU within generation every single time."
5075200,5079960," But you definitely don't want to upgrade at all if the other boards minimum cost is"
5079960,5085920," $500, which again, it's gone down, but still that's really intense."
5085920,5090520," When we looked at productivity, the 7,600X and 7,700X were another issue."
5090520,5097200," They don't really offer compelling performance over Intel's 12th gen mainstream chips, although"
5097200,5098560," they're higher core counts."
5098560,5103760," Oh, though the higher core counts on the 7,900X and 7950X allow them to run away with the"
5103760,5105160," productivity crown."
5105160,5112160," But that's an issue."
5112160,5117760," Has AMD done it again?"
5117760,5141240," Even concerns expressed by the community around how hot these chips get."
5141240,5164760," Well, here's the thing."
5164760,5170480," The 3,300-watt chip that is running at 70 degrees with liquid cooling on it and it is"
5170480,5178640," still kicking 300 watts into your room, it's just not running hot if you guys kind of understand"
5178640,5179640," what I mean."
5179640,5181520," Conservation of energy, all right?"
5181520,5184680," It doesn't matter what temperature it's at."
5184680,5192240," It matters how much actual power it is consuming and therefore thermal energy is outputting."
5192240,5196520," In terms of maintaining room temperatures."
5196520,5198400," Der Bauer did some stuff with that as well."
5198400,5199400," Is that in here?"
5199400,5201400," Yeah, he deleted the 7,900X."
5201400,5206080," He dropped like I think it was like 20 degrees or something."
5206080,5210200," So there is some speculation that AMD may have sacrificed thermal performance to maintain"
5210200,5214040," cooler compatibility with AM4 coolers, in which case good guy AMD, but I haven't seen"
5214040,5218640," any confirmation of that."
5218640,5222040," What we didn't touch on in our review, performance scaling with RAM speeds."
5222040,5223040," And we'll have to follow that up."
5223040,5226960," I was going to say that was kind of interesting to me and immediately made me think like,"
5226960,5228680," okay, there's going to be another video."
5228680,5233960," Eco mode, a lower power consumption mode for the CPU and manual overclocking."
5233960,5239840," Now in the same week, actually the next day Intel didn't launch but announced their 13th"
5239840,5245640," gen processors with most of the details really being around the flagship 13,900K."
5245640,5250320," 5.8 GHz turbo, 24 cores."
5250320,5255680," Now 16 of those are efficiency or e-course and only eight of them are their performance"
5255680,5262240," course, but 24 cores and their e-course aren't that slow."
5262240,5263760," They're like Skylake level."
5263760,5269520," Like they're not bad and $589."
5269520,5270960," The presentation was kind of fun."
5270960,5275880," 24% performance improvement in games, some games, one game."
5275880,5277440," It was League of Legends."
5277440,5278440," I think it was League of Legends."
5278440,5279440," I didn't know it was one game."
5279440,5280440," It was like League of Legends or Dota or something like that."
5280440,5282840," I thought it was going to be like two or three at least."
5282840,5286640," 34% faster in game development, Blender UE5."
5286640,5290760," The Core i5 and Core i7 see similar but lesser improvements to speed, cache size and core"
5290760,5291760," count."
5291760,5297560," And the real winner is efficiency gains, okay, Intel alleges that at 65 watts, the 13,900K"
5297560,5303080," so they also I guess might have like a similar Eco mode, performs on par with a 12,900K"
5303080,5306040," at 241 watts in a multi-threaded workload."
5306040,5309120," That's a quarter of the power consumption if that holds true."
5309120,5315000," The big one though is that Intel is going to have the affordable platform."
5315000,5320880," You can pick up a 13th gen chip, a Z690 board rather than 790 because 790 only adds some"
5320880,5322920," more gen 4 lanes in USB bandwidth."
5322920,5325440," You can get a last gen board or a B660 board."
5325440,5326440," Doesn't matter."
5326440,5331080," As long as it's got a good enough VRM, you get some DDR4 memory."
5331080,5335680," You throw this 13th gen chip on there and to be clear, we are going to check this out"
5335680,5336680," for you guys."
5336680,5346040," We are going to make sure that with DDR4 it actually performs well."
5346040,5349920," And you're going to be able, you're going to have like a latest gen platform for literally"
5349920,5351720," hundreds of dollars less."
5351720,5354680," I don't necessarily think the motherboard thing is going to stay the same though."
5354680,5360360," If we've already seen the availability pop up with boards that are half the price of"
5360360,5362320," what we were originally talking about."
5362320,5363320," No, okay."
5363320,5365280," So no, AMD's boards will come down."
5365280,5369640," The boards will come down, but they haven't launched their budget chipset yet."
5369640,5375440," And for 13th gen, neither has Intel, but because you're able to use a last gen board"
5375440,5378960," and all you're missing out on is some PCI E lanes on the, on the self bridge."
5378960,5381680," I don't know what they call it anymore, but whatever the motherboard chips that I know"
5381680,5387440," hub because you're just missing out on some PCI E lanes and USB ports for gamers."
5387440,5389280," You're not giving up anything."
5389280,5393000," You go for your last gen board with the cheapo mainstream chipset."
5393000,5396120," You put your latest gen chip, you put your last gen memory."
5396120,5397120," That's another thing."
5397120,5398120," DDR5."
5398120,5401400," Yeah, it's going to come down in price, but it sure as heck isn't today."
5401400,5403840," And you might be building a system today."
5403840,5408480," Now this is the kind of competition I love to see because it's going to be back and forth"
5408480,5410600," for 14th gen, right?"
5410600,5416560," Intel's probably going to do their thing where a socket, socket compatibility is only maintained"
5416560,5418080," for two generations."
5418080,5421840," So it'll be a whole new platform with whole new expensive boards."
5421840,5422840," Right?"
5422840,5427840," Meanwhile, AMD is going to have budget like B seven, six year, I forget what their budget"
5427840,5430000," boards are going to be called for this new platform."
5430000,5432560," Six something anyway, whatever, they're going to have new boards."
5432560,5435680," DDR5 might be closer to price parity by that point."
5435680,5439040," And AMD is all of a sudden going to look like the good bet."
5439040,5440040," But I love it."
5440040,5441840," It's back and forth."
5441840,5443360," It's punches."
5443360,5447360," You know, I just, I love seeing them duke it out."
5447360,5448360," I love."
5448360,5449360," Okay."
5449360,5453000," They want competition, but they don't really want competition."
5453000,5458300," They want someone to make a product that's like good enough to keep the brand that they"
5458300,5461520," like honest and they're just going to buy that brand no matter what that other company"
5461520,5462680," comes out with."
5462680,5464160," But this is true competition."
5464160,5467120," This is, this is two real options."
5467120,5468320," Yeah, that's cool."
5468320,5475040," Not just something that's like good enough that the monopolist can't price it at whatever"
5475040,5476960," they want."
5476960,5478480," I am, I'm stoked."
5478480,5483160," I think the brand wars are going to cook up because of that because for the last little"
5483160,5486360," while it's just been like buy AMD buy MD buy MD."
5486360,5490040," But now that there's hopefully good arguments, both ways, depending on like specifically"
5490040,5493880," what you're doing, all the kind of stuff should make things a little bit more interesting."
5493880,5497360," And I mean, you've got mid cycle refreshes men."
5497360,5499640," Mid cycle refreshes are a thing now."
5499640,5502840," AMD's already talking about adding 3dV cash."
5502840,5508040," Well already teased a KS version of this chip at over 5 GHz or 6 rather."
5508040,5510480," Ah, that's exciting."
5510480,5511480," It's exciting."
5511480,5512480," Yeah, it's good."
5512480,5514880," You want to talk about the fight?"
5514880,5515880," Yes."
5515880,5517120," Spoiler alert."
5517120,5521640," If you haven't seen the latest channel Super Fun, we will be talking about the result of"
5521640,5528400," the epic, epic battle between me and Dennis."
5528400,5537600," For context, again, it's so tedious seeing my words and actions taken in the worst possible"
5537600,5538760," light."
5538760,5547520," So for context, no, I did not require Dennis to fight me so that I could prove my manhood"
5547520,5548520," or something."
5548520,5551600," I don't know what you're talking about."
5551600,5556200," Dennis challenged me to a fight."
5556200,5562200," And what he told me was that he was sick of hearing me complain about my scratched floor."
5562200,5566320," So if he won, I could never talk about it again."
5566320,5569800," And obviously, this was for content."
5569800,5571560," He thought it was a really good video concept."
5571560,5573840," I agreed, so we greenlit it."
5573840,5579360," And the challenge was that Dennis was going to be allowed some amount of time to train."
5579360,5580480," It was not a lot of time."
5580480,5582600," It was not like a normal amount of time for a fight."
5582600,5585600," Yeah, like I think it was like a couple weeks or something like that."
5585600,5587200," Yeah, like actually too."
5587200,5588200," Yeah."
5588200,5589760," Well, he had more time than that."
5589760,5591560," He could have trained, but he wasn't filming."
5591560,5593280," A lot of fights are like months out."
5593280,5594280," Oh, oh, yeah."
5594280,5598800," I mean, I remember being blown away because I didn't realize how demanding it is when"
5598800,5601440," I found out that top fighters would fight once a year."
5601440,5602440," Yeah."
5602440,5603440," I was like, oh, OK."
5603440,5606360," Yeah, well, and they train specifically for that fight."
5606360,5607680," Sometimes they're moving weight classes."
5607680,5609360," Like there's a lot of things involved with it."
5609360,5613880," However, I will say this, Dennis trained a lot more than me, which was zero."
5613880,5616200," I help out in my girls class."
5616200,5617200," OK, yeah."
5617200,5619920," I was going to ask about that because we had talked and you said that you didn't train"
5619920,5620920," anymore."
5620920,5621920," No."
5621920,5623400," And then when I watched the video, there was footage of you there."
5623400,5624400," Yeah."
5624400,5627640," But like you looked a little rigid and like you weren't really training."
5627640,5629720," So I was wondering like, were you doing a demonstration?"
5629720,5630720," Yeah."
5630720,5631720," Yeah, OK."
5631720,5636040," Yeah, I was I'm there to be like a like a black belt helper in the class."
5636040,5637040," That's cool."
5637040,5639840," And like I go around and help correct form and stuff like that."
5639840,5642320," Like I don't remember any of my patterns or anything like that."
5642320,5644720," So I'm like, but you can see when something's like obviously wrong."
5644720,5645720," Yeah."
5645720,5650560," And like if the if the if the masters like, yeah, can you help them with with this?"
5650560,5652880," Like, how's that go again?"
5652880,5653880," Yeah."
5653880,5654880," Yeah, yeah, no problem."
5654880,5655880," Got it."
5655880,5658320," Like I can immediately pick things up again because it's all stuff I've done before."
5658320,5659640," It's just for 20 years, right?"
5659640,5660640," Yeah."
5660640,5661640," Yeah."
5661640,5662640," So that's what I that's what I was doing."
5662640,5666400," I'm not actually like training or anything like that."
5666400,5670480," So the challenge was Dennis would get a couple of weeks to train."
5670480,5672680," And I would be going in cold."
5672680,5673680," Yeah."
5673680,5674680," Hold on."
5674680,5675680," You're making that face."
5675680,5678000," But Dennis has as much martial arts training as I do."
5678000,5682720," No, I made that face as a black belt because I was reminded of the fact that he's doing"
5682720,5685920," so this was this was a specifically Taekwondo fight."
5685920,5686920," Yes."
5686920,5688720," And he went you went to a crop McGah."
5688720,5690520," Well, I don't know."
5690520,5694600," Look, he didn't ask me for advice on how you should train."
5694600,5698080," So like, yeah, he spent two weeks training."
5698080,5701080," He also did some weird stuff in that."
5701080,5704680," Like, I mean, crop McGah is super cool, but like what?"
5704680,5705680," Okay."
5705680,5706680," Not for this."
5706680,5711200," I think there are other ways he could have done it, but I do understand why he did it."
5711200,5712200," Why he did crop McGah."
5712200,5713200," Why?"
5713200,5714200," Okay."
5714200,5716640," The reason he did that is because Dennis is biggest problem is that all you have to do"
5716640,5717640," is move fast near him."
5717640,5718640," Yeah, for your thing."
5718640,5720040," And you're like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
5720040,5721200," You're like flinches, right?"
5721200,5722200," Yeah."
5722200,5723200," He's a flinchy boy."
5723200,5728040," And so you actually saw that in the beginning of the video when I was laughing at him."
5728040,5732160," Because I was like, as basically I've been teasing him off camera as well."
5732160,5735080," I'm like, dude, you don't have a chance because all I have to do is go like that."
5735080,5736080," Oh, yeah, you did that."
5736080,5737080," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
5737080,5738680," And it worked, right?"
5738680,5740360," And he was like, you can't do that."
5740360,5744560," He was trying not to flinch because I had already been doing that to him for like a week."
5744560,5746560," Like every time I saw him, I'd be like, yeah, Dennis."
5746560,5748840," That actually makes a lot more sense."
5748840,5749840," Yes."
5749840,5754080," Because I haven't watched the whole video yet, but he, he, the crop McGah guy is like, okay,"
5754080,5758240," we got to do this because you need to like drop your nerves and like be able to be more"
5758240,5760200," calm and so that was the whole goal."
5760200,5761200," Okay."
5761200,5762200," Exactly."
5762200,5769040," So he was trying to be less twitchy and, and less like freak outy whenever something."
5769040,5776880," I will say at the fight, maybe that actually really worked because he didn't do that like"
5776880,5777880," at all."
5777880,5778880," Really."
5778880,5786040," He moves that were very derpy, like keeping his arms down like this and other stuff like"
5786040,5787040," that."
5787040,5788040," Okay."
5788040,5789040," So we should talk, we should talk about the fight."
5789040,5790040," Yeah."
5790040,5792640," Man, dude, this is, this is the kind of stuff I'm talking about."
5792640,5795000," Uh, oh yeah, I lost because I didn't train."
5795000,5796000," Yeah, yeah."
5796000,5797000," I didn't lose."
5797000,5798000," Yeah."
5798000,5799560," Have you watched the video?"
5799560,5802320," Why do you even watch this show?"
5802320,5806640," Like if you're actually just going to, if you're going to take everything I do and say"
5806640,5810600," in the worst possible way, you must hate me, right?"
5810600,5813240," Because everything I do is awful."
5813240,5814240," Um, okay."
5814240,5815240," Stop reading yet."
5815240,5816240," Yeah."
5816240,5818760," So let's talk, so let's talk about the fight."
5818760,5822280," First of all, I want to say massive respect to Dennis."
5822280,5823280," Yeah."
5823280,5825640," He did way better than I expected."
5825640,5826640," Oh yeah."
5826640,5827640," Dan, did you watch it?"
5827640,5828640," Have you watched the video?"
5828640,5829640," No, I haven't seen it yet."
5829640,5830640," You haven't seen it?"
5830640,5831640," No."
5831640,5832640," You should watch it."
5832640,5833640," It's really good."
5833640,5837760," Dennis put up a way, way better fight than I expected."
5837760,5839720," And B, it's a really good video."
5839720,5840720," Yeah."
5840720,5845800," The, the, the, like the training and the behind the scenes, uh, you guys, I, I'm not going"
5845800,5853040," to spoil everything, but Dennis put some serious thought and energy into both giving himself"
5853040,5858160," his best chance possible and sabotaging me in the most underhanded ways possible."
5858160,5859160," So funny."
5859160,5860800," I heard about that without me realizing."
5860800,5861800," Oh, funny."
5861800,5863800," Not at all."
5863800,5874640," Um, however, I wasn't super thrilled with how the rules of the phone, not at all, the"
5874640,5877240," format of the fight, I hated it played out."
5877240,5878240," Yeah."
5878240,5884160," Um, I would say that a lot of people were confused about the scoring."
5884160,5890680," So for one thing, I will say that the scoring was not actually as abhorrent as it appeared"
5890680,5892600," to be in the video."
5892600,5896600," It the way, the way that it works and Dennis only flashed up like the scoring system for"
5896600,5901080," a second before taking it away, which I guess kind of makes sense in keeping the videos"
5901080,5905640," pacing, moving quickly, but might not make sense in terms of people understanding what"
5905640,5906640," they're watching."
5906640,5912560," The way the scoring worked was that a strike to the body to the front or the side, I think"
5912560,5919160," is one point with the hands, a strike to the body front or side with the legs is two points."
5919160,5923680," Um, a takedown to getting the other opponent's shoulders on the ground."
5923680,5925040," That's two points."
5925040,5929240," And then I think it was a spinning, a kick to the head is either three or four."
5929240,5932120," And then a spinning kick to the head is like five or something."
5932120,5933120," Oh, right."
5933120,5934120," Yeah."
5934120,5935120," It's a lot."
5935120,5938160," And the reason for that is not because a spinning kick to the head is actually practical"
5938160,5940280," in a real world fighter flight."
5940280,5948200," I choose fight scenario, but because it is slow and so it demonstrates a clear reading"
5948200,5953760," of where your opponent will be and a quickness in your execution that is desirable in this"
5953760,5955560," particular form of sparring."
5955560,5956560," We weren't fighting."
5956560,5957720," We were sparring."
5957720,5959080," So it's a points based system."
5959080,5960080," Yeah."
5960080,5965080," And a lot of it's like showing off technical ability and stuff more than, uh, be able to"
5965080,5967680," strike very hard and like knock your opponent out or anything."
5967680,5974920," We also played more like, um, like training or like, uh, like, like, like kid or teenager"
5974920,5980600," rules in that we didn't allow like type one, go mix martial arts, allows takedowns and"
5980600,5985880," allows strikes to the face, but we played with take downs, but without strikes to the"
5985880,5986880," face."
5986880,5987880," Yeah."
5987880,5991880," Side and top of head were allowed, I believe you can kick to the head, but you were not"
5991880,5995240," allowed to strike with your hands to the head at all."
5995240,5996240," Okay."
5996240,5997240," Okay."
5997240,5998240," Okay."
5998240,5999240," So what happened?"
5999240,6001400," There were some definite like referee."
6001400,6003960," I wish the call had gone a different way moments."
6003960,6009000," Uh, there's, there's this part where I clearly catches leg and from on the ground and he"
6009000,6013560," gets two points for the kick for the kick that never actually hit me."
6013560,6014760," That was a little frustrating."
6014760,6019600," Uh, I also, okay, Dennis, this is going to be a controversial take."
6019600,6024920," I don't think he deserved the points he got for that head kick."
6024920,6027000," That was not a kick."
6027000,6033280," Even in the footage, it looks like he like moved my head with his leg."
6033280,6042360," But if you go back and watch slowly, I'm actually moving and his leg grazes my head."
6042360,6046880," I was going to say, because in person, it seemed less legit than when I watched it in"
6046880,6051240," video and in video, because the cameras on the other side of the room, it seemed more"
6051240,6052240," legit."
6052240,6056880," I think, I think Dennis being the editor of the video might have picked the most favorable"
6056880,6060960," angle for that kick to the head."
6060960,6065560," Um, however, that wasn't the biggest problem."
6065560,6066560," All right."
6066560,6067560," I, I, okay."
6067560,6068560," Actually, you know what?"
6068560,6069920," I, I'm talking about it a lot."
6069920,6071560," What did you think?"
6071560,6072560," Uh, sorry."
6072560,6075080," Once I got to send this message."
6075080,6077480," Oh, I'm asking about a technical thing."
6077480,6082680," Um, I was a little annoyed by a few things."
6082680,6085960," Justin, Justin, how it was, the fight was very fun to watch."
6085960,6086960," Yeah."
6086960,6087960," The event was very entertaining to be that."
6087960,6088960," Yeah."
6088960,6089960," I had fun."
6089960,6094880," Um, something that is mentioned in the video, like multiple times, but was like painful"
6094880,6095880," in person."
6095880,6097800," Like it was definitely covered in the video."
6097800,6098880," It was covered enough."
6098880,6100720," It didn't need to be covered more."
6100720,6105000," But the breaks between rounds were actually crazy."
6105000,6108560," Like the breaks between rounds were longer than the rounds were."
6108560,6112640," Um, and I know Linus actually defends Dennis on this because Linus is like, I was tired"
6112640,6113640," too."
6113640,6118560," But like none of this made into the video, but there's, I guarantee there's footage"
6118560,6122080," of me just like yelling at Dennis to start fighting."
6122080,6123840," And I want Dennis inside."
6123840,6129240," And there's, there's one part when the, when the ref starts counting for him to like get"
6129240,6132920," up because he'd be de-cued if he got to."
6132920,6137560," I think it was like 10, which is a long time to count for."
6137560,6142160," But he should have been, he should have started that counting way earlier because he'd let"
6142160,6146160," him sit there for like, oh, maybe it was less than this."
6146160,6147560," It felt like 30 seconds."
6147560,6148560," Like on the ground."
6148560,6149560," Yeah."
6149560,6153560," Like not like standing, like sitting on the ground."
6153560,6154560," Yeah."
6154560,6156080," And like this is, this is not necessary."
6156080,6157200," I might have said it wrong."
6157200,6158840," This is not time between rounds."
6158840,6163960," This was after a stoppage during a round where they're just resetting to go again because"
6163960,6167520," like someone went out of the circle or a point with scored or whatever."
6167520,6171480," Um, so Dennis's cardio is even worse than it shows in the video."
6171480,6172480," By a lot."
6172480,6173480," A lot."
6173480,6181280," Like you didn't, you didn't see a huge portion of the stoppages where we're all just standing"
6181280,6183160," there waiting for Dennis."
6183160,6187560," And then he comes out of those stoppages just flying all over the place."
6187560,6188560," Tons of energy."
6188560,6192400," I had forgotten about this after he scored some point, he does a cartwheel."
6192400,6193960," Like he's totally into it."
6193960,6196640," And then there's a stoppage and he's like, nope."
6196640,6197640," Yeah."
6197640,6198640," Pretty much."
6198640,6203640," Which I mean, with the amount of cardio that he has and how tired that he was, the ability"
6203640,6208400," to pull it together and push through the tiredness and do some of the stuff that he did."
6208400,6209400," Good."
6209400,6213680," One of the other things though, yeah, is that as he got tired and this happens as you get"
6213680,6217360," tired, your hands start to kind of droop."
6217360,6220320," And any of your trainers are going to yell at you for them to come back up."
6220320,6224520," But, uh, he didn't exactly have a corner man."
6224520,6227360," So his hands are drooping hands are drooping hands are drooping hands are drooping hands"
6227360,6228840," are drooping hands are drooping hands are drooping hands are drooping hands are drooping"
6228840,6229840," hands are drooping hands are drooping hands are drooping hands are drooping hands are"
6229840,6230840," drooping hands are drooping hands are drooping hands are drooping hands are drooping"
6230840,6231840," hands are drooping hands are drooping hands are drooping hands are drooping hands"
6231840,6233640," are drooping hands are drooping hands are drooping hands are drooping hands are"
6233640,6234640," drooping hands are drooping hands are drooping hands are drooping hands are drooping"
6234640,6236640," hands are drooping hands are drooping hands are drooping hands are drooping hands are"
6236640,6237640," and that's my biggest problem."
6237640,6238640," Yeah."
6238640,6239640," Yeah."
6239640,6240640," Yeah."
6240640,6241640," Yeah."
6241640,6242640," Yeah."
6242640,6243640," Yeah."
6243640,6244640," Yeah."
6244640,6245640," Yeah."
6245640,6246640," Yeah."
6246640,6247640," Is that a combination of Dennis's tiredness and the format of the fight led to Dennis basically"
6247640,6248640," basically fighting like this."
6248640,6249640," Yeah."
6249640,6250640," That doesn't count."
6250640,6251640," Yeah."
6251640,6252640," Right."
6252640,6258440," So if he's standing like this and the rules are that you have to get a clean hit, I pretty"
6258440,6261600," much had nothing to strike at."
6261600,6263200," The only place is middle."
6263200,6266440," So he, he said, what did he say?"
6266440,6270720," Coward move or something like that because I kept going for leg grabs and takedowns."
6270720,6273720," He was like, yeah, leg pulls are a coward move or something like that."
6273720,6274720," Something like that."
6274720,6281680," Because you're volunteering to receive a strike, but whatever."
6281680,6288680," And, and, and he's, but he was standing like this with his arms in front of his body."
6288680,6293400," When what I wanted to do was just punch him in the face then because his hands are down,"
6293400,6295400," which is what a lot of people's reaction is going to be."
6295400,6297880," But that chicken move, he called it a chicken move."
6297880,6298880," Chicken move."
6298880,6299880," Okay."
6299880,6300880," Yeah."
6300880,6301880," Yeah."
6301880,6303880," But that, that would be against the rules because you're not allowed to strike to the"
6303880,6308840," both of us, just like the adrenaline was flowing and got demerits actually."
6308840,6315560," We lost points for striking the other one in the face at some point or another with,"
6315560,6316920," with our hands."
6316920,6323840," But I think that, I think that I could have maintained my guard a fair bit better."
6323840,6328760," And so, so then it's actually already challenged me to a rematch."
6328760,6329760," And I."
6329760,6330760," It needs to be way further out."
6330760,6331760," I have accepted."
6331760,6332760," Oh, 100%."
6332760,6333760," Yeah."
6333760,6336480," So, I would like some time to train a little bit."
6336480,6338600," I think that my cardio could be better."
6338600,6339600," I was tired."
6339600,6340600," I was tired too."
6340600,6343600," I didn't want to show it because the last thing you want to do is show your opponent"
6343600,6344760," you're tired."
6344760,6347040," But I was tired and I was in a lot of pain."
6347040,6348040," With me."
6348040,6349040," Yeah."
6349040,6350040," Yeah."
6350040,6354200," I, I sustained a knee injury during the fight that was, I mean, it's not Dennis's fault."
6354200,6356480," He didn't do anything illegal or anything like that."
6356480,6358880," But I, I grabbed his leg with his body."
6358880,6360440," It was really weird."
6360440,6362360," Like hopping, jumping, kick thing."
6362360,6363360," It was really odd."
6363360,6364360," Yeah."
6364360,6365560," And then you happen to grab and pull."
6365560,6366560," Yeah."
6366560,6370440," And you kind of pulled because he was like off the ground when you pulled, which was weird."
6370440,6373480," He kind of flew at you and then landed on your knee."
6373480,6374480," Yeah."
6374480,6377040," So I was really tired and I was in a lot of pain."
6377040,6379240," I want to get my knee like real good."
6379240,6382760," I want to get my cardio better and I want to get my flexibility better."
6382760,6385400," I was having a really hard time kicking high."
6385400,6390520," He edited this out of the video, but I was really tired that day and I was really sore."
6390520,6393080," I had played badminton the night before."
6393080,6394280," You should probably not do that next time."
6394280,6395280," Two hours."
6395280,6396280," Yeah."
6396280,6402200," And I had trained either the day before that or were two days before that and I hadn't"
6402200,6405040," fully recovered when I played badminton that night."
6405040,6408760," So I was, I was walking into the place and I didn't show it."
6408760,6410200," I didn't show it to Dennis."
6410200,6414200," So I recorded all of this to other like camera operators."
6414200,6416640," So he would only see it when he was editing the footage."
6416640,6422200," But I was like, like not sure if I was going to be able to kick it head level when I was"
6422200,6423680," going into it."
6423680,6426880," I think, I think there should be real changes if you guys fight again."
6426880,6428080," So that's, that's the thing."
6428080,6430800," I want some more time to work on my flexibility."
6430800,6433680," And here are the conditions of my rematch."
6433680,6435120," I want three minute rounds."
6435120,6436120," Yeah."
6436120,6438880," We only did one minute rounds, which is like three, one minute rounds."
6438880,6442840," The fact that, yeah, the fact that he couldn't get through a one minute round was ridiculous."
6442840,6444960," And the first round was not one minute."
6444960,6445960," There's no way."
6445960,6446960," Oh, really?"
6446960,6447960," The first round was way shorter."
6447960,6452040," Oh, I was just like, I was just like, it felt like the next two might have been"
6452040,6453600," longer than a minute."
6453600,6456280," So maybe it made up for it in the, in the overall duration."
6456280,6459200," But the first round was really short."
6459200,6460720," I want delay of match penalties."
6460720,6461720," Yes."
6461720,6462720," Clearly set out."
6462720,6464480," And the timer needs to start like immediately."
6464480,6465480," Yes."
6465480,6467880," Clearly set out."
6467880,6473640," And punching to the head and face is allowed."
6473640,6475120," You're okay with a broken nose?"
6475120,6476840," I mean, if it happens, it happens."
6476840,6477840," He's not going to hit me."
6477840,6478840," I'm just saying."
6478840,6479840," He's not going to hit me."
6479840,6480840," He's not going to hit me."
6480840,6483040," Uh, only face."
6483040,6484040," Yeah."
6484040,6485040," Sorry."
6485040,6486040," What?"
6486040,6487040," Headshots only."
6487040,6488040," Headshots only."
6488040,6490480," No, because then you just go like this and just kick."
6490480,6491480," Yeah, that's true."
6491480,6493440," It just becomes like, it's the same problem."
6493440,6498200," You have to have a reason to bring your hands down and you have to have a reason to bring"
6498200,6499200," your hands up."
6499200,6501200," Otherwise there's nothing to strike at."
6501200,6502520," That's actually something I was going to mention."
6502520,6505800," Maybe this gets solved with face punches being allowed."
6505800,6511320," But I was going to say, if a kick gets blocked to the side by an arm that did not have to"
6511320,6515400," move in order to cause the block, I think it should count as points."
6515400,6516880," Oh, I see what you mean."
6516880,6522080," No, I don't think you'd be able to do that because you can keep your, like you can feel"
6522080,6526480," that they're probably not going for a high strike and you can keep your hands low."
6526480,6528600," Like that's totally legit."
6528600,6530240," But you'd still move it."
6530240,6533160," Like some of the blocks he literally does nothing."
6533160,6534160," I know."
6534160,6535160," Yeah."
6535160,6537120," Like it should be intentional."
6537120,6540440," And even if your arm is already low, there's going to be an intentional thing to try to"
6540440,6541680," block a kick."
6541680,6544680," And there's just nothing it just didn't count."
6544680,6551520," Trevor, W and Flowplain says, I think I'm behind, but holy, those were only one minute"
6551520,6552520," round."
6552520,6553520," Yeah."
6553520,6562760," Like it was ridiculous to watch the, the, the time, not between rounds, but during the"
6562760,6568120," round, the time during the stoppages was longer than the round."
6568120,6569560," For I believe round two and three."
6569560,6570560," Yeah, probably."
6570560,6571560," Like it was."
6571560,6572560," Okay."
6572560,6573560," There are, okay."
6573560,6575120," There, I'd be willing to be flexible."
6575120,6577480," If he wants to do two minute rounds, I, I can."
6577480,6580360," Three is like pretty long considering his cardio."
6580360,6582280," Considering making that we're making a video too."
6582280,6587520," Like we've got to show everything, but not, but also edit it, you know, like it's, it's"
6587520,6588520," going to end up pretty long."
6588520,6591760," Would you guys be willing to stream it and set a date and stuff?"
6591760,6592760," Yeah."
6592760,6593760," Yeah, I'd be down."
6593760,6595000," Cause like it should be in, I think it should be an event."
6595000,6600800," I'd also be, I would also be open to instead of like doing face strikes, we could do side"
6600800,6602840," of the head and top of the head or something like that."
6602840,6604520," But you should be able to punch something."
6604520,6609960," But you must be able to get a point on the upper body with your hands because otherwise"
6609960,6611760," think about it."
6611760,6615040," What on earth can you do against someone who just comes at you like this?"
6615040,6617880," And it's just like, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick."
6617880,6621720," Like there's nothing to do other than grab their leg and throw them on the ground."
6621720,6622720," Yeah."
6622720,6623960," Which is what he's doing."
6623960,6624960," Yeah."
6624960,6625960," Yeah."
6625960,6632360," So I, I, I played, I played the game the way it had to be played, but that was not the"
6632360,6634040," way I wanted to play it."
6634040,6635600," I wanted to."
6635600,6641800," In, in Dennis's defense with a list of rules that existed, he played the game the way he"
6641800,6642800," should have done."
6642800,6643800," He did."
6643800,6644800," And he did really well."
6644800,6645800," He did."
6645800,6646800," All things considered."
6646800,6652800," I, I expected him to have about that level of cardio."
6652800,6656120," I did not expect him to be as proficient as he was."
6656120,6657120," Yeah."
6657120,6662240," Especially looking at, um, I watched on, there's a float plane exclusive with some of his earlier"
6662240,6663240," fight training."
6663240,6664240," Yeah."
6664240,6667480," He clearly had a lot of improvement over our relatively short period of time."
6667480,6668480," That'll happen."
6668480,6669480," Because you remember."
6669480,6672200," Because you have training and you're remembering and you're exactly."
6672200,6674640," I just, what just happened?"
6674640,6678400," Why did this start doing that?"
6678400,6679400," I got it."
6679400,6680400," That's weird."
6680400,6684960," Um, but yeah, I, I was very impressed with Dennis to be completely honest."
6684960,6685960," Um, yeah."
6685960,6688280," That's about it."
6688280,6689280," Yeah."
6689280,6690280," He did well."
6690280,6691640," So that's my, that's my conditions."
6691640,6693040," That's my conditions for the rematch."
6693040,6694040," I was at LTX."
6694040,6695760," You know, do it at LTX."
6695760,6700120," You know, Dennis actually suggested LTX and I said no, because I thought there was just"
6700120,6701920," LTX is so busy."
6701920,6703400," There's so much going on."
6703400,6704400," Yeah."
6704400,6708360," The thing I want is, okay, so let's say, let's say my nose does get broken."
6708360,6709360," It would have to be the end."
6709360,6711200," Or I aggravate my knee injury again."
6711200,6712200," But how could it be?"
6712200,6715680," Yeah, but we're both going to be exhausted from doing LTX, especially me."
6715680,6716680," That's true."
6716680,6717680," That's true."
6717680,6720600," So it like, yeah, I get it, but also, yeah."
6720600,6721600," Okay."
6721600,6722600," Sorry."
6722600,6723600," Something that someone else mentioned."
6723600,6724600," Why?"
6724600,6725600," Okay."
6725600,6729400," By below the belt, I don't mean crotch, but why is there nothing below the belt?"
6729400,6730960," Um, leg strikes or a thing."
6730960,6734360," Well, yeah, it's a thing, but it's also a thing that is very likely to cause it."
6734360,6735360," It's injury."
6735360,6736360," Okay."
6736360,6738080," I mean, I get it."
6738080,6741400," The martial art that I trained did allow leg sweeps."
6741400,6742400," Okay."
6742400,6745920," But only like a spinning leg sweep."
6745920,6751400," So it was kind of like how you get a lot of points for a spinning head kick."
6751400,6752400," It's slow."
6752400,6754240," It's slow and hard to point."
6754240,6761040," And it makes you extremely vulnerable because if you go down, sorry, if you go down like"
6761040,6767000," this, put your leg out, you're exposing the top of your head."
6767000,6773520," And we also allowed, we allowed, so in the, in the training that I had, in the, the sport"
6773520,6778440," that I did, our sparring allowed a back fist to the top of the head."
6778440,6781680," That was the way to make the head count for something."
6781680,6783160," You can do something like that too."
6783160,6786480," Like it doesn't, yes, the, the head points that we're trying to get is not because we"
6786480,6789000," want them to like get hurt."
6789000,6791260," Just destroy each other's skulls."
6791260,6793080," You just need to be able to score points there."
6793080,6798520," So if the whole thing was back of fist instead of like direct contact, that would be good."
6798520,6801760," Like it just, yeah, I just had so many opportunities to punch him."
6801760,6804080," So I was like, I just wanted to."
6804080,6807920," There needs to be some way to make you think about where your arms are and incentive ice"
6807920,6809880," needing to hold your arms up."
6809880,6810880," Yeah."
6810880,6815120," That like lands amass was the fight was Dennis cathartic."
6815120,6818440," Um, I think that's a great."
6818440,6819440," That's a good question."
6819440,6820440," It was fun."
6820440,6821440," Yeah, it was fun."
6821440,6825880," It looked like other than the knee injury that you guys were like into it and enjoying"
6825880,6826880," it."
6826880,6827880," Yeah."
6827880,6828880," Yeah."
6828880,6829880," No, I actually, I had a blast."
6829880,6831120," Like I haven't done, I haven't done this in 20 years."
6831120,6834920," Like I, and I would do like little tiny tournaments and stuff."
6834920,6836240," Like I'm a teenager, right?"
6836240,6838960," Like, you know, kid level tournaments."
6838960,6841320," But I haven't, I haven't sparred since then."
6841320,6842960," So yeah, it was fun."
6842960,6846400," So I want to mention Luke and Linus versus everyone else."
6846400,6850000," Do you have any idea how many people work here now?"
6850000,6851000," Yes."
6851000,6854720," It'd be an army."
6854720,6858640," They could just dog pile on top of us and we wouldn't be able to move."
6858640,6859640," Yeah."
6859640,6862440," And some of them are like quite large and proficient."
6862440,6863440," Yeah."
6863440,6864440," Like no."
6864440,6870160," Yeah, that would be, that would be, um, probably not even that entertaining to watch."
6870160,6873760," Hey, have you seen the theme for the Christmas party this year?"
6873760,6874760," No."
6874760,6876320," It's pretty awesome."
6876320,6879360," If I do say so myself, Yvonne and I worked on it together."
6879360,6883040," Fullplane has like an idea for our own sort of thing."
6883040,6884040," Oh, really?"
6884040,6885040," Yeah."
6885040,6887280," Um, so this is it."
6887280,6894200," Everyone gets, there are, I believe, yeah, there are 10 tables/teams."
6894200,6900840," And because it is our 10 year anniversary, every team gets a theme that is one of the"
6900840,6902480," anniversary materials."
6902480,6903480," Okay."
6903480,6904480," Okay."
6904480,6910280," So the teams are paper, cotton, leather, fruit slash flowers, wood, candy slash iron, wool"
6910280,6916880," slash copper, bronze, willow slash pottery and tin slash aluminum."
6916880,6924840," So you will be as, as usual, uh, asked to coordinate with your team to represent your"
6924840,6926320," theme."
6926320,6931920," And as usual, you don't have to participate, but everybody does."
6931920,6936120," Dan, you've done a Christmas party now, right?"
6936120,6937120," That's right."
6937120,6938120," Just the one, right?"
6938120,6939120," Yeah."
6939120,6940120," Okay."
6940120,6941120," Okay."
6941120,6942640," And would you recommend participating at the Christmas party?"
6942640,6943640," Fun is mandatory."
6943640,6944640," Oh, yeah."
6944640,6947480," No, you got to participate."
6947480,6948480," You should."
6948480,6949640," It's, it's part of it."
6949640,6950640," It's good."
6950640,6951640," It's a good go nuts."
6951640,6952640," It's a hoot."
6952640,6953640," Yeah."
6953640,6955160," Gabriel says, you guys always talk about them, but vaguely."
6955160,6956160," Yeah."
6956160,6957760," The reason for that is that it's an internal thing."
6957760,6958760," Yeah."
6958760,6959760," We don't like them."
6959760,6960760," Yeah."
6960760,6963240," Um, I, I, I, I don't know."
6963240,6969640," I guess I've never really asked anyone about it, but I want to maintain some, uh, separation."
6969640,6972720," Like this is not about this is not part of the thing."
6972720,6974560," We're not putting on a performance."
6974560,6977040," This is not about public relations."
6977040,6978700," This is not about anything."
6978700,6985240," This is a chance for us to have fun with each other and make it not about making videos"
6985240,6990720," for, for once, you know, like everything else we do is like, oh, but, but, but, but,"
6990720,6993440," it's content, you know, is it content?"
6993440,6994440," What's the content?"
6994440,6996440," No, no, oh my God."
6996440,6997440," No content."
6997440,6998440," Just Christmas party."
6998440,7006080," You know, so, um, that's, that's why it's, it's, it's not something that we have contentized."
7006080,7007080," Yeah."
7007080,7008080," Yeah."
7008080,7009080," Yeah."
7009080,7010080," It's fun though."
7010080,7011080," It's fun."
7011080,7012080," That's cool."
7012080,7013080," That makes sense for a theme."
7013080,7014080," Yeah."
7014080,7015080," Yeah."
7015080,7016080," I'm excited."
7016080,7017080," Yeah."
7017080,7018080," 10 years."
7018080,7019080," It's been a long time."
7019080,7020080," 10 years."
7020080,7024560," I was thinking the other day, I think it's 12 for us or something."
7024560,7025560," Yeah."
7025560,7026560," Yeah."
7026560,7027560," It's just ridiculous."
7027560,7029760," It's creeping on half the amount of time we've been alive."
7029760,7030760," I know, right?"
7030760,7031760," It'll get there eventually maybe."
7031760,7032760," Yeah."
7032760,7034600," I think Yvonne and I crossed that threshold very recently."
7034600,7035600," Yeah."
7035600,7036600," We've been."
7036600,7037600," It's an interesting one."
7037600,7039000," Together for half of our alive time."
7039000,7042960," And when you consider how little you remember of the beginning of your alive time, like our"
7042960,7050160," actual part that we know of, it's like most of it."
7050160,7055120," What was life like when an idea didn't have you there?"
7055120,7056600," I don't know anymore."
7056600,7057600," Yeah."
7057600,7058600," It's wild."
7058600,7059600," It's interesting."
7059600,7063520," If I fan out for the Christmas party, no."
7063520,7069040," It's literally the point is to not do that."
7069040,7072920," It's really nice having the day to just not be on if you don't want to be."
7072920,7076080," Like the only day it is."
7076080,7078360," It's having a super private is super nice."
7078360,7079360," Yeah, it's good."
7079360,7080360," It's our thing."
7080360,7081360," Yeah."
7081360,7083560," Deal with it."
7083560,7084680," Should we do some merch messages?"
7084680,7086880," I think that's it for the main topics."
7086880,7089280," But we have a ton of merch messages to talk to you guys about."
7089280,7090760," I have a lot that are potential."
7090760,7092240," You can have a look at those if you fancy."
7092240,7093480," I can start going through those."
7093480,7094480," Yeah, for sure."
7094480,7095480," All of them are just for Linus anyways."
7095480,7097920," Do you want to read us some curated ones?"
7097920,7098920," Hit me."
7098920,7099920," Sure."
7099920,7100920," Let's see."
7100920,7101920," Ben asks, hello Linus."
7101920,7106720," For eyes of power consumption of computers, I have hit an issue in the USA where I cannot"
7106720,7108640," run four computers on the same room."
7108640,7112760," Do you have any suggestions for people who are stuck with a 15 amp breaker?"
7112760,7116120," Currently, I have to run an extension cord."
7116120,7118800," Also run the GPU for Plex."
7118800,7124120," That is a spectacularly first world problem, just saying."
7124120,7127440," So good for you having four computers?"
7127440,7128440," No."
7128440,7130280," No, I don't have another solution."
7130280,7135800," I mean, I could suggest stuff that might be super illegal."
7135800,7144000," Like you could at your breaker combine that circuit and run it at 2.4 people."
7144000,7147240," That would give you some more power."
7147240,7151680," That's really stupid though, don't do that."
7151680,7155720," Because you could just fry other things that you plug into those outlets."
7155720,7156720," Pretty sweet."
7156720,7162160," Like a computer around 240 volt, because modern switching power supplies and all that."
7162160,7164560," So yeah, you could do that."
7164560,7173520," You could buy all new computers that are more efficient."
7173520,7177000," Don't do that."
7177000,7182720," You could have an electrician come in and install new wiring with new circuits in part of the"
7182720,7184200," room."
7184200,7185200," That's expensive."
7185200,7186800," I'm sure you thought of that."
7186800,7189080," And that's a bad solution."
7189080,7193040," Or you could run an extension cord, which is what you're doing now."
7193040,7196840," Okay, in all seriousness though, there may actually be nearby circuits that you could"
7196840,7197840," tap into."
7197840,7203280," So if there's a room on the other side of the wall, for example, again, this might not"
7203280,7205720," be too code either."
7205720,7210320," But you could probably find an electrician buddy who might be willing to do it and it"
7210320,7211960," wouldn't be dangerous."
7211960,7218360," To take that outlet, open up the wall on both sides, turn it around, patch up the wall,"
7218360,7222160," and then you'd at least have one outlet in the room that was on a circuit that was intended"
7222160,7223520," for another room."
7223520,7226400," So it's probably on a separate circuit."
7226400,7230800," And that would be, yeah, that would be the way that I would probably say is the safest,"
7230800,7232800," most legit way to do that."
7232800,7248320," I was a weird gift from my parents."
7248320,7249320," Yeah."
7249320,7250320," Yeah."
7250320,7252120," I don't know what happened to that jacket."
7252120,7255160," I have no idea either."
7255160,7256400," And I definitely don't have it."
7256400,7257920," It's not me."
7257920,7260080," But that jacket got worn by like everyone."
7260080,7261080," Yeah."
7261080,7262360," At some point or another."
7262360,7266640," We were quite cold in the garage at the beginning of the company."
7266640,7269800," We had a community jacket."
7269800,7270800," Yeah."
7270800,7273080," We've come pretty far."
7273080,7275000," Sorry, floodplain."
7275000,7276000," Whoops."
7276000,7277000," What?"
7277000,7278480," Oh, my mic was muted."
7278480,7279480," Oh."
7279480,7280480," Yeah."
7280480,7281480," I'm out of practice."
7281480,7282480," Oh."
7282480,7289720," They asked about the old like mil spec jacket I used to wear with like with camel on it."
7289720,7290720," Yeah."
7290720,7291720," No, no, no, no."
7291720,7292720," What was the question?"
7292720,7295320," The question, do you want to say it again?"
7295320,7296320," Yeah."
7296320,7297960," Linus used to wear a CAD-PAT-PARKA."
7297960,7304760," Matthew was wondering if he was in the armed forces or just perpetually cold."
7304760,7307480," CAD-PAT is in Canadian pattern, Canadian camouflage."
7307480,7308480," Oh, okay."
7308480,7310480," I'm pretty sure."
7310480,7313600," CAD, CAD, C-A-D, P-A-T, right?"
7313600,7314600," CAD-PAT."
7314600,7315600," Yes."
7315600,7316600," Yes."
7316600,7317600," Next one."
7317600,7318600," Sure."
7318600,7321520," This is from anonymous."
7321520,7322520," Hi, Linus."
7322520,7326320," Do you have any plans to make a video about the massive backpack shipment coming in and"
7326320,7329640," how the creator warehouse is turning that around?"
7329640,7333680," They would be interested to see how you master such a logistical challenge."
7333680,7335040," I don't."
7335040,7342480," The creator warehouse warehouse is actually run by the former logistics manager for NCIX."
7342480,7345680," And as far as I can tell, half of what he does is black magic."
7345680,7346840," I don't understand it."
7346840,7349280," So I can't be involved in everything."
7349280,7352960," And if it's running smoothly and they do ship a lot of orders per day, when they have"
7352960,7356360," the stuff in stock, it goes."
7356360,7358800," I don't ask questions."
7358800,7360800," Good."
7360800,7362280," You know?"
7362280,7363280," Thanks."
7363280,7368480," Josh M.S. been a while since I've been able to watch the show live."
7368480,7373280," When doing your smart home, stuff was savant, ever a thought."
7373280,7379360," I'm an installer for them and while highly proprietary, they seem to be leading the market."
7379360,7384280," Did you consider a bunch of different stuff or were you just sent things to put in your"
7384280,7385280," walls?"
7385280,7387120," No, I did consider a lot of different stuff."
7387120,7390040," No, savant is not something that I looked into."
7390040,7392280," I mean, that's the issue though, is there's like..."
7392280,7393280," Oh, what?"
7393280,7395080," So it's shocking."
7395080,7401120," Like you look at how many weird proprietary closed ecosystems there are for smart home"
7401120,7402840," stuff."
7402840,7410520," And how many people do you know that have smart anything in their houses and you kind of go"
7410520,7415080," everything I know about minimum order quantities for products and how much it costs to engineer"
7415080,7416080," a product."
7416080,7418520," And the math just doesn't make sense."
7418520,7419520," I've thought about this before."
7419520,7420520," I have a weird theory on it."
7420520,7421880," I could be just completely out to lunch."
7421880,7429080," But do you know how the thing where like every Vegas hotel, the company that owns the hotel"
7429080,7433960," also owns the companies that supply all the clocks and the sheets and the cleaning supplies"
7433960,7436760," and the order or not the order and put soap and all that kind of stuff."
7436760,7439080," I feel like it's a similar thing."
7439080,7443560," I feel like contractor construction companies that are building like high rises that have"
7443560,7446800," hodlm automation and stuff spin up these things."
7446800,7447800," I don't know."
7447800,7449040," I honestly don't know."
7449040,7451080," But I don't understand how the math works."
7451080,7452080," Yeah, because it's crazy."
7452080,7454040," There's so many of these companies."
7454040,7457640," And I know very few people that have anything installed at all."
7457640,7459680," And usually when they do, it's very simple."
7459680,7462520," It doesn't have like just switches everywhere."
7462520,7463760," Yeah, I don't get it."
7463760,7466560," Yeah, pay extra to not have it be smart."
7466560,7467560," Yeah."
7467560,7468560," Yeah."
7468560,7469560," Yeah."
7469560,7470560," With TVs."
7470560,7471560," Okay, let's move on here."
7471560,7474680," We've got another one from anonymous question for Luke about the yard podcast."
7474680,7477840," Who is your favorite member and or favorite guest they have had on the show?"
7477840,7479640," I have no idea what this is."
7479640,7480640," Wow."
7480640,7485000," I didn't think we have a question about another podcast on our podcast."
7485000,7486000," Oh, yeah."
7486000,7487000," This is a podcast."
7487000,7488000," I'm a meta."
7488000,7490440," I like slime."
7490440,7493240," He's how I found the show and I find him entertained."
7493240,7494240," They're all really good though."
7494240,7495240," They're entertaining."
7495240,7496240," I like slime too."
7496240,7498160," It's like goopy."
7498160,7499160," Slime likes you."
7499160,7502440," Oh, well that just got really awkward."
7502440,7505720," It's a hangout on a barn sometime or something."
7505720,7506720," Don't worry about it."
7506720,7507720," A barn?"
7507720,7508720," Yeah, don't worry about it."
7508720,7509720," That's fine."
7509720,7510720," Okay."
7510720,7511720," Next question."
7511720,7512720," Cool."
7512720,7513720," Hey, sure."
7513720,7515200," Is this a person?"
7515200,7516200," Yes."
7516200,7517200," I hope so."
7517200,7518200," Don't worry about it."
7518200,7522480," Do you think USB could ever get to the point where it would be the standard used to connect"
7522480,7524600," all components inside a PC?"
7524600,7525600," No."
7525600,7526600," Yeah."
7526600,7528600," This is like an XKCD thing."
7528600,7530360," It's another standard."
7530360,7531960," It's just not made for that."
7531960,7532960," Yeah."
7532960,7537560," It's what's great about USB is it's hot pluggable and it's like super backwards and forwards"
7537560,7546160," and patable but that's not necessarily what you want for plugging in an RGB header on"
7546160,7549720," your light strip."
7549720,7551720," So no, it's never going to be everything."
7551720,7555880," Yeah, there's different standards for different things, right?"
7555880,7556880," Tommy W.S."
7556880,7561880," High Linus, do you have any advice on building a team for a small startup?"
7561880,7566720," I feel like I'm the wrong person to ask because my hiring strategy was to just hire people"
7566720,7571120," I liked and then hire people that they knew."
7571120,7578640," Honestly, I do know how to hire but I'm not methodical about it."
7578640,7580240," I'm kind of scattershot."
7580240,7588280," I'll ask weird questions during an interview and if I get a good vibe then I'll go for it."
7588280,7595480," There's really way more structured ways to do HR that I haven't studied, I haven't practiced."
7595480,7598240," I'm not qualified to give advice on."
7598240,7605480," I mean, I can say that you want to pick a team that you are okay being stuck in a small"
7605480,7612000," room with eight hours a day, five days a week at minimum, right?"
7612000,7618560," That is actually really important so I was good at that part but there's a lot of stuff"
7618560,7620600," that I'm not that great at."
7620600,7622480," AJ points out in chat."
7622480,7623800," I barely had an interview."
7623800,7624800," Yeah, that's true."
7624800,7628720," Yeah, like what do we know?"
7628720,7634320," I do a lot now but I don't think we count as a startup anymore."
7634320,7635320," So yeah."
7635320,7641000," Alex B. asks, getting a screwdriver today and saving for the backpack, which two fantastic"
7641000,7645840," launches in the last couple of months, which product are you most proud of, the screwdriver"
7645840,7646840," or the backpack?"
7646840,7654480," That's like asking me which of my children I love more, my son or Luke."
7654480,7658160," There's no way, there's no way I'm going to pick one."
7658160,7660800," I love both of them equally."
7660800,7665400," They were both a ton of work."
7665400,7670560," I hope to have many years with both of them."
7670560,7672160," Am I talking about Luke and my son?"
7672160,7674360," Am I talking about the screwdriver and the backpack?"
7674360,7675360," We don't know."
7675360,7678920," Okay, which one of your kids had a bit of upbringing then?"
7678920,7682800," Was the screwdriver easier to raise or was the backpack easier to raise?"
7682800,7689720," Well, the screwdriver was real challenging pre-birth but the backpack is proving itself"
7689720,7696680," to be a bit of a post-birth, a difficult one to deal with."
7696680,7697680," So yeah."
7697680,7698680," Yeah."
7698680,7699680," Difficult child, difficult child."
7699680,7700680," Yeah."
7700680,7705520," All right, Wayne asks, other than USB cables, LTT is planning to make."
7705520,7707200," What other cables would you like to make?"
7707200,7710840," HDMI, DisplayPort, Cat5e, Cat6, coaxial for..."
7710840,7714920," I don't think we're going to get into network cables."
7714920,7717280," That's just such a..."
7717280,7719920," That's a deep, deep, deep rabbit hole."
7719920,7726520," I could absolutely see us doing HDMI DisplayPort coax, I think, is pretty unlikely."
7726520,7730920," But it kind of depends on how USB and display cables go."
7730920,7735840," I think our ideal world would be that with our cable management product plus our cables,"
7735840,7739040," you'd have everything you need for your PC setup."
7739040,7742480," I think USB and display is probably enough to be completely honest."
7742480,7743480," We can do power."
7743480,7744920," I want SDI cables."
7744920,7747600," I can't find one on the market that works for me."
7747600,7748600," Oh, really?"
7748600,7749600," Well, what's your problem?"
7749600,7752080," They're not flexible or 4K enough."
7752080,7753080," Oh, okay."
7753080,7755560," So you want them to be a flexible and 4K."
7755560,7756560," Yeah."
7756560,7761480," It's not like a coaxial stable that is good for a long-term camera use, right?"
7761480,7762480," Oh."
7762480,7763960," I mean, yeah, we could look into it."
7763960,7764960," I think we were."
7764960,7767560," And it was just extremely expensive."
7767560,7768560," Yeah."
7768560,7769560," Well, there's your problem."
7769560,7770560," That makes sense."
7770560,7771560," Okay."
7771560,7772560," Moving on."
7772560,7773560," Let's see."
7773560,7775480," We've got one from Michael here."
7775480,7778240," Do you have another recommendation other than the..."
7778240,7779240," I..."
7779240,7780240," Ring."
7780240,7781920," I don't want to say it wrong now."
7781920,7782920," I'm scared."
7782920,7784360," Have you tried circular?"
7784360,7785360," I haven't."
7785360,7787160," I don't have another recommendation."
7787160,7790920," That's the really frustrating thing about this is, aside from them being really difficult"
7790920,7793080," to deal with, I really like the product."
7793080,7794080," Yeah."
7794080,7797160," Sorry."
7797160,7802680," And like for me, honestly, the whole health tracking thing is very take it or leave it."
7802680,7804160," I have been blessed."
7804160,7811680," I've been very lucky to not really have to worry about tracking my blood oxygen level"
7811680,7813320," or anything like that."
7813320,7814320," Like I just kind of..."
7814320,7816320," I eat when I'm hungry."
7816320,7821600," I sort of move around more when I feel like I'm getting a spare tire."
7821600,7822600," I just..."
7822600,7824840," I kind of do what my body tells me to do."
7824840,7827520," I don't need a ring to tell me to do any of that."
7827520,7828800," But I just kind of liked it."
7828800,7830880," It was just kind of numbers for geeks for me."
7830880,7836000," So I'm probably not going to go actively pursuing an alternative to it because the only reason"
7836000,7839120," I ever used it in the first place was because they sent me one for free."
7839120,7842760," And I figured I had better try this if we're going to do a sponsored video on it."
7842760,7844640," And it's like a health product."
7844640,7846800," So I probably just won't do anything."
7846800,7848080," I mean, same sort of vein."
7848080,7849480," You're not wearing your watch today?"
7849480,7850480," No."
7850480,7852280," I forgot to put on my watch this morning."
7852280,7856520," I do have that with things ScanWatch and it's like cool, I guess."
7856520,7859760," Because I kind of have like a reverse merch message now."
7859760,7860760," Oh you do?"
7860760,7866440," Your watch that you're wearing now like isn't a pebble."
7866440,7871200," And so Shank would like to ask you why you're not wearing the pebble that he..."
7871200,7874440," This is the problem with gifts, but it's also there."
7874440,7876400," Oh, you got it on the backpack."
7876400,7877400," That's awesome."
7877400,7879120," I just wanted to friendly rib you about it."
7879120,7880520," I will."
7880520,7883080," I will daily drive it again."
7883080,7885160," I will give it a shot."
7885160,7886360," I will give it a shot."
7886360,7888800," But I appreciate the gift."
7888800,7893600," And for me, it's more about like remembering the pebble."
7893600,7896960," The one good smart watch I ever owned, the pebble time."
7896960,7897960," Great."
7897960,7901000," I'm sure hippie happy to hear that."
7901000,7902280," Another one from Anonymous."
7902280,7907880," Would LMG ever consider absorbing a content creator assuming it was mutually beneficial?"
7907880,7910480," The brand didn't trade on existing content, that sort of thing."
7910480,7915480," We sort of have."
7915480,7916480," Really?"
7916480,7917480," With Horst, right?"
7917480,7918480," No."
7918480,7924000," No, he was working for like, he was doing like local like community video for a big company."
7924000,7925000," I guess he's not."
7925000,7926000," He's not."
7926000,7927000," He's channel."
7927000,7928000," Yeah, no."
7928000,7929000," No, well he is now."
7929000,7930000," Wasn't."
7930000,7931000," Yeah."
7931000,7932000," Yeah."
7932000,7933000," What do you think?"
7933000,7934000," What should we do?"
7934000,7936160," Should we go on a big like acquisitions spree?"
7936160,7940440," I think in a lot of situations it isn't the right move."
7940440,7946920," I think if it was the right move that we would do it, and we've technically tried in the"
7946920,7953480," past and then it was decided mutually that it wasn't the right move."
7953480,7954480," Yeah."
7954480,7955480," I mean, it can be the right move."
7955480,7959720," I ran into both mythical and smosh down at creator summit and they seem okay."
7959720,7961480," They seem to be doing great."
7961480,7962480," Yeah."
7962480,7963480," Sounds good."
7963480,7965720," But I think those situations will be rare."
7965720,7968040," They found one which is fantastic."
7968040,7969640," But yeah, situations are rare."
7969640,7971520," Never say never."
7971520,7973960," But I mean, I don't."
7973960,7980560," A big part of what makes a YouTube channel work is the team that has made it work."
7980560,7987400," And so I feel like unless you're acquiring the talent, you better have a really solid"
7987400,7992360," plan for how you're going to maintain the soul of that media property because it isn't"
7992360,7993440," just a media property."
7993440,7995080," But then there are exceptions."
7995080,8001640," Now that the business is maturing, you're seeing some channels that really were started"
8001640,8007840," just as business endeavors and are structured more like traditional media companies."
8007840,8011080," And so yeah, there could be situations where it might make sense."
8011080,8015560," With that said, I think our expertise is building YouTube channels and brands."
8015560,8024320," So there will always be the question every time of could we just build it ourselves?"
8024320,8028920," And if we could, then should we do that instead?"
8028920,8035160," And if we can't, then is this such a unicorn that we can like can we even afford something"
8035160,8037440," that's so amazing that we couldn't have done it?"
8037440,8042160," And so the answer to those, the answer to the questions have to be yes, I can afford"
8042160,8045360," it and know we couldn't build it."
8045360,8051200," That seems like a small overlapping then diagram circle, you know?"
8051200,8055840," Okay, we got a special message here from Jeff."
8055840,8062800," We wanted to give a happy birthday to his wife, Sarah Blankenship."
8062800,8068440," She's one of the rare and amazing human females that love LDT, the entire crew, including"
8068440,8070640," myself apparently."
8070640,8073840," And yeah, I just wanted to say you guys could wish her a happy birthday."
8073840,8075240," Yeah, happy birthday Sarah."
8075240,8078960," So that's always a fun one."
8078960,8079960," Another one from Samuel."
8079960,8084720," What is the reasoning why IGPUs are not benchmarked during CPU reviews?"
8084720,8089160," When you talk about ultra budget computers using an IGPU can be a good idea, but it's"
8089160,8091000," hard to tell which ones are good or not."
8091000,8092000," Yeah, it's a good question."
8092000,8095920," I would say that with Ryzen 7000, the reason we didn't really talk about it was because"
8095920,8101040," if you're spending that kind of money on a CPU, the IGPU is a co-processor."
8101040,8105040," It's for hardware, video encoding or something like that."
8105040,8108680," It's for whatever features you might take advantage of on that IGPU."
8108680,8115000," I don't realistically expect you to game on it in the longer term because you just bought"
8115000,8123480," DR5 memory, a $250 to $500 motherboard and like a $300 plus dollar CPU."
8123480,8124960," Like what are you doing?"
8124960,8131400," If you're spending that kind of money and you don't have a graphics card, you did it"
8131400,8132400," wrong."
8132400,8133640," You didn't build a balanced machine."
8133640,8139480," So from my point of view, it's kind of irrelevant in the context of that product."
8139480,8147120," But if we were reviewing something that is like a $139 chip that could very well go in"
8147120,8151160," a $50 board and use on-board graphics for an extended period of time, then it would"
8151160,8154280," absolutely be something that we would look at more closely."
8154280,8157960," I think got another one here for Menonas."
8157960,8162360," Do you think Google is simply not interested in maintaining a product that doesn't print"
8162360,8166920," money and have billions of users the way Search, Android and YouTube do?"
8166920,8169560," Yeah, I mean you see that in any large company, right?"
8169560,8174560," There's the whole innovators dilemma thing where it's really, really hard as an established"
8174560,8180240," company to start up new business endeavors because they are inherently not worth the"
8180240,8183360," time and attention that they require."
8183360,8188480," So that's why acquisitions are so common for as companies get larger and larger and larger"
8188480,8193400," because you can't never innovate because then eventually someone will come and eat"
8193400,8198280," your lunch and you can't innovate because it's a waste of time and money to innovate."
8198280,8201240," You know what I mean?"
8201240,8207920," Yeah, obviously they're looking for the next big home run because nothing else is even"
8207920,8208920," going to register."
8208920,8212520," It's like a million dollar business to us, right?"
8212520,8218640," Like a million dollar product idea to us, so that's, you talk in terms of yearly revenue."
8218640,8220520," That's a big deal, right?"
8220520,8225960," Million dollars is a lot of money to Google."
8225960,8228760," Rounding error, irrelevant, right?"
8228760,8235720," So they're operating at this just completely, utterly different scale, right?"
8235720,8240440," And honestly, I don't have the background to really speak to the kinds of decision making"
8240440,8242640," processes that a company like that would go through."
8242640,8243640," That's scale."
8243640,8244640," Yeah."
8244640,8245640," I don't get it."
8245640,8246800," Some of the stuff is just bizarre though."
8246800,8247800," Yeah, for sure."
8247800,8250400," What is it like meat and other more different meat?"
8250400,8251760," Meat, new and duo."
8251760,8255120," Like how that went through is astonishing."
8255120,8257040," Like I just."
8257040,8261520," And meanwhile, the meat teams, you know, watching project cancellations are looking at it going,"
8261520,8262520," which meat?"
8262520,8264920," Yeah, yep."
8264920,8273600," I just want them to build one final video conferencing platform called Beyond Meat."
8273600,8275760," Know how I timed it for when he was drinking?"
8275760,8278280," That was on purpose."
8278280,8279280," Almost got him."
8279280,8280280," He's mauled."
8280280,8281280," He got it."
8281280,8282280," He got it."
8282280,8286040," He did spit it all over the laptop."
8286040,8287840," It's his laptop too."
8287840,8288840," Jeez."
8288840,8289840," Oh man."
8289840,8310560," I'm going to make a video about this."
8310560,8313160," I think it's a temporal problem, right?"
8313160,8314960," So yes."
8314960,8319800," I have cool stuff and whatever."
8319800,8326640," And so does that change what people might want or might aspire to?"
8326640,8330120," Or does that change my perception of what people might want or aspire to?"
8330120,8331520," No, I don't think so."
8331520,8335600," I think it just means that I'm there a little bit earlier, right?"
8335600,8341760," Like we've seen this throughout the entire existence of modern electronics and technologies"
8341760,8349320," that when it comes, it comes for a select view, whether it starts out in the enterprise"
8349320,8352480," or starts out as a like, okay, smart phones are a perfect example."
8352480,8355400," Starts out as this niche thing for the Uber wealthy."
8355400,8357720," Like I forget who it is."
8357720,8359960," Someone here knows someone."
8359960,8366320," I think it might be James who knows like intimately knows a like a home automation installer."
8366320,8373880," And he was telling me about the kind of stuff that like the Uber wealthy have in their homes."
8373880,8380080," Like we're talking motorized TV mounts where it like goes back and hides in a completely"
8380080,8381640," invisible wall panel."
8381640,8385240," And then it comes out and angles out this way so that they can watch TV while they're"
8385240,8386400," in the kitchen."
8386400,8391080," And it's like specifically for that or like subwoofers that are under the ground so that"
8391080,8392640," they are won't be visible."
8392640,8397440," And they actually shake the ground by the pool side so you can like really get into your"
8397440,8400000," party vibe or like whatever it is."
8400000,8406160," This stuff exists now has existed for 10 or 20 years, right?"
8406160,8408440," But you don't have it."
8408440,8410600," You don't even aspire to it."
8410600,8415800," And yet even wall mounting a TV was unheard of 10, 15 years ago."
8415800,8417640," That wasn't mainstream, right?"
8417640,8418640," Yeah."
8418640,8419640," Well, I think."
8419640,8420640," And now it's just normal."
8420640,8421640," Well, yeah, you just wall mount your TV."
8421640,8425960," I think it's almost irrelevant and that might be surprising."
8425960,8432680," But what I would say is that as long as you try to keep yourself true to explaining how"
8432680,8436160," good or cool something is and you point out the price points."
8436160,8437160," Sure."
8437160,8439280," That's for the other people to decide."
8439280,8442600," But the my point is that the price point will come."
8442600,8450120," So what LTT has really always been is really cool cutting edge stuff."
8450120,8457920," And that might not be today for everybody, but it will come eventually, no matter what"
8457920,8464560," game it is, no matter what, you know, rip in tier, fast CPU or GPU it is, someday it will"
8464560,8466120," be cheap."
8466120,8468640," Every experience will eventually come."
8468640,8474320," And so I think that we do get a lot of criticism for not talking about low-end hardware."
8474320,8478600," And I think a big part of that has been that I've never been a fan of low-end hardware."
8478600,8480160," I want high-end hardware."
8480160,8482800," I'll take used high-end hardware."
8482800,8483800," Absolutely."
8483800,8488200," I totally understand not everybody has the budget for brand new high-end hardware."
8488200,8489920," Been there."
8489920,8492720," But that doesn't mean you shouldn't buy good stuff."
8492720,8495920," Don't buy bad stuff."
8495920,8499400," And that also doesn't mean that you should get the highest-end stuff either."
8499400,8502400," Like, there's a there's a sweet spot."
8502400,8503720," It's all about the sweet spot."
8503720,8507600," I guess that's what I'm trying to say."
8507600,8513520," So yeah, I do think there are things a lot of people won't notice."
8513520,8519680," But I also think that it's sort of my job to figure out what you will notice and what"
8519680,8523400," you should direct your resources toward."
8523400,8526920," Also up to the crowd to decide if they will notice it or not."
8526920,8530040," Like the example you gave of noticing FPS past 120 Hertz."
8530040,8534640," Okay, so first of all, FPS and refresh rate are not equivalent."
8534640,8539480," There are benefits to higher frame rates other than just making sure that you've got whatever"
8539480,8544840," matches your monitor because it decreases the latency of your inputs."
8544840,8551600," So yes, most people won't notice a refresh rate with an appropriately high frame rate"
8551600,8553520," passed about 120 Hertz."
8553520,8555640," But we've made that video."
8555640,8560440," And we've also made videos where we talk about these higher refresh rates monitors and how"
8560440,8562160," they do feel smoother."
8562160,8563480," And they do feel better."
8563480,8568760," And if you could have one for a reasonable price or for a small uplift over one that isn't"
8568760,8571520," uber high refresh rate, well, then you might as well go for it."
8571520,8576960," It's just a matter of when that is going to intersect with so that you've got like the"
8576960,8579200," desirability of it and the cost of it."
8579200,8581280," Where do those lines meet for you?"
8581280,8582280," Right?"
8582280,8583280," It's all personal."
8583280,8585040," All we can talk about is what it is."
8585040,8587640," And it's up to you to determine if it has a value for you."
8587640,8588640," Okay."
8588640,8590920," I got another one here from Emmanuel."
8590920,8596520," Hey Linus has inflation and the current negative market affected LTT in any way."
8596520,8605560," Also happy to get my hand happy to finally get my hands on one of the LTT screwdrivers."
8605560,8611280," Has it gotten easier to hire devs?"
8611280,8612280," Hiring devs is still a nightmare."
8612280,8614280," We're also in Vancouver."
8614280,8615920," Yeah, it doesn't help."
8615920,8616920," Yeah."
8616920,8617920," So like not really to be honest."
8617920,8623760," Because I mean, we haven't had any layoffs or anything like that, but there's been industry"
8623760,8624760," layoffs."
8624760,8630640," So like, yeah, like we're not, by the way, we're fine."
8630640,8636120," I've had a lot of people late applying."
8636120,8639040," Like the post is still up on the website because we're like kind of still interested"
8639040,8640680," in collecting resumes."
8640680,8641680," But I'll see."
8641680,8643440," This is actually kind of interesting."
8643440,8648800," I'll see like so and so company lays off like some huge percentage of their workforce."
8648800,8652120," And then our resume intake goes like, right?"
8652120,8653120," Yeah."
8653120,8654120," And it's okay."
8654120,8656160," Interesting."
8656160,8657840," But it hasn't become easier."
8657840,8661080," Any impact on us would be from external sources."
8661080,8664120," We are pretty well diversified now and a big part of that."
8664120,8666120," Hey, thanks for buying that screwdriver."
8666120,8671960," Is you guys so much of our funding comes directly from our community that it would be"
8671960,8679840," very difficult for us to reach a position where we could be crippled by economic conditions"
8679840,8683480," that are outside of our control."
8683480,8686560," We might see some advertising pullback."
8686560,8690920," I don't know that it's been significant yet, but we could see something like that."
8690920,8692360," We might see AdSense dip."
8692360,8693560," I don't know."
8693560,8699240," But you know, okay, let's say they fall by 30% each or something like that."
8699240,8700240," We'd still survive."
8700240,8701240," We're good."
8701240,8702240," So, last."
8702240,8703240," Okay."
8703240,8710320," From Richard on the subject of companies, Killing Services/Products."
8710320,8712200," Is there anything you wish stuck around?"
8712200,8713880," I wish Nexus devices."
8713880,8717400," What on earth is a Nexus device?"
8717400,8719040," That's what pixels were."
8719040,8721040," Yeah, oh, yes of course."
8721040,8722040," Yeah."
8722040,8723560," It was like I think I had one of those."
8723560,8727960," Cheap crappy Android phones and tablets except they weren't that crappy because Google was"
8727960,8728960," subsidizing them."
8728960,8729960," They were awesome."
8729960,8730960," Yeah."
8730960,8731960," They were like private."
8731960,8733960," But they were priced like cheap crappy Google."
8733960,8734960," That's dangerous to do."
8734960,8736960," They were kind of great."
8736960,8742280," Yeah, I mean Nexus device is definitely a good one."
8742280,8744760," I wish Oculus was still Oculus."
8744760,8745760," That would have been cool."
8745760,8748760," Oh, you're going to make me cry."
8748760,8751160," That one hurts a lot actually."
8751160,8752160," Right through the heart."
8752160,8754000," I got a DK one."
8754000,8755000," I was been there from the start."
8755000,8756000," You know what?"
8756000,8757000," I missed DFI."
8757000,8760440," Man, they're like LAN party motherboards with the U.S."
8760440,8761440," But the U.V."
8761440,8762800," Reactive slots and stuff."
8762800,8768160," They were like there was a short period there where they were like just the shiz when it"
8768160,8770840," came to overclocking and all that."
8770840,8777920," I'm sad that case labs is Dunzo because I never made enough money to ever afford a case"
8777920,8778920," labs case."
8778920,8779920," Yeah."
8779920,8782680," So I never got to experience it and now they're gone."
8782680,8785040," And that's just sad."
8785040,8792880," But for me, I mean, you did make enough money at some point to afford one, but you got free"
8792880,8794080," computers by then."
8794080,8795880," Not really when they were alive."
8795880,8798000," Not in not in shut down until like two years ago."
8798000,8799000," Are you talking about it?"
8799000,8800160," That was more than two years."
8800160,8801160," Shut up."
8801160,8802160," No, really?"
8802160,8803160," Was it not?"
8803160,8805640," I thought it was closer to like four."
8805640,8806640," No."
8806640,8807640," August 2018."
8807640,8809560," Oh, four years."
8809560,8812560," You could have afforded a case labs case four years ago."
8812560,8813560," Stop."
8813560,8814560," Not on my metrics."
8814560,8815560," Shut up."
8815560,8817560," Everyone's version of a vulnerability is personal."
8817560,8819760," Nothing but chicken breast."
8819760,8822200," Chicken breast is expensive right now, dude."
8822200,8823200," It wasn't."
8823200,8824200," Grocery bills are going."
8824200,8826040," It wasn't four years ago."
8826040,8827880," I mean, don't lose a goal post."
8827880,8830640," They're just giving away budgies in the park."
8830640,8838120," Nobody wants you to know this, but the budgies in the park are free."
8838120,8840080," I have dozens of them."
8840080,8841880," I food mills content."
8841880,8842880," Nothing."
8842880,8846240," I'm going to take them."
8846240,8847400," That's a good reference."
8847400,8848400," I'm so sorry."
8848400,8850960," Um, are we even talking about?"
8850960,8851960," Yeah."
8851960,8852960," Yeah."
8852960,8853960," What were we talking about?"
8853960,8856520," We're talking about that you are the biggest cheapskate ever."
8856520,8857800," Yeah, pretty much."
8857800,8860080," You could have afforded a case labs case just fine."
8860080,8865600," It would not have been wise at that time."
8865600,8866600," It wouldn't have."
8866600,8868400," I was saving to buy a place instead."
8868400,8869400," Okay."
8869400,8870400," Yeah."
8870400,8872400," So anything is unaffordable."
8872400,8873400," Yes."
8873400,8878560," If your bar is literally that I am not spending a dollar."
8878560,8880840," So candy bars."
8880840,8885840," If only I could have had a KitKat bar before that."
8885840,8887000," Yeah, well, you could have."
8887000,8889000," You just like."
8889000,8890000," It's a what though."
8890000,8891000," It's not a need."
8891000,8892000," Oh my God."
8892000,8893000," That's very pragmatic."
8893000,8894000," My case was fine."
8894000,8895000," I'm with Luke on this."
8895000,8896000," Yeah."
8896000,8897000," All right."
8897000,8898000," Let's move on."
8898000,8900600," James has as a bike rider on the next backpack."
8900600,8903240," Would you add reflective panels for increased visibility?"
8903240,8905400," You know, we wanted to do."
8905400,8910000," We wanted this one to be reflective down here at the very least."
8910000,8911800," I forget why we didn't do it."
8911800,8917080," I think it was like a durability concern because the reflective materials were not particularly"
8917080,8918440," durable."
8918440,8922400," And we figured that the solution to that would be that if you really wanted reflective"
8922400,8925480," stuff on it, you can get like reflective iron on patches and you could just put them"
8925480,8926480," on."
8926480,8929480," I know it's not a perfect answer, but that's the answer."
8929480,8931200," Who's that suggesting that it'll probably be a no?"
8931200,8934360," But I know there's been talk about a rain cover."
8934360,8935360," We are working on it."
8935360,8936360," What about a reflective one?"
8936360,8940720," It's not a bad idea, but I mean, yeah, the rain cover."
8940720,8941720," Okay."
8941720,8942720," Well, hold on."
8942720,8943720," Hold on."
8943720,8945280," I don't want to commit to anything because the rain cover first and foremost needs to"
8945280,8946280," be waterproof."
8946280,8950080," And if the reflectiveness will cost us anything in terms of waterproofness, I don't want"
8950080,8953120," to water resistant ish rain cover."
8953120,8956400," I wanted to actually stop water from getting into the bag."
8956400,8957880," Did you say waterproof?"
8957880,8961480," Nothing is waterproof."
8961480,8966240," Nothing is ever waterproof, but I want it to be as water resistant as possible."
8966240,8968440," Rain should not be a problem."
8968440,8970360," That would be the goal."
8970360,8972800," That would be the goal."
8972800,8974320," Okay."
8974320,8975320," 18."
8975320,8980240," FYI, I couldn't post a merch message on your Android."
8980240,8981800," Well logged in, but I can as a guest."
8981800,8984480," The live section didn't come up."
8984480,8987800," Would you guys try compressors on your mics when you're quiet?"
8987800,8988800," Oh, I think for me, the-"
8988800,8990680," Why is this a curated one?"
8990680,8995400," For me, the main concern is that I get too loud."
8995400,8998960," So I don't know if our compressor is actually tuned for when I'm too quiet."
8998960,9000160," I don't remember curating this one."
9000160,9001160," I did."
9001160,9002160," Sorry."
9002160,9003160," You did?"
9003160,9004160," Okay."
9004160,9005160," Yeah."
9005160,9008680," So we actually do have a compression stage in our audio chain."
9008680,9013080," We have both a hardware compressor and then also a software compressor."
9013080,9018440," The idea is I want to maintain Linus and Luke's dynamic range with being able to prevent"
9018440,9024320," any sort of digital clipping or even analog clipping from that stage there."
9024320,9028080," It's difficult to keep these guys in check."
9028080,9031800," The mic position is not always right."
9031800,9037720," You've got different levels of excitement, you know, and it's not a perfect room either."
9037720,9042200," So we're going to pick up any background noise from our AC and that sort of thing."
9042200,9045640," Listen to this guy blaming everyone but himself for our audio challenges."
9045640,9046640," Yeah."
9046640,9050400," Well, I'm thinking after today, you know, I was fixing some of those wrinkles."
9050400,9051960," I was looking at this setup here."
9051960,9053640," This just needs to go."
9053640,9055160," We need something else."
9055160,9060680," I'm going to fix this place and no more GoXLRs are going to be mentioned."
9060680,9061680," This is going to be-"
9061680,9062680," Really?"
9062680,9067520," This is going to be the best podcast set, live streaming set."
9067520,9068520," You heard it here."
9068520,9072080," I swear on Linus's life."
9072080,9073080," It's done."
9073080,9074080," I don't get it."
9074080,9075080," Wow."
9075080,9076080," Get it?"
9076080,9077080," Yeah, get it."
9077080,9078080," Okay."
9078080,9081520," I can make this good."
9081520,9083320," That camera is not anymore but that was very good."
9083320,9087200," If you guys could have seen that he was very enthusiastically pointing at the camera."
9087200,9091560," I just want it to be easy for everybody and not terrible and sound better."
9091560,9096080," Anyway, yes, I use two types of compressor and I'm still bad at this."
9096080,9100840," The MERSMET MERSCH message thing while on Android is a limitation of shop pay."
9100840,9104760," You were logged in and shop pay is your default selected option."
9104760,9109480," So it goes to shop pay and by going to shop pay it skips past that page if I remember"
9109480,9110640," correctly."
9110640,9117160," This is not something we can fix right now because it's not something we can fix at all"
9117160,9119560," until Shopify allows us to."
9119560,9121080," They are aware of the problem."
9121080,9125000," I doubt it's like the highest brownie thing because they're kind of a really big company"
9125000,9128400," and we're just one of their many partners."
9128400,9132080," But they know about it and they do seem to care and maybe eventually it'll be fine."
9132080,9137760," I think maybe check out extensions in the future will allow us to fix it or something."
9137760,9138760," I don't know."
9138760,9140640," It's been a long time since I've had that conversation."
9140640,9144720," All I know right now is there's not much we can do about it right now or maybe something"
9144720,9145720," recent allowed us to."
9145720,9146720," I don't know."
9146720,9147720," Last time we looked into we couldn't."
9147720,9148720," We've been working on the new theme."
9148720,9151240," The new theme is coming like real soon fast."
9151240,9154160," So once that's out, maybe we'll look back into those types of things."
9154160,9155160," This is so sweet."
9155160,9158200," I just got a message from Patrick Kennedy from Serve the Home."
9158200,9159600," Sorry for the late note."
9159600,9161520," Yeah, I'm still working."
9161520,9166000," Just wanted to say thank you for looking at me like I was a moron for not doing video"
9166000,9167920," on that walk in Taipei."
9167920,9170040," We just hit 100,000 subscribers."
9170040,9171040," It's been super fun."
9171040,9172040," Thanks for the inspiration."
9172040,9173040," Yeah, you bet, man."
9173040,9175640," I mean, you were video, man."
9175640,9176640," It's the way."
9176640,9177640," It's the way."
9177640,9179200," It's the way and they've been killing it over there."
9179200,9181040," They've been doing a great job."
9181040,9182040," More?"
9182040,9183520," Do you want more?"
9183520,9184520," I mean, we have more."
9184520,9185520," We got more."
9185520,9186520," This is from Christian."
9186520,9188240," Hey, guys, first time message."
9188240,9192440," I missed the start of the show, but so I don't know if you've covered it."
9192440,9196400," But what is your take on Mr. Who's the Boss video talking about Samsung batteries expanding?"
9196400,9197720," Good meeting to watch it."
9197720,9198720," I have no excuse."
9198720,9202400," I've just been busy this week."
9202400,9207120," What I've gathered so far from just people tweeting at me about it is that out of all"
9207120,9212440," the phones that he has kicking around, the Samsung ones are the ones that are swelling,"
9212440,9220640," I would really need to see a really big sample size of phones to really determine if it's"
9220640,9222480," a Samsung specific problem."
9222480,9228280," You got to understand Samsung also makes the batteries for a huge number of other phone"
9228280,9229360," makers."
9229360,9233880," So unless you're also seeing this pattern in other phones that have Samsung batteries"
9233880,9237520," in them, I don't know that I would read too much into it."
9237520,9243040," Another thing that I know is that I've seen the way that some YouTubers, I don't know"
9243040,9246920," how Aaron stores his phones, but I've seen the way some YouTubers store their phones"
9246920,9249720," and it's really bad."
9249720,9258920," Like just in a drawer or in boxes, in no particular charge state, it's really bad for them."
9258920,9263880," So leaving them plugged in all the time is bad, leaving them not plugged in for extremely"
9263880,9265640," long periods of time."
9265640,9267040," Also really bad."
9267040,9272760," Like these batteries, the way that they're built into these devices are designed for everyday"
9272760,9273760," use."
9273760,9279640," They're designed to be used every day or at least every few days and not just left in"
9279640,9284760," a particular charge state for long periods of time."
9284760,9291320," I don't know that I am able to form any kind of opinion on this at this point in time."
9291320,9296360," Do you know, partially because of that reason, there's emergency sat phones that are designed"
9296360,9302760," to run off of, I think it's double A batteries, but they have like some modern ability."
9302760,9305960," Like I think you can even get like maps and stuff."
9305960,9312120," Apparently he has a rack restorers of them, but are they somehow software controlled so"
9312120,9316080," that they're maintained at about 50% charge?"
9316080,9319840," Or are they left charged all the time?"
9319840,9321000," I don't know."
9321000,9322000," I don't know."
9322000,9324160," So I just would have to know a lot more."
9324160,9325160," I'm sorry guys."
9325160,9326480," I haven't watched the video yet."
9326480,9329040," So hard to comment when you haven't watched it."
9329040,9333280," Yeah, I do intend to watch it because this has absolutely been making the rounds."
9333280,9335080," Next up, got another one from Jeffrey."
9335080,9338040," I've been waiting for the chunk this bottle since it was first revealed."
9338040,9339040," Oh, sorry."
9339040,9340480," There was one last thing I wanted to say."
9340480,9345200," If you store a lithium battery incorrectly, it will swell."
9345200,9351080," So it's not like Samsung screwed up their batteries."
9351080,9353240," So I just, I can't speak to."
9353240,9354240," Well we'll see."
9354240,9358160," I've been waiting for the chunk this bottle."
9358160,9362920," Curious about how YouTube handles retention for videos watched at faster speeds."
9362920,9365360," I watch most things at one and a half times or faster."
9365360,9366720," And in word it hurts creators."
9366720,9367720," It does not."
9367720,9369000," It counts."
9369000,9374760," So if you watch at 2X, you, the creator gets the full watch time for the runtime of the"
9374760,9376320," video, whatever it is that you watched."
9376320,9378400," Yeah, I watch mostly everything at two times."
9378400,9382280," So that's one of my wife's things is she'll be reading comments on a video and she will"
9382280,9386760," always just let the video play at 2X with the volume down while she just reads comments"
9386760,9389320," and like, you can just get the creator studio app."
9389320,9391040," You don't have to like do it like this."
9391040,9394520," She's like, oh, every view counts."
9394520,9396880," Okay."
9396880,9398240," This is from Colton."
9398240,9402240," Luke, when did you begin your path as a software engineer?"
9402240,9406400," At what point in your tenure working with Linus, did you decide that that was your future"
9406400,9410320," path or was it something you were always working on in the background?"
9410320,9413560," It definitely wasn't while I was working with Linus."
9413560,9414800," It started."
9414800,9415800," I inspired him."
9415800,9416800," And I'm not."
9416800,9418600," With my software development skills."
9418600,9419600," It's your fault."
9419600,9420600," Yeah."
9420600,9421600," Yeah."
9421600,9422600," It's struggling with HTML."
9422600,9424640," Were you good at it?"
9424640,9425640," I don't remember."
9425640,9427040," There's something with HTML."
9427040,9428040," Yeah."
9428040,9431800," I probably was trying to like bold something and you were like, okay."
9431800,9432800," Yeah."
9432800,9434920," I remember something with HTML like really early on."
9434920,9438640," I don't remember what it was or what it was about."
9438640,9439640," Yeah."
9439640,9440640," I'm not by the way."
9440640,9443240," I lead a team of software developers."
9443240,9448200," But I became interested in software development really early on because my dad used to talk"
9448200,9453760," to me about it like way back in the day."
9453760,9456360," My dad was a plus certified super into computers all the time stuff."
9456360,9462520," He used to talk to me about old like punch card programming stuff."
9462520,9467080," I remember he almost tried to like scare me away from it at one point because he wanted"
9467080,9469480," me to like be sure that I was actually interested."
9469480,9475200," And he talked to me about the old type of debugging that they used to have to do back"
9475200,9476200," the day."
9476200,9478280," It used to be brutal."
9478280,9481760," And I had the very good experience of looking into more modern development at that time and"
9481760,9484960," realizing that it wasn't as bad as it used to be when he had looked into it back in the"
9484960,9486800," day."
9486800,9494360," But yeah, I was interested from a very early age and I started delving into it in like right"
9494360,9495960," at the beginning of high school."
9495960,9499440," There's a couple of other people in my grade that were also interested."
9499440,9503360," So I had some people to bounce off of, which was cool."
9503360,9510360," My computer teacher, Mr. Tritall, I believe he's still, I think he's the principal of"
9510360,9512640," a school now."
9512640,9514000," But he was awesome."
9514000,9516800," I'm not surprised that his career advanced because he was fantastic."
9516800,9520960," He was very accommodating to me wanting to push further and drive more."
9520960,9526480," I got the award for the top grade in computers 12 when I was in grade 10, which was sweet"
9526480,9531560," because he let me like, I completed the entire curriculum for some computer class in like"
9531560,9532880," a couple of weeks."
9532880,9536720," So he let me just take the next one with the rest of that semester and then I completed"
9536720,9538240," that one."
9538240,9542000," So he like gave me some extra work and then the next semester we did like the same thing"
9542000,9547480," and we just stacked a bunch of courses into other ones and I ended up doing like, he let"
9547480,9552560," me like build my own computers curriculum while I was there because he knew I was just"
9552560,9556960," very interested and he wanted to support that and I really, really deeply appreciated that."
9556960,9562960," And that's a huge reason why I went down that career path was because I was very particular"
9562960,9564880," about like supportive teachers."
9564880,9568400," I tended to do really well in those classes and unsuored teachers."
9568400,9573080," I tended to do really poorly in those classes."
9573080,9576920," He even, I don't know, I'm turning this into a thing about him."
9576920,9581520," I don't know why, but he knew there was a bunch of kids in my grade that were really"
9581520,9584560," interested in computers and software development stuff."
9584560,9591640," So if I remember correctly, this story, he went to BCIT himself for a summer semester"
9591640,9597440," and came back and took what he learned there and created a new course for us, which was"
9597440,9600240," 3D game development."
9600240,9604320," And in that semester, we learned way more advanced development stuff than we could have"
9604320,9605320," otherwise."
9605320,9610240," We made actual games and our final project of the course was to submit a game that had"
9610240,9614320," like projectile physics and all this type of stuff going and taught us all this stuff."
9614320,9615880," Really, really cool."
9615880,9621840," And that like just made me so much more interested and I kept pursuing it and then ended up"
9621840,9625400," dropping it to make YouTube and then ended up picking it up again to make a floatplane."
9625400,9627040," And then I don't know."
9627040,9628040," There you go."
9628040,9631280," Did you notice half the floatplane chat is staff right now?"
9631280,9632880," I think Tynan's in there."
9632880,9635480," It looks like Jake from Labs is in there."
9635480,9637960," I see AJ in there."
9637960,9639560," Dan, Dan, are you in there?"
9639560,9641520," Yeah, I'm not a mod."
9641520,9642520," You're not a mod."
9642520,9644480," Okay, we should probably get that all sorted out."
9644480,9647880," Message, don't you guys have like other things to do?"
9647880,9651800," I mean, it's almost 10 p.m."
9651800,9653360," Joe's hanging out."
9653360,9656120," It's the only way we could find things out about the company."
9656120,9658720," So it's like this is our weekly newsletter."
9658720,9661920," Oh, hey, we're starting this thing called Labs."
9661920,9664400," Hey, look, we canceled Labs."
9664400,9667160," We didn't cancel Labs."
9667160,9668160," We didn't cancel Labs."
9668160,9669160," Change the name."
9669160,9671160," I didn't know there was a Christmas party."
9671160,9672160," Awesome."
9672160,9673160," There he is."
9673160,9674160," All right."
9674160,9677720," Oh, I had a couple of questions from people in floatplane chat though."
9677720,9679480," I was having a look at it."
9679480,9684840," I was asked about the Logitech Brio scandal that random Frank P posted about."
9684840,9690880," I have not had a chance to watch the video, but it sounds like it's something pretty sketchy."
9690880,9693040," So you guys should go check that out."
9693040,9695200," Or I don't know, maybe it's a bad video."
9695200,9696200," Probably isn't a bad video."
9696200,9697920," So yeah, you guys should go check that out."
9697920,9701320," It comes right on the heels of, I actually had asked for this to be included in the"
9701320,9704360," WAN Show Doc this week, but it's not here."
9704360,9709240," Comes on the heels of us finding out Logitech was being kind of sketchy about user reviews"
9709240,9711600," of their cloud gaming device."
9711600,9718240," So what happened after the show was it was found that my positive review with lots of"
9718240,9721000," stars went through no problem."
9721000,9726120," So it was reviewed and ultimately was submitted to the site or was posted on the site."
9726120,9730240," And my more balanced two star review was not posted."
9730240,9736240," So whatever curation process was taking place, we demonstrated that more stars were going"
9736240,9740840," through and less stars were not, which really raises a lot of questions about Logitech's"
9740840,9745000," transparency and the way that they curate user reviews on their site because they're"
9745000,9749840," not really useful if they're just only positive, are they?"
9749840,9756760," Then what happened is all of the reviews were wiped except for my two star review for"
9756760,9758400," a bit."
9758400,9762440," Then like the next day, all the reviews were pulled and they formally said, \"Oh, we're"
9762440,9766240," not putting reviews on this page because this thing isn't even out yet.\""
9766240,9767240," Fishy."
9767240,9770880," Yeah, that doesn't really fix the problem."
9770880,9771880," No."
9771880,9776840," And you haven't really addressed what you guys are doing with reviews on other product pages,"
9776840,9778120," for example."
9778120,9783040," One quick thing, just because I think there's some of this happening right now, if you are"
9783040,9789240," staff and you are staff, like in Flowplane Chat, email support@flowplane.com from your"
9789240,9791880," official work email that is the only way to do it."
9791880,9793880," I just used Linus' account."
9793880,9794880," No."
9794880,9796440," Don't do that."
9796440,9797440," Yeah, no, we don't."
9797440,9798840," It's not actually my account."
9798840,9803800," It's the name and chat that was just Linus."
9803800,9806400," So everyone always thinks it's you, which is also a problem."
9806400,9807560," That's very problematic."
9807560,9808560," Yes."
9808560,9809880," More merch messages?"
9809880,9812960," Razor apparently also has a competitor to it."
9812960,9813960," So..."
9813960,9814960," What?"
9814960,9816760," I guess that's something."
9816760,9817760," Yeah."
9817760,9820240," I don't know."
9820240,9823960," But they're really focused on like cellular?"
9823960,9827520," So expensive."
9827520,9829400," And worse in everyone?"
9829400,9831640," Okay, cool."
9831640,9834560," Yeah, I like ours Technica's headline here."
9834560,9837840," \"Razors making a streaming focused handheld console for some reason.\""
9837840,9839720," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
9839720,9841720," That's super legit."
9841720,9842720," Oh man."
9842720,9843720," Yikes."
9843720,9846480," I like it."
9846480,9849920," Frank's video title is Spicy."
9849920,9850920," What is it?"
9850920,9854440," Frank is lying in all caps to us."
9854440,9855440," To us."
9855440,9856440," Whoo!"
9856440,9857440," Whoo!"
9857440,9858440," I gotta watch that."
9858440,9859440," That's interesting."
9859440,9864200," Okay, you want another one?"
9864200,9867400," What product has the highest margins on the LTT store?"
9867400,9869160," So I know what to buy next."
9869160,9872360," Also, will you have four XL hoodies, T-shirts for us?"
9872360,9873480," Bigger folks in the future."
9873480,9874800," Yes, we will."
9874800,9876000," We are working on that."
9876000,9880000," I know it's taking longer than we'd like, but we are working on it."
9880000,9885360," Now that we've got our big 50,000 T-shirt order of the standard sizes, we can turn our"
9885360,9887360," attention to our extended sizes."
9887360,9891240," We want to do Husky Boy, Lanky Boy, smaller and bigger."
9891240,9892960," So that's a goal."
9892960,9896480," I know I've been talking about it a long time, but it's taken us a long time to get our own"
9896480,9897480," shirt lengths going."
9897480,9901680," They're really good though, I'm really happy with them, but it takes time."
9901680,9905400," As for what product has the highest margins, you can buy gift cards and then never redeem"
9905400,9906400," them."
9906400,9907400," Oh, yeah."
9907400,9908400," Well, that's true."
9908400,9909400," Genius."
9909400,9910400," Cut them up."
9910400,9914080," If you just want to send a donation, hey, we're more than happy to take it."
9914080,9916720," And then if you ever change your mind, you can buy something on the store."
9916720,9917720," Win-win."
9917720,9918720," That's fair enough."
9918720,9922280," Someone in chat said, \"This might be more for the Asian market."
9922280,9927080," My family is from Taiwan and they primarily use cellular data even for home stream and"
9927080,9928080," computers.\""
9928080,9930680," And I have heard of that."
9930680,9932240," Okay."
9932240,9934240," But like for gaming?"
9934240,9935240," Yeah."
9935240,9936240," This is the thing."
9936240,9937240," I've heard of this before."
9937240,9938240," But like multiplayer gaming?"
9938240,9939240," Yeah."
9939240,9940240," It's totally a thing."
9940240,9941240," I mean, I hear you're late."
9941240,9945480," Some people even have like cell boosters and stuff and their cell setups there are just"
9945480,9947240," like better than what we have."
9947240,9948240," Yeah."
9948240,9949240," I mean, maybe it makes sense."
9949240,9951600," Population density, tiny island versus Canada."
9951600,9952600," Yeah."
9952600,9957440," I mean, okay."
9957440,9960840," I'm not into it, but like maybe that's why Razer is doing it."
9960840,9961840," I don't know."
9961840,9967080," They do have the like actual in location, Razer store in Taiwan, stuff like that."
9967080,9968080," Yeah."
9968080,9971120," Glad you enjoyed the video, Solar Daddy."
9971120,9972560," Watch the fight video."
9972560,9977640," Says it's incredible, most underrated video this year."
9977640,9978640," It's good."
9978640,9979640," Heck yeah."
9979640,9981600," By the way, there were a couple things I had intended to reply to last week."
9981600,9983360," I put them in a notepad doc here."
9983360,9987800," Captain said, said, \"Are you going to do a 2022 update on how you guys make money?\""
9987800,9988800," I was thinking about it."
9988800,9992800," I felt like it might be a little soon, but it's changed a lot."
9992800,9995200," It still feels like it's soon, even though it's changed a lot."
9995200,9996200," Yeah."
9996200,9997520," But it's changed a lot."
9997520,9998720," It's really different."
9998720,10000200," So I don't know."
10000200,10005920," If the idea of the series is that people know how we make money, right now they don't."
10005920,10007400," Fair enough."
10007400,10016120," And then Nipless Cage said, \"Seriously though, if you want a chance to go on the merch message"
10016120,10019600," list, you have to buy early, but you don't get the deals till the middle of the stream."
10019600,10020600," I hate it."
10020600,10021600," That's not true."
10021600,10023120," It doesn't matter when you buy."
10023120,10028000," You're selected based on what the producer decides to curate and all the curated ones"
10028000,10029000," we do do.\""
10029000,10033440," A lot of questions that don't get curated might be really good, but we might have answered"
10033440,10034440," them last week."
10034440,10035440," Yeah."
10035440,10037920," And so you might just get a text reply and it might show up down here."
10037920,10039520," So you just got to kind of watch for it."
10039520,10040520," Sorry."
10040520,10041520," We're doing our best with it."
10041520,10044640," Or we get like 40 at the same time and I've had finger one of them."
10044640,10046080," Got to pick one of them or that."
10046080,10047080," Yeah."
10047080,10050720," Which is why we like merch messages so much because then if we don't reply to it, at least"
10050720,10052120," you get your order in the mail."
10052120,10053120," Yeah."
10053120,10055720," Last one, I guess."
10055720,10056720," Okay."
10056720,10057720," Yeah."
10057720,10058720," Let's do it."
10058720,10060520," This is from Bill."
10060520,10066160," Hovercraft.com, a project startup from LMG like Flowplane, but instead of video streaming,"
10066160,10067880," it's a cloud gaming service."
10067880,10071000," Maybe start off with retro or public domain games first, then AAA games."
10071000,10072240," How did this get curated?"
10072240,10073240," No."
10073240,10074240," It wasn't me."
10074240,10075240," That was me."
10075240,10076240," I just met some of it."
10076240,10077760," They're going to blame me."
10077760,10080840," I don't want more insanely difficult projects."
10080840,10085760," I would like some softballs for the development team."
10085760,10088320," You could get a real CDN like Azure."
10088320,10089320," Yeah."
10089320,10094360," Let's take an absolutely mini school size team and make one of the hardest possible things"
10094360,10095640," you can do on the internet."
10095640,10099400," And also, let's not use the cloud services because those are expensive and they restrict"
10099400,10100400," you."
10100400,10101680," At least we won't cancel it."
10101680,10102680," That's true."
10102680,10103880," That we're still around."
10103880,10106360," You cancel it when Flowplane goes under."
10106360,10107360," Never."
10107360,10108360," It can't sink."
10108360,10109360," It's in the name."
10109360,10110360," It's in the name."
10110360,10112720," Oh, it could flip over."
10112720,10113720," Nope."
10113720,10117680," You put all the CDN weight on one side."
10117680,10119720," Hardware costs on the same side."
10119720,10123520," Well, it may cost on the other side of Kate's balance."
10123520,10124520," Yeah."
10124520,10125520," Okay."
10125520,10126520," There's two more."
10126520,10127520," We might as well just do them."
10127520,10130680," Anonymous asks, \"Would you happen to know why NVIDIA is charging so much in Australia?\""
10130680,10139200," The 49e converts from USD to $2,400, but it's actually $2,900."
10139200,10141320," So, it's a combination of things."
10141320,10146040," It's resellers taking advantage of that Australians are used to paying more for things"
10146040,10148280," and taking more margin in all likelihood."
10148280,10151360," Whether that's distributors, whether that's the actual retailers, I couldn't tell you,"
10151360,10154840," but I pretty much guarantee you there's some of that happening."
10154840,10158880," And then NVIDIA is probably playing that game too."
10158880,10159880," A lot of the time..."
10159880,10161040," They're also like import taxes."
10161040,10165640," There can also be import taxes and tariffs that are not the fault of the manufacturers."
10165640,10170640," So it could be some combination of those three would be my best guess."
10170640,10172840," I'm going to archive that now."
10172840,10176920," And finally, Tyler D asks, \"Y'all mentioned dev jobs earlier?"
10176920,10178400," Are you interested in newer graduates?"
10178400,10181640," I have over a year of dev experience and think working with you guys is a dream job."
10181640,10183320," Well, it's harder than you think for one thing."
10183320,10185200," We're not like this fun all the time."
10185200,10189800," We're not actually really taking many applications right now."
10189800,10195520," I do have a position on the team now that is supposed to be more of a transitionary positionary"
10195520,10197960," position, which is a junior position."
10197960,10202080," The idea is that you come in, work as a junior, eventually we push you forward onto other"
10202080,10205880," projects and then the next person comes into that slot."
10205880,10209120," But the person filling that position is newly in that position."
10209120,10210120," So..."
10210120,10211120," There's amazing."
10211120,10212120," I have to wait some time."
10212120,10217920," Jake from the lab is particularly passionate about Stadia."
10217920,10220760," I don't think he was in the chat while we were discussing it earlier."
10220760,10225040," But he's like, \"As someone who tested Stadia extensively, it had the absolute without question,"
10225040,10227000," platform technology wise.\""
10227000,10228600," And you know what?"
10228600,10230600," That's a super good point."
10230600,10232520," But it's Google, man."
10232520,10233960," Yeah, the trust isn't there."
10233960,10235960," Yeah, just that sucks."
10235960,10236960," It sucks."
10236960,10237960," It sucks they did this."
10237960,10238960," They killed something really cool."
10238960,10241360," And then we're like, \"Well, forget it!\""
10241360,10242360," I completely believe him."
10242360,10244200," As far as my understanding with the tech was fantastic."
10244200,10251320," The problem is that the Red Dead player, 6,000 hours into Red Dead, and it's gone now."
10251320,10254040," You can't trust them with this type of stuff."
10254040,10258400," Like, we never at any point said Stadia was bad tech, you know?"
10258400,10263680," And so I get why people are so frustrated and passionate about it."
10263680,10265560," It's just Google doing Google things, man."
10265560,10267600," It sucks."
10267600,10269640," And I think that's pretty much it for the show today."
10269640,10270840," I think it's gotta be."
10270840,10271840," Thanks for watching."
10271840,10273560," We will see you again next week."
10273560,10275100," Same bad time."
10275100,10276100," Same bad channel."
10276100,10277600," I'm going to bed."
10277600,10278600," Bye!"
10278600,10279600," Yeah, I hear you."
10279600,10281160," Oh wait, I'm not supposed to do this, right?"
10281160,10282160," No."
10282160,10283160," Can I do it?"
10283160,10286920," Oh, so then you could."
10286920,10288760," Yeah, I guess."
10288760,10290760," But you might as well just do it through here and get used to it."
10290760,10291760," Because that's where I'm supposed to do it."
10291760,10292760," Oh, I'm supposed to do it for me."
10292760,10293760," Or do this or this."
10293760,10294760," Oh, there's an incoming one."
10294760,10297000," Holy cats, you guys are still going mad props."
10297000,10299000," Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
10299000,10300000," I'm just going to run it."
10300000,10301000," I'm going to run it."
10301000,10302000," No, I archived."
10302000,10303000," I'm running it."
10303000,10304000," Run it."
10304000,10305000," Oh, God."
10305000,10306000," Oh, there was one."
10306000,10307000," Thanks, Adam H."
10307000,10308920," Oh, yeah, because that's not how the Q works."
10308920,10309920," I don't know."
10309920,10312160," Yeah, so we always have to run it through here."
10312160,10314560," Adam, I'm sorry, Carter Adam."
10314560,10315560," I'm just tired."
10315560,10316560," OK."
10316560,10317560," OK, Luke."
10317560,10318560," OK."
10318560,10320360," I'm not apologizing to you."
10320360,10322360," I'm apologizing to Carter."
10322360,10325680," Yeah, nobody's sorry to you."
10325680,10327680," This is all your fault."
10327680,10330560," He's the compressor, isn't it?"
10330560,10331920," All right, good night, y'all."
10331920,10332560," Bye."
10332560,10334980," (buzzing)"
