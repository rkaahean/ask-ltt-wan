0,6320," What is up y'all? Welcome to the Wanshow. We've got a fantastic show lined up for you"
6320,16680," this week. Our main topics of discussion are going to be what is USB 4 2.0? I didn't want"
16680,26000," to know. That is not how versioning version numbering works. And also LTT has actually"
26000,35600," completed. It is shot now. We have completed our first major, like big sponsorship of an"
35600,42920," S tier YouTuber. Yeah. We do sponsorships for other YouTubers now. So I'm going to be"
42920,49840," talking about that. What else we got today? That's wacky. What isn't wacky is Ryzen 7000"
49840,56280," Intel trying to say that, you know, Arc is better than Nvidia ray tracing. They have"
56280,61240," never claimed anything in the past that ended up being skewed. So I'm sure this is purely"
61240,69080," accurate."
69080,90520," So, the Roger B. Squarespace vulture and secret lab. All right. I think the first thing we're"
90520,97240," going to have to dig into this week is, oh, the slightly different format for the show."
97240,102800," I'm really hungry and Bell's hungry and Luke was indifferent. So we ordered food. So we're"
102800,107360," going to get through our tech picks a little bit faster. And we're going to save our merch"
107360,111880," messages for a little bit later in the show. So if you guys haven't picked up a screwdriver"
111880,116440," or backpack or an RGB hoodie or short circuit hoodie, like the one I'm wearing or anything"
116440,121600," else that's on the store. And you wanted to order one now and send in a merch message."
121600,125520," Bell's going to be curating everything throughout the show, but we're going to get to them later."
125520,129240," We're going to push them a little bit further out, which means we are going to jump right"
129240,138600," into USB 4 2.0. That's right, ladies and gentlemen, the USB, what is it, USB forum,"
138600,145800," USB promoter group. Can you they have they're on a mission. They're on a mission to make"
145800,152600," me angry because there is no other possible reason that I can imagine for this naming scheme"
152600,158760," to exist. This is not how versioning works. If you like to think, I like to think that"
158760,166520," someone there knows that and is driving for change, but this one time was like actually,"
166520,172480," we need this sequence of numbers and they made it happen. What they wanted for 20. What"
172480,173320," do you even Oh my God."
173320,184040," Well, then they just made it version 4.20. And even that would have been stupid because"
184040,190880," it appears to be a pretty significant upgrade from 40 gigabit per second to 80 gigabit per"
190880,195160," second to be clear. I am not upset about the technology."
195160,200080," It sounds actually like really solid. You do need an active cable for that for that 80"
200080,206320," gigabit per second. It's it's max on passive is 40 gigabit, but that's still still pretty"
206320,212280," crazy. It's only USB type C, which is what's going to happen matter of time. Yeah, matter"
212280,220200," of time. Yeah. I'm so angry. It includes new features such as a bandwidth boost beyond"
220200,225120," 20 gigabit per second for USB 3.2 data tunneling when using alt mode, such as display port"
225120,228920," mode and has been updated to feature the latest versions of the display port standard"
228920,235400," and PCIE spec, which remember is important because USB 4 is now essentially Thunderbolt,"
235400,239800," which was able to carry PCIE connections. That's how you can hook up an external GPU"
239800,244200," and stuff like that. It is backwards compatible with previous revisions, including the original"
244200,251880," USB 4 standard, which has barely even made it to life at this point. Yeah, USB 3.2, USB"
251880,258560," 2.0 and Thunderbolt 3. And our discussion question is faster is always better. But why do they"
258560,262960," keep using these confusing naming schemes? I might have an answer for that. I'm going"
262960,268320," to have to try to dig it up. Capes in float plane chat says that the USB spec naming is"
268320,274920," meant for developers and not consumers and that we should refer to Benson Leungs. Hopefully"
274920,282880," I said that right. Response in the USB C hardware. USB C hardware subreddit. I legitimately"
282880,290680," almost said chardware. Names. Sorry. What? Hold on a second. Hold on a second. All right,"
290680,296860," Benson. I don't like that. I don't see why developers need a worse naming scheme. I would"
296860,303440," like to try to find this thread. Can someone post? I think I've probably got it. USB promoter"
303440,310880," group announces USB 4. This is great. That's it. It has 163 comments and 48 upvotes. That's"
310880,320200," usually a good sign. The top up. Oh, this is great. I don't want to log in. I don't"
320200,326560," care. I found I found the post. USB does have branding professionals. Hint. This announcement"
326560,331720," is about a spec version bump, which is a technical document, not a branding document. Here's what"
331720,345080," my guess is on the Browning will be for gear with the new speed. USB for 80 gigabit per"
345080,360040," second. Why USB 4 2.0? Why not USB 5? Why not USB 4.1? Why not? Literally anything else."
360040,368200," Like there is there is no continuity whatsoever. We had USB 1. Then we got 1.1. If I recall"
368200,377920," there was a 1.1 a hold on all the versions of USB. Here we go. Okay. 1.1. Okay. 1.0 apparently"
377920,381880," was like never really a thing. This is from Triplet though. So I have no idea how accurate"
381880,387200," this is. You. Oh my God. Where did you show me the table? Okay. So we got here we go. Here"
387200,395800," we go. Triplet provides this this chart. 1.1. This was full speed USB introduced in 1998."
395800,400640," All right. You had your USB a you had your USB b that was for your scanner. All right."
400640,404960," We had scanners back then. Okay. That was that was a peripheral. We had our printers."
404960,412320," We had our scanners combine them. Black magic. Not till later. Okay. Then we had USB 2 high"
412320,420480," speed. Who would think what would you think is faster? High speed or full speed? Help"
420480,428660," me out here, Luke. Full speed? Yeah. I would think so too. Maximum. Unfortunately full"
428660,434240," speed is like 140th the speed of high speed. Yeah. Okay. Whatever. Came a mere two years"
434240,441280," later. So yeah, it went a lot faster and that merited a, you know, a spec bump. Okay. Then"
441280,447160," we went from 480 megabit per second. Okay. So we six X the excuse me, 10 X to the speed"
447160,454880," again to five gigabit. And that was in 2008, whopping eight years later. This was USB 3.0,"
454880,464040," which I think has since been renamed to 3.1 gen one super speed. Okay. Then things get"
464040,473760," really messy. USB 3.1 doubled the speed over USB 3.0 and was originally called USB 3.1."
473760,483880," Then it was changed to USB 3.1 gen two super speed plus. Holy ****. Okay. Then, then we"
483880,493040," got USB 3.2 super speed, which I think is yes. Now called USB 3.2 gen two by two. Oh,"
493040,497480," no, right. No, no, no. These were former names, right? Gen one. Now it's USB 3.2 gen one."
497480,503440," Okay. 3.2 gen two by two. And that's 20 gigabit per second. I really enjoyed that one. I remember"
503440,511400," that launch. Oh my God. Oh, so we got USB four, which was also known as USB 4 gen 2 by 2 or"
511400,517360," USB 4 20 gigabit. Wait, what 20 gigabit? I thought. Oh my God. Okay. So USB 4, this"
517360,523000," is where things get really complicated because USB 4 has optional components to the spec."
523000,528120," You don't have to. You can be USB 4 without being 40 gigabit per second. So here we've"
528120,533160," got USB 4 20 gigabit. Okay. So that came in 2019 does up to 20 gigabit. Then we got"
533160,541320," USB 4, which is gen three by two, which does 40 gigabit and might also do like PCIe and"
541320,552360," stuff, assuming you have a compliant cable. All of this was preventable. There's some,"
552360,560920," there's some posts actually in response to tech linked. So laughing man or Benson Leung,"
560920,566360," the person that we're finding comments from and stuff, responded to a tech linked Twitter"
566360,572880," post, a tweet, some would say. And there are more comments from him on the Reddit thread."
572880,578040," There's, there's a few different comments on Reddit. They're all saying roughly the same"
578040,588840," thing. Where's the other one? The main thing is what I kind of already said though on Twitter."
588840,593480," Someone responded to tech linked by saying Ben Mitchell responded to tech linked by saying,"
593480,598960," Oh my God, can they just stick to the naming scheme, please and stop renaming old standards?"
598960,604400," Benson Leung also known as laughing man said, no, because people and then in brackets, developers,"
604400,608880," spec writers and others work on these spec documents. These are living standards and"
608880,615080," having a sensible version numbering scheme is required. Someone responded to that by"
615080,621920," saying this is not a sensible version numbering scheme, which got 23 likes. He responded."
621920,626240," Luke, with the play by play here. All right. The likes are the likes are interesting. The"
626240,630680," tech linked post got a bunch of likes. The first response gets 68. Benson responds gets"
630680,635400," three. Someone go up by the way, can one person go like that? 68 one? Thanks. Nice. Yeah, perfect."
635400,643760," Brice response gets 23. Benson responds again gets two. So, okay, that isn't that doesn't mean"
643760,649840," he's right or anything. It's just or wrong. People aren't happy about it. He says it absolutely"
649840,655120," is in reference to not a sensible version numbering scheme. He says the USB developers"
655120,663840," announced the version 1.0 release of the USB 4 spec. Oh, in 2019. Sorry, I missed that"
663840,669120," part. Three years have passed and a new version is about to be released based on the same USB"
669120,677960," 4 technologies. It makes sense to go from version 1.0 to 2.0. But if it's the same USB"
677960,692280," 4 technologies, then why the actual living is it not just USB 4.1? Yep. Yep. You know,"
692280,698960," like how you did it before. Yep. Remember that USB promoter group? Remember when you"
698960,704520," did that? Remember when USB 3.0 became USB 3.1 because it was based on the same underlying"
704520,709920," technology but made it go more faster and had some new features. Do you remember that?"
709920,714440," I also don't even mind multiple decimal points. Have you seen that in some versioning? Yeah."
714440,721280," They'll do like major, minor micro or whatever. I'd rather have a letter at that point personally."
721280,726600," Display port style. The pro. Okay. Display port has made some mistakes though. If I recall"
726600,735480," correctly, no, HDMI has done it. HDMI 1.0 something B was like a huge upgrade from, because really,"
735480,744120," okay. If it's going to end up facing the consumer, you can't just wash your hands of it and go,"
744120,747960," well, this is intended for developers. It's not my fault that consumers are confused."
747960,754840," He's saying it won't. What? Of course it will. He said it. It always does. I agree."
756200,762840," I'm just making sure that I say his arguments. He's saying that it won't and shouldn't,"
762840,767560," because there will be official branding and that official branding is USB 4, 80 gigabit per second."
767560,774200," Or 80 gigabit. The problem is that that's not what's going to end up being presented. For sure."
774200,782520," Yeah. And like meanwhile, you've got the HDMI group actively making it harder to tell what is"
782520,789240," implemented on a product. You've got the USB group adding ambiguity layers on top of ambiguity"
789240,798120," layers, okay, with optional parts of the specification and no clear actual line in the sand for what"
798120,806440," qualifies as USB number point number. So someone just said what I was trying to say better. It's"
806440,811880," called semantic versioning and it goes major minor patch. I actually, I've never minded that,"
811880,818760," personally. Sure. Because you could have like, okay, so let's use Windows who have not done a good"
818760,824280," job of this, but let's use Windows. Let's say we're on Windows 15. So you have Windows 15. That's"
824280,829160," your first number 15. Sure. Dot. Then you have major version releases. Well, why don't we just"
829160,836360," use a Windows that used this? Windows 3.1. Yeah. Yeah. So major updates is the point one. And then"
836360,841080," any little tiny fixes, whatever they can get slammed under at the very bottom decimal point."
841080,845000," Sure. No one really cares, but they're there because they matter. Right. But like the average"
845000,850440," users aren't going to care. And that's completely fine. That works for, I've never really seen anyone"
850440,855640," complain about that naming scheme. I'm not saying it's the best. I'm not saying it's the most"
855640,861560," marketable, whatever, but it works. It's very fun. What's marketable is what can be understood"
861560,869320," from my point of view. It should describe at least like, okay, you can criticize Intel all day"
869320,874840," for their opaque processor numbering schemes, especially once you make your way out of the,"
874840,880440," like the mainline enthusiast skews into some of the weird low power stuff or some of the embedded"
880440,889560," stuff that they do. But at least every digit has mostly some kind of meaning to it. Like you could,"
889560,897640," if you had a legend, you could interpret it, right? Whereas USB just has no clear,"
897640,906920," it just has no, like, well, going from three to four didn't have a speed increase. Okay. It"
906920,912200," didn't even have an interface change. They're both USB C. So what was the difference? I mean,"
912200,917960," I know the difference. There were a lot of technological innovations between USB three and USB four."
918600,925400," But then why did you allow this half half ass implementation that wasn't 40 gigabit per second"
925400,933960," for USB four? Like I just, I'm struggling here. I'm struggling. As long as it's consistent,"
933960,940840," I can kind of get behind it. But any other time it really does feel like you are,"
940840,948840," you are confusing consumers for a reason. Like, you know, when, oh man, like you'll see,"
948840,954680," you'll see like a GPU maker go from three digit numbers to four digit numbers when,"
954680,959160," and you particularly see these things happen when they don't have anything particularly"
959160,966280," innovative to show. Yeah. There is, there is some people, I want to make sure I'm defending"
966920,971480," Benson the young right now because there are some people saying like, oh, they like they promised"
971480,977560," or they said that it would be USB four, eight gigabit per second. They're still saying that."
977560,985000," And he's still saying that that's going to be the marketing or branding version. This weird one"
985000,992280," that I already forgot, USB four version 2.0 is a theoretically a developer only branding thing."
992280,999080," The problem with this is it's not only has it already hit a lot of consumers, but it's going"
999080,1004200," to hit many more and will very likely be a part of the branding of certain products."
1004200,1013000," So, because companies are going to start designing, developing, planning these products like now."
1013000,1019400," And they're just not going to get updated. We've seen it happen a ton of times."
1019400,1024920," So, yeah, I'm really frustrated. Let's move on. No, that's just enough being angry."
1024920,1029720," Do you want to talk about Japan declared war on floppy disks or?"
1029720,1034360," This is actually pretty interesting. Japan declares war on floppy disks. Japan's digital"
1034360,1040440," minister Taro Kono has declared war on floppy disks and other retro tech used by the country's"
1040440,1047640," bureaucrats. Japan still has roughly 1900 government procedures that require the use of disks,"
1047640,1055000," including floppy disks, CDs, mini disks. That was very surprised to see many disks on here."
1055000,1061080," I know, right? Kind of awesome. The US government had had been using floppy disks as recently as"
1061080,1068120," 2019 to receive nuclear launch orders from the president. That is awesome."
1068120,1072920," To be clear, I'm not suggesting that it's on the internet."
1075080,1079560," I'm just saying we could do something a little more robust than floppy disks."
1079560,1081960," That's OK. I just want to make that very clear."
1081960,1087400," More than 20,000 typical disks would be needed to replicate an average memory stick"
1087400,1093000," storing 32 gigabytes of information. This is pretty epic. You guys did a video fairly recently"
1093000,1095800," building like a Windows 98 machine."
1095800,1100440," We bought it. Oh, you bought one? Yeah, there's a vendor online that sells"
1101240,1109640," Windows 98 computers for a brand. Yeah. Yeah. They have new manufactured hardware and stuff."
1109640,1114920," No. Oh, I thought they did. No, they just, well, they might have some, but a lot of it is refurbished."
1114920,1118920," That makes sense. Yeah, because there's a lot of it out there and it costs nothing,"
1118920,1124360," but what cost is spending the time to validate it and make sure that it's all working and ready"
1124360,1131080," for deployment because as Anthony explained in the video, there are many industries that still"
1131080,1138120," rely on extremely old soft parts of manufacturing and stuff where like it does as much as this might"
1138120,1142840," annoy some people and like software development and stuff, what they have does enough in a lot"
1142840,1148360," of these situations. 300 megahertz, a lot of that's millions of cycles a second. Like it's"
1148360,1153400," actually fine. In a lot of very specific situations, you know, running a conveyor belt."
1153400,1160840," Yeah. Who cares? Yeah. It's fine. Yep. And the cost of updating that hardware that"
1160840,1167080," it's running is monumental. It could be could potentially be catastrophic depending on the size"
1167080,1176040," of the business. Like so compared to updating this giant, this giant kind of machine or whatever it"
1176040,1182120," is, you know, just going out and buying another Windows 98 computer, even if you are being charged"
1182120,1188280," an obscene amount of money for it. Sure. Makes business sense. It's an obscene amount of money"
1188280,1193400," for what you're getting, but it's still a grand, which to individuals is going to seem like a lot"
1193400,1197480," to a company that's churning out millions of dollars worth of product every day. And they need"
1197480,1203960," that freaking machine running isn't going to be a huge expense. It is amazing how different the"
1203960,1211000," calculations for the worth, wildness of a purchase are for a business compared to a consumer. See,"
1211000,1214280," I was even talking about, okay, what if you're a smaller business and you just can't afford to"
1214280,1218040," update the machinery? That's one way of thinking about it. But then Luke's like, well, what if"
1218040,1221800," what if they're churning out millions of dollars worth of equipment? Well, then they're clearly not"
1221800,1226920," starving for money, but let's talk about opportunity cost. Yeah. What if they had to turn off that"
1226920,1231960," machinery for some period of time in order to perform this this maintenance to upgrade it so"
1231960,1238120," that it can run Windows Vista or so it can run Windows 10 or whatever the case may be. What is"
1238120,1245640," it costing them to have that not running? So it could be literally, it could be hundreds of thousands"
1245640,1250840," or millions of dollars to turn it off and upgrade it versus what I just spend a grand and I can go"
1250840,1259320," get a new Windows 98 computer. It's wild, right? And so as much as it feels counterintuitive for,"
1259320,1265800," you know, as an 80s, 90s kid, right? I feel like Japan is like the land of technology."
1267000,1273880," That's the kind of the brand that Japan has to me, right? You know, the first time that I ever saw"
1273880,1279560," a USB thumb drive, it was a friend bringing it back, I believe from the trip to Japan. Yeah,"
1279560,1284760," or the first time I saw a mini disc, oh, it's Sony. You know, Sony was like the premium,"
1284760,1291720," the premium right? Samsung and LG were still like lucky gold star, like cheap crap, right? Nobody"
1291720,1297400," respected those brands back then. Japan, the land of video games and technology and like,"
1297400,1308040," so for me to read that the Japanese government is still using flop. I mean, CDs, oh, okay, fair"
1308040,1314840," enough, I guess, but mini disc, mini disc was never even you. Like, I wasn't even aware of it"
1315560,1322680," as a medium for anything other than, you know, listening to MP3's off Napster, right? Like,"
1322680,1329000," that was the only thing I ever knew it to exist for. And it was also very common back then for"
1329000,1333480," certain, I mean, it still is common, but not on the same scale, I would argue because the"
1333480,1337640," internet has connected people very closely, but it's very common back then for certain technologies"
1337640,1343160," to actually take off in certain areas. So maybe mini disc was just used for other stuff in Japan."
1343160,1348040," I mean, it was it was sick. It was cool. Right? Like compared to the other things we had at the"
1348040,1354600," time, you got to understand USB thumb drives, not a thing yet. Okay, and even though, and even when"
1354600,1359240," they were a thing, they weren't necessarily convenient, like, if you went to a library or"
1359240,1363480," something like that, it's not like it would support plugging in your USB drive. And I'm talking"
1363480,1368680," like the library at school, like you would have to, you would have to carry sometimes a floppy"
1368680,1374520," diskette with USB drivers on it. And then the USB drive that had your like your PowerPoint"
1374520,1378840," presentation or, you know, something, some kind of multimedia thing that wouldn't fit on a floppy"
1378840,1384600," disk, even once I had a USB drive, I would often still use floppy disks, not in small part because"
1384600,1388840," my first USB thumb drive was either eight megabytes or 16 megabytes. Like it actually didn't have that"
1388840,1396040," much more capacity. People thought it was weird too. Jackson, full of playing chat said mini disc"
1396040,1402280," was much more popular in Japan. I mean, yeah, I guess I guess I get it because the capacity"
1402280,1407720," compared to the things we had at the time was massive. Apparently you can copy rented music in"
1407720,1419480," Japan. And that was a big push for mini discs. Oh, interesting. Okay. I mean, Japan has all kinds"
1419480,1424600," of stuff that I just like never even saw or never heard of before. Like the kinds of stuff you can"
1424600,1429720," get in vending machines over there and stuff. Unfortunately, the one time we went to Japan,"
1429720,1435640," we didn't really get a chance to stay very short period of time. And it was awesome for that really"
1435640,1444760," short period of time, but it was awesome. Anyway, so that's hilarious. I guess it's finally time for"
1444760,1453080," floppy disks to head out right out into the sunset. I shouldn't be that surprised. I mean, I remember"
1453080,1459560," being I remember feeling this exact same emotion. Like you ever get that where it's like a deja"
1459560,1464680," vu kind of feeling, but you don't actually feel like this thing happened before, but you feel like"
1464680,1470600," you've had this you've experienced this feeling before. The day I found out that one of our major"
1470600,1476760," competitors at NCIX still submitted their POs via fax. I'm sitting here going, what you can't,"
1476760,1482760," you can't walk into the warehouse and grab a computer. You can't send a **** in email."
1482760,1488600," Like, what do you mean? Why would you submit them via fax? That one I genuinely would actually"
1488600,1495640," send your rep an email to say, Hey, check your fax machine. Yeah. That's like, leaving you"
1495640,1500600," voicemail to ask if you've checked your text messages. Like, what are you, what are you doing?"
1500600,1507240," I can't fathom it. It's very weird. It's very, very weird. It does make me a little bit sad."
1507240,1514920," And I know this probably just like makes me old, but I always really liked the physical nature of"
1514920,1521720," things. Sure. Like there's there's an Animorphs book that might be dating me as well. But there's"
1521720,1526680," an Animorphs book where they have these like data cubes. Sure. Like even Star Wars has the"
1526680,1530680," whatever they're called, the pyramid things that have knowledge of them. Yeah, for sure."
1530680,1537560," Oh, crumbs. Yeah. These like physical mediums of information. Just because I know that doesn't"
1537560,1541960," mean Star Wars isn't dead to me. Carry on. We're always, I always thought they were really cool."
1541960,1545560," I thought it was cool. I, that's one of the reasons why like physical games as well."
1545560,1552840," Sure. I've always really enjoyed physical media. And it is like better. Sure. That things are"
1552840,1561160," becoming more digital and and and whatnot. But I do find it more boring. So I think it's like kind"
1561160,1567800," of cool in a not good way. I guess maybe that some of these things still run on this old hardware"
1567800,1571560," and run on these old systems and stuff like that. I think yeah, I think it's kind of neat."
1571560,1575400," Chats super into Animorphs. Okay. Which Animorph were you?"
1575400,1581240," Which Animorph was I? Yeah. I only remember one of them. So I guess I'll just go with that."
1581240,1587160," Sure. I only remember Tobias's name. I read it. I probably read like 40/50 of them. Like I was"
1587160,1592680," super into Animorphs. Marco into bias. Tobias is like the bird. The one whose mom is the,"
1592680,1598040," I never know, I knew how to pronounce it. You're, I don't know how to pronounce. Is that the aliens?"
1598040,1603400," Yeah, this lugs. Yeah. She was control. And wasn't his like brother or is that Tobias's brother?"
1603400,1608760," I don't know. Maybe I didn't make it that far. I know Marco's mom is like Visser one or something"
1608760,1613640," like that. And I don't remember any of the other characters. And I only know Marco because you"
1613640,1618680," mentioned it. Yeah. It's been a long time. I don't remember Hawk. Yeah. I think Tobias is too"
1618680,1623480," hot. He's stuck as a hawk. And then I think he gets unstuck later. He wanted to be though, I think."
1623480,1629400," I don't remember. I remember something about him having an option to become unstuck. And he was like,"
1629400,1633240," \"Forget it I'm a hawk now.\" Yeah. Something like that. Yeah, that rings a bell. I think I did make"
1633240,1639800," it that far. People like spoilers. Spoilers. Okay. Okay. These books came out like 20 years ago."
1639800,1645240," I think, I think we're clean and clear on spoiler war teams. Yeah. Yeah. Can't remember the"
1645240,1652200," Andalight's name, man. Hold on. Hold on. Okay. Andalight's name. No, I got nothing. Because like,"
1652200,1659000," one joins them later or something. Yeah. And it's like, it's like, it's like when the, that TV show"
1659000,1663480," adds that like dumb extra character. Like, I don't remember him really serving any purpose other"
1663480,1670920," than just be like, Oh, cool. We have alien sidekick now. Thanks. That's the one nighttime. That was the"
1670920,1676040," name. And he was like the son of the one that gave them the powers in the first place or something."
1676040,1682920," I don't know. Man. Animorphs, man. I bet my daughters would love Animorphs. I don't think"
1682920,1688760," I still have a bunch of the books. I tend to keep my books, but yeah, I think I still have those."
1689240,1696520," Accimally. As a roof. Oh my goodness. What a name. Yeah. I think we'll just call you Axe. Yeah."
1696520,1701000," Yeah. That's probably a good idea. 100%. All right. What were we talking about again?"
1701000,1706600," Japan declaring war on floppy disks. Yeah. Physical media, man. Books are like physical media. Books"
1706600,1712280," are a tough one for me because on the one hand, I very unreasonable in the modern day. Yeah. They"
1712280,1718680," don't make any sense. Yeah. But the flip side of it is I've been on vacation this week. I've been"
1718680,1724600," on vacation this week and I was like, man, I haven't read a book in forever because it's tough for me."
1724600,1731800," I get sucked in. And then I don't, I'm not functional. I love to read. It's not that I don't"
1731800,1737080," love it. I just, I can. I don't have the discipline for it. It's like, it's like ano for me. It's like"
1737080,1743640," I could be sitting there for literally eight consecutive hours doing nothing but not even stopping to"
1743640,1750360," eat just like reading, right? And so I was like, oh, I'm on vacation. I'm a, I'm a read a book."
1750360,1760120," And I just, I have Kindle unlimited, but I just did not gravitate toward the Kindle at all,"
1760120,1767640," not even a tiny bit. I was like, I will go look at my library of dead trees. And I don't know why."
1767640,1772680," It doesn't make any sense. I don't want to fill my house with books. They're stupid. They're heavy."
1772680,1779960," They take up space. They're hard to find. Obviously just having one, one slate where all the words"
1779960,1786120," can just appear is it's objectively better. Yep. But it's subjectively better. And like, man,"
1786120,1793320," the book I settled on, it's called Mr. Norland Jonathan Strange. It was actually given to me by"
1793320,1798840," Tyler before he passed. Well, not given borrowed lent to me, but I wouldn't. Obviously."
1798840,1802920," Who my favorite books of all time are recommended from him. Yeah. So that was why that was why I"
1802920,1808920," wanted to read it because it was kind of the last book recommendation he gave me. And I kind of haven't"
1808920,1815240," I haven't been able to yet. But I am so I'm anyway, I'm about a quarter of the way through."
1815240,1821160," And it's like thick. It's like this thick, right? That's really inconvenient to hold. Like it sucks."
1821160,1827640," It's heavy. It's stupid. But the experience is good. Okay, we need to do a float plane pull."
1827640,1833880," Okay, physical books versus digital books. I'm on it. Honestly, I think it could be settled for me"
1833880,1839240," if digital books were way cheaper. But the fact that physical books, even with shipping, are often"
1839240,1844600," cheaper than a digital copy is just outrageous to me because I don't believe for a second that the"
1844600,1853800," author is getting way more royalties. Yeah, I do not believe that. I like I enjoy audiobooks because"
1854680,1858680," we've talked about for a long time, I have like issues, reading scripts and stuff. I'm I mildly"
1858680,1865880," dyslexic. So I read really slowly and I have a hard time reading. So I enjoy audiobooks and I"
1865880,1871960," listen to audiobooks for things that I feel like I need to get through. Like, oh, this book is on a"
1871960,1877000," topic. I feel like I should have this information for whatever reason. I want to learn something. I"
1877000,1882120," want to grow in some way, whatever. So I'll listen to an audiobook to make sure that I get all of that."
1882120,1888760," But I enjoy reading physical books. So especially if it's like some like fantasy novel or something"
1888760,1892680," like that, I'll usually read it physically. It takes me forever, but it doesn't matter. So who"
1892680,1899960," cares? See, even with a tech audience, overwhelmingly like 67%, two thirds of the book,"
1899960,1904760," chat, physical books. There's something about tactile. It feels good. And that's like, like"
1904760,1910120," putting in a floppy. When's the last time you did it? The noises. Remember the noises? It's great."
1910760,1915240," Yeah, I know. It is like I just, I don't know. It's time to play a game."
1915240,1921480," Like, let's go. You hear it spin it up. You strap the headphones on like you feel it's much more of"
1921480,1926600," like a full experience. So are you going to get into vinyl? Because that's what like everyone in the"
1926600,1930280," office, you're getting into vinyl. I'm the first person in the office that got into vinyl. They"
1930280,1937720," don't know that. But I wasn't invited to the cool kids club. What the heck? Okay, that's one that I"
1937720,1947720," can't. I can't. The second I learned about the existence of Napster, like the piles of CDs that"
1947720,1953160," I owned were okay, I shouldn't say the second I learned about Napster because it took a little"
1953160,1959000," while. Like you would have to the only way that I could listen to any to MP3s I downloaded was sitting"
1959000,1963160," at the computer, like on our computer speakers, because we didn't even have headphones and I"
1963160,1970760," had our computer. That wasn't a thing yet. So I did continue to use CDs and my discmen for a couple"
1970760,1981800," more years. But by the time you could burn a CD of MP3s, I did that a handful of times,"
1981800,1987800," but you had to have a compatible CD player. It had to be able to read data disks. And then shortly"
1987800,1994520," after that, I got an RCA Lyra, which was a 64 megabyte MP3 player, and that was it. That was the last"
1994520,2004360," time I gave two sh*ts about any kind of physical media songs. And then I did pirate music for a"
2004360,2011080," long time. And then along came music subscription services. I now happily pay for, I should not think"
2011080,2016360," I have two subscription servers. I should unsubscribe from Apple Music. But anyway, I happily pay my"
2016360,2021160," subscription. I don't pirate any music anymore. Yeah, I have YouTube music. And YouTube music is"
2021160,2025560," cool because if you buy a song on iTunes, you can just take that file and you can just upload it"
2025560,2029960," to it. Or Google Play Music had that. I don't know if YouTube music has any words. I think it still"
2029960,2035560," does. Does it still do it? Anyway, so all my songs are totally legit now, but I just..."
2035560,2041800," Man, I cannot even begin to imagine having like..."
2043080,2048920," I think they're cool. I really enjoy the look of it. I never had them when I was"
2048920,2054440," younger. Like my dad had some, but I don't think we actually had a record player set up. He actually"
2054440,2059960," has some really wicked ones, but I don't think we had a record player set up. I have some really"
2059960,2066760," cool ones. Like I have the vinyls for Divinity Original Sin 2. I have them signed by the"
2066760,2071240," development team who I met in person and all those kind of stuff. So it's really cool. The actual"
2071240,2077240," record is signed. The sleeve is signed to be clear. And I used to use them for timers,"
2077240,2080920," basically, because that was the thing that annoyed me the most is they're kind of short."
2080920,2087400," Like they end really quickly and then you have to go to the thing and flip it or change it when"
2087400,2092760," you have or whatever to be able to keep listening to stuff. That's my biggest gripe. But in order to"
2092760,2096680," solve that, yeah, I would use it as a timer. So I'll be like, oh, I'll clean this area for this"
2096680,2102280," long or I'll go out for this amount of time or I'll do whatever. Yeah."
2102280,2107480," Gremlin injector asks, why prefer those over Spotify? I subscribed to Google Play music because"
2107480,2114680," it comes with YouTube premium and YouTube premium matters a lot to me. As for why I prefer it,"
2114680,2119560," I hate YouTube music. It's terrible, but it's Google Play music was so much better. They dragged"
2119560,2125880," me kicking and screaming away from the Google Play music app because the integration with Sonos"
2125880,2131880," was flawless. It was so much better than Spotify's integration with Sonos than anything's integration"
2131880,2142280," with DTS play. It was as seamless as just pressing cast. I never, for years, I couldn't figure out"
2142280,2148520," why anybody ever even opened the Sonos app other than just adding their speakers to their system."
2148520,2152520," I didn't even need the Sonos app anymore. I would just open up the Google Play music app and I'd go"
2152520,2159720," zone, zone, zone, volume sliders, cast, one button to cast it. It's so stupid the way it works in"
2159720,2168280," the Spotify app. You have to like, you have to like create different like groups in the, or this"
2168280,2172840," is what the DTS play actually. I don't know if I've tried the Sonos one. Anyway, it's not as"
2172840,2178600," seamless. I need Google and Sonos to bury the hatchet, which I've given up ever happening,"
2178600,2183800," but I need them to bury the hatchet and just bring back the Google Play music Sonos casting"
2183800,2191160," experience because it was the best. I liked Google Play music a lot. I hate YouTube. I'm not trying"
2191160,2196280," to like bandwagon, but yeah, it's worse. YouTube music is way worse. But yeah, it's not worth"
2196280,2200520," another entire subscription to me to get Spotify and there's no way I'm not going to have YouTube"
2200520,2204840," premium because I watch a pretty considerable amount of YouTube and I don't want to watch ads."
2205800,2213160," So yeah, YouTube premium it is for me. Yeah, also the family plan for for Google"
2213160,2219560," up for YouTube music. Oh, for YouTube music, which is stupid branding. Stoop. What does music"
2219560,2225000," have to do with YouTube? Nothing. Yeah, there are music videos on YouTube. I get it, but oh,"
2225000,2230280," Conrad just said, okay, YouTube music sucks because if you shuffle a playlist, it shuffles the"
2230280,2238600," exact same way every time. It's true. I know why. Who wants that? No one wants that. I know."
2238600,2243640," I can't I can't imagine a single person is like, I'm going to enable this thing that should make"
2243640,2250440," things random. But if it changes, I'm upset. There's no way that person exists. Like, well,"
2250440,2257080," come on. I mean, no, okay. I mean, yeah, they probably do like that. But there's no way they're"
2257080,2260920," not outnumbered by everyone else who would want it to actually be random. That's fair."
2260920,2268200," Oh, it's so annoying. I have that problem literally right now. And I actually like"
2268200,2272200," tested it a bunch of times. So it's like, there's no way that's how it actually works."
2272200,2277640," So I made a really, really short playlist of I think it was like four songs or something just"
2277640,2290120," to like check. And yeah, it's the same order. Like, come on. Yeah. I just want Google Play"
2290120,2295160," music pack. That's all I want. Yeah. You know what else I want to talk about our sponsors."

2459880,2470360," check that out. Big savings. Sick. Sick. In other sponsorship news, we sponsored. Okay. Okay."
2470360,2476200," To be clear, it's not actually unheard of for us to sponsor other YouTubers. We've sponsored"
2476200,2481000," U F D tech. I know about that. Yeah. He did that like cannonball run thing. You started a few"
2481000,2485720," these sponsored that. Yeah. Yeah. We've done. I mean, it's usually when he's doing something that's"
2485720,2491160," like, you know, helping raise funds or like, yeah. Yeah. So what we like to we like to chip into"
2491160,2496440," that kind of thing. Brent's been an amazing supporter for us over the years. Yeah. So we're happy to"
2496440,2501640," happy to give something back. Of course. We've also worked with Quinn from Snazzy Labs. Yep."
2501640,2512200," But no offense to Brett or Quinn. This will be by far the biggest sponsorship that we have ever"
2512200,2519880," done. Okay. So I won't give too many details. Not going to give too many details. I will say"
2519880,2526840," that we wrote a fairly substantial check more than we've ever written for our sponsorship before."
2526840,2531720," I will say that it is for the screwdriver. So Paul, it's it."
2531720,2535400," You're gonna you're gonna make a blonde cat."
2535400,2540440," I guess I'm wrong. I tried. I shot my shot."
2540440,2545800," Okay. You can't."
2549320,2555720," Anyway, so it's for the screwed driver, which as you guys probably know, we just launched in four"
2555720,2562600," variants, all black, including a black shaft, all black with a silver shaft, black and orange"
2562600,2567080," with a black shaft and black and orange with a silver shaft. All four variants are still available."
2567080,2575640," And that is pretty much all I'm going to say about it other than that. We sponsored this person"
2575640,2584440," to build a PC with our screwdriver, obviously. And I want to let people guess."
2584440,2591320," If I told you the theme, you know who it was. Okay. Here, I can I'll tell you the theme. I'll tell"
2591320,2598840," you the theme actually. Here's what we're going to do. Let's play a little game. Okay. Luke is going"
2598840,2607960," to guess five YouTubers like verbally. Yeah. After each one that Luke guesses, I will give"
2607960,2613480," some kind of hint might be helpful. Might be not that helpful, but I will respond in some way to"
2613480,2619000," help guide Luke's guesses. Then we're going to put all five of Luke's guesses in a poll"
2619000,2623880," so that you guys can say who you think it is. And this is a tech."
2625240,2630600," Attack YouTuber. I don't know. You could you could guess someone and then maybe that would be"
2630600,2637080," something that I would tell you as a as a hint. Okay. Marquez. Marquez. Or MKBHD more specifically"
2637080,2642200," is hiring on more people. I should refer to the brand. That's actually that's a good way of"
2642200,2648840," thinking about it. Okay. Let me come up with something that I could help to help to guide you."
2649800,2656280," Some way that I could guide you. This person doesn't normally build computers."
2656280,2665000," Marquez doesn't normally build computers. Okay. Yeah, but that does that does help though. Yeah,"
2665000,2669560," exactly. Jerry Rigg everything."
2669560,2677240," Okay. I'll give you. There's been some collaboration there before. I'll give you something else. This"
2677240,2687800," person is male. Okay. Okay. So you're okay. So you're giving me something about that person that is"
2687800,2694280," accurate. So I might be able to get a country confirmation. So I'm going to say Tom Scott."
2694280,2700840," This was suggested by Flow Plan Chat, but I think it's good. Tom Scott. Yeah. Okay. This person"
2702520,2709640," has been making videos for over five years. Okay. Okay. Okay. Darn it. I wanted the country."
2709640,2720360," Good one though. I respect it. Darn. For those guessing Mark Rober? No, but we are working with"
2720360,2726440," Mark Rober. So that's going to be a fun one. That's cool. That's cool."
2729000,2735240," Interesting. It could be. I'm kind of like, I'm like already out, but there's there's some good"
2735240,2739320," suggestions. Yeah. Yeah. There's lots of different suggestions. So I think I'm going to go with"
2739320,2745960," with one of them. Where to go? Adam Savage. Adam Savage. He's been making YouTube. Okay. So"
2745960,2751720," based on his face, that was wrong. No, no, no, no. I had already I already read it in the chat."
2751720,2756280," I'm just I'm just interacting. I'm being an active listener. Yeah. What I'm really trying to"
2756280,2764040," think of is like what I can say. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This person."
2764040,2769720," I would say is pretty physically adept."
2772680,2788760," It brings me back to Marquez. No, it's not Dennis. I would never sponsor Dennis. I'm"
2788760,2792440," a mom. I need help. I will be fighting Dennis. Literally."
2792440,2797880," When is that happening, by the way? I don't know. Oh, it's not sure. I'll be ready no matter what"
2797880,2808200," though. I want to like show cast. I'm not even worried. Oh, guys, I think earlier he let it he let it"
2808200,2816120," slip that it was a tech it was someone in tech. Oh, that could be it. That's interesting."
2816120,2822920," Is he though? I don't know. I don't watch a lot of. Oh, come on Luke. Hack Smith."
2824280,2828360," All right. That's your five. Yeah. So let's go ahead. I put those in the dock. I don't know how"
2828360,2831320," a polling system works. Do you mind throwing that? Oh, you want those in a poll? Yeah. So we're going"
2831320,2837400," to let you guys we're going to let you guys guess really easy. But it's like. Okay. Do we want to do"
2837400,2843560," we want to add any more because there are some that people suggested a lot. Sure. Okay. I saw"
2843560,2849240," unbox therapy in there a lot of times. Yeah. I saw electro who's the boss."
2849240,2859880," So who's the boss? Okay. So we'll add a few more for you guys. We'll add a few more for you guys"
2859880,2866040," that actually do meet the criteria. Like obviously gamers nexus like not going to not going to be"
2866040,2872040," it like they do build computers. Yeah, sort of actually. So computers. Not really. They build test"
2872040,2880040," benches. Anyway, that's a computer. Yeah, sure. Sure. That's a computer. All right. Yeah, sure."
2880040,2887880," Let's let's go with let's go with that. No, DIY perks builds computers all the time. Come on guys."
2887880,2892600," Come on guys. That's like DIY perks is thing. You know, I heard computers."
2892600,2899400," I every single time I watch a video by him. I'm like, this is this is gotta be the end."
2899400,2905560," There's no way he thinks of something. I know more crazy than this. And then every single time"
2905560,2911080," he releases another video and I'm like, how do you do this? He released one on a lens recently"
2911080,2917320," that is just amazing. Yeah, but he made his own. Oh man, just what a wild guys wild."
2917320,2923000," I don't want a wild guy. Okay, so let's go let's go with that list. Here's what I'll say."
2923000,2932200," The correct answer. Is in the list or not in the list? Can you do that?"
2932200,2940200," Should I should I not? Let's see. Don't don't like let's have let's have some fun with you guys."
2940200,2949560," Don't don't like, you know, oh, here's actually. Oh, here's a good one. Okay. Now that I have"
2949560,2957720," this particular list, I think I'm comfortable saying actually I'm going to add this. Okay,"
2957720,2960760," there you got all those. Are we able to do a poll with that many options?"
2960760,2968280," I mean, it's currently letting me. Okay. One more. Okay. Okay. I saw the one suggested to you."
2968280,2973800," Yeah. Okay. We've got we've got, I think, the main ones that people were suggesting. Yeah."
2973800,2980680," And I think I oh wait, no, no, one more. Let's put this in there. Oh, very cool. Okay."
2980680,2988520," The correct answer is in the list. Okay. I will say I will say that. Yeah. So guys,"
2988520,2993960," the polls going up. Are you ready to post the poll? Yeah. So I want to know who you guys think"
2993960,2999560," we sponsored to do a build with the LTT screwdriver. Just wanted to make sure we have the"
2999560,3004920," spelling or something right what we did. It's posting now. Okay. Here it comes. The options are"
3004920,3013880," in no particular order. Let's go with the order that. No particular order. Jerry Rig"
3013880,3018200," Everything, Adam Savage, I Justine, Slow Mo Guys, Smarter Every Day, Henry Cavill,"
3018200,3028040," MKBHD, Tom Scott, Hacksmith, Unbox Therapy. So I'm going to let you guys vote for a little bit."
3028040,3033880," Why don't we talk through Ryzen 7000? The big news this week, obviously in the text space is"
3033880,3042440," Ryzen 7000 AMD dropped absolute knowledge bomb after knowledge bomb about their upcoming plans."
3043080,3048280," The Ryzen 9 7950X is actually getting a price drop or rather you could consider it a price"
3048280,3056520," correction compared to 5000 series. It's still 16 cores, 32 threads, but can hit a whopping 230"
3056520,3067160," watts when needed and can turbo up to 5.7 gigahertz, 5.780 mega cash on board and is rated to run with"
3067160,3075320," DDR5 5200 memory. However, AMD has already come out and said that their new expo extended profiles"
3075320,3085000," for overclocking DDR5 memory kits will be available and the sweet spot for Ryzen 7000 is going to be"
3085000,3093640," 6000 mega transfers per second. Ooh, there's some discussion questions in here from whoever"
3093640,3099240," prepared this topic for us. The 7950X being $100 cheaper than last gen could that mean that they're"
3099240,3104920," reserving the $800 slot for an X3D part? That is possible, although I wouldn't expect it to come"
3104920,3112760," anytime soon. The 7700X is $100 more than last gen, but that part came out over a year into the"
3112760,3118520," rollouts and that kind of makes sense. So it could be that the 7700X is actually the 5800X"
3118520,3124760," replacement. It's 8 core 16 threads, maximum boost to 5.4 gigahertz. I love these boost clocks."
3124760,3134120," Holy crap, are we ever getting close? I mean AMD, Ryzen, it's not a bad thing, but Ryzen"
3134120,3140200," generation after generation has been kind of an overclocking dud as far as like overclocking on"
3140200,3144600," an air cooler or an ambient water cooler. Obviously the liquid nitrogen folks are doing"
3144600,3149720," what they do with it, right? But for the mere mortals among us, it doesn't really overclock"
3149720,3156040," much, which is another way of saying that AMD has really optimized it to run at the maximum"
3156040,3163880," attainable speed for consumers out of the box. But they are getting like shockingly close to"
3163880,3167640," that 6 gigahertz barrier. That's impressive. Just like other topics we've had today is"
3167640,3174440," boring, but good. AMD claims that the 7950X, their top tier chip, is 11%"
3174840,3182920," faster overall in gaming compared to the 12900K and that even the Ryzen 5 7600X, which is $300,"
3182920,3189320," beats the 12900K in gaming, while also costing a lot less. How competitive will Ryzen 7000 be"
3189320,3197240," with Raptor Lake asks our discussion question, especially because Raptor Lake is rumored to be"
3197240,3204680," more expensive than older lake 12th gen. Wow, Canadian retailers listing 13th gen Intel core"
3204680,3209000," processors with prices 15 to 19% higher than older lake counterparts."
3209000,3216680," With that said, I know from my experience in retail that sometimes what we would do is we would"
3216680,3223000," put in placeholder prices before we actually got formal pricing that was just definitely higher"
3223000,3227560," than what it would be. So that way we could have the listings up, we could prepare our pages and"
3227560,3233640," everything. No, almost nobody would actually order at those prices because and the products"
3233640,3237880," not even out yet. It's not shipping or anything. But what it would mean is that you could get"
3237880,3243880," everything prepared and you definitely wouldn't lose money if people ordered it early. So it could"
3243880,3254680," be that this is not actually that meaningful. Either way, it could mean that the competition"
3254680,3260600," between Raptor Lake and Ryzen 7000 is going to be a little tighter than the initial rumors might"
3260600,3265640," have indicated. I'm excited. Oh no, we forgot to take the Mr. Who's the boss."
3265640,3269640," Yeah, that's my bet. Well, I guess we've ruled out. Mr. Who's the boss. Sorry."
3272200,3276920," What do you think the sweet spot is? What do you think the the the the movers going to be? Oh,"
3276920,3284200," I think it's absolutely going to be 7700X. Yeah. At 400 bucks for eight core 16 thread,"
3284200,3289880," 5.4 gigahertz boost, especially because like precision boost, whatever AMD calls it, their"
3289880,3296440," their boost technology is so good that I would actually expect this if you provide ample cooling"
3296440,3302360," to exceed that in some cases. Like I with just a tiny little bit of adjustment,"
3302360,3307720," I just don't see how you're going to get any kind of meaningful performance uplift in games"
3307720,3315160," going to 7900X or 7950X. Of course, I am totally excited to be proven wrong."
3315160,3320280," I'd love to see, you know, massively multi threaded games come and I'd love to see just like"
3320280,3327640," absolutely like run away frame rates. But I just I don't I don't foresee it happening at a time"
3327640,3331400," when the current generation consoles all have eight core CPUs. I just don't think it's realistic."
3331400,3337000," Speaking of which, the real ones. Sorry, Nintendo. Guess what I played a little bit recently and"
3337000,3342440," actually had some fun with guitar, Star Citizen. No way. Yeah, I would have actually thought"
3342440,3348600," guitar was more likely than that. Yeah. Yeah. It only had one extremely major bug that ruined"
3348600,3356760," everything. Only one. That's genuinely statistically not bad. As far as Star Citizen has gone."
3356760,3362600," Hey, what happened to the poll? Can I find expired polls? Oh, did someone like close it?"
3362600,3368600," I don't see it anymore. You we can find expired polls. There is a feature for that."
3368600,3374760," Okay. Can you do it? If I just share your screen because I want to see it's going to take me a second."
3375320,3384120," Oh, okay. Yeah, for sure. Yeah, for sure. Won't do that. All right. Cool. So we'll have a look at"
3384120,3390200," the poll results. AM five motherboards, the high end x six 70 and x six 70 E will be available at"
3390200,3399160," launch while B six 50 E and B six 50 will arrive in October. Hmm. This is a good question."
3400440,3406040," It's not going to come down to just performance. If rise in 7000 and raptor like trade blows,"
3406040,3413480," but AMD has committed to support AM five through at least 2025, which is better than Intel typically"
3413480,3421560," does, why would anyone choose Intel? It's a good question. I would really like to see"
3421560,3427160," Intel stick to their sockets for a little bit longer. To be clear, AMD's track record here,"
3427160,3437560," not perfect. I personally personally invested much money into their STR X 40 platform,"
3437560,3444280," which they said was going to get future thread ripper processors, which as of yet have not material"
3444280,3450120," at zen four is launching on AM five. And I don't even have a zen three option for my editing stations"
3450120,3458840," yet paid for many of those. So let's be clear. AMD's track record, not perfect. We got one"
3458840,3468040," generation of chips. That was it. But they are saying that they're going to go till 2025 and"
3468040,3476040," Intel typically does only two cycles. So 13th gen is going to be the end of LGA 1700 theoretically,"
3476040,3481320," which will support 12 and 13th gen, which has been a strong argument against rise in 5000 right"
3481320,3486760," now because the 12th gen platform has had some room to grow while to our to my knowledge,"
3486760,3491480," they still haven't confirmed any kind of zen four anything for socket AM four. Although I think"
3491480,3498600," they acknowledge that it could be a possibility. Am three 23. Yes, 5000 thread or pro is out now,"
3498600,3504280," it doesn't fit in an STR X 40 socket fat lot of good that does me. I didn't want thread"
3504280,3511960," or pro I wanted thread ripper for my STR X 40 socket. Right. So so in the current battle,"
3511960,3517000," 12th gen versus rise in 5000 12th gen is the smart play. All of the things being equal,"
3517000,3521640," wouldn't you rather have an upgrade path? If AM for his dead end. So the same thing's going to"
3521640,3528200," happen again, where Raptor Lake is going to be the end of LGA 1700 probably, if if Intel's pattern"
3528200,3533640," is anything to go on, while AM five could have one, two, maybe maybe three upgrades still."
3533640,3541000," Now that's not to say that you'll get the absolute most out of those future chips"
3541000,3545880," on this older platform motherboard, but that's another thing AMD has done a pretty darn good job"
3545880,3552280," of is maintaining that performance across multiple platforms. Okay, you got it? Yep."
3552280,3558600," Let's have a look at the results. I can't see them. Oh, all right."
3558600,3566040," Leading the path. It's actually surprising. No one has more than 15% and it's Henry Cavill."
3566040,3575080," Cavill Cavill. Cavill. 14%. Okay, Henry Cavill at 14%. But like Adam Savage is one percent behind"
3575080,3581560," J-Rig. Everything is one percent behind him. I'd with smarter every day. Like it's it's it's very"
3581560,3588200," close. I guess what you guys are trying to say is that there's a lot of potential collabs out there"
3588200,3593560," that you think make a lot of sense. There's there's a collab that is trying to happen right now."
3593560,3600120," Oh, that I don't I have I've tabled it to James. You don't mean project farm, right? Nope."
3600120,3603400," Okay. So someone reached out to me. I've tabled it to James."
3603400,3606440," Project Farms Review, the screwdriver, by the way, going up Sunday, apparently."
3606440,3611480," I'm stressed, but I'm excited. Okay, what's this other collab hit me? Do you want to know who it is?"
3611480,3616200," Sure. Yeah. What if you decide not to do it? Would that be weird? I don't know. There's a"
3616200,3621160," thousand reasons that a collab might not work out. So given that I'm not committed to it in any way"
3621160,3628040," at all, then I guess you can go ahead and tell me. Okay, despite this might me reaching out before"
3628040,3634200," and getting ghosted, I have now been reached out by Glarses, who is as much as I'm salty about that"
3634200,3644200," fantastic YouTuber who makes fantastic content about keyboards. And he wants to make with you,"
3644200,3651720," he wants to come out here, a socks and sandals keyboard. What the heck is a socks and sandals"
3651720,3657720," keyboard? I don't know, but the ingenuity of this man is high and I expect great things."
3657720,3662840," He's made a triple keyboard before. He's just literally just three keyboards beside each other."
3662840,3671400," He made a custom 400% keyboard, which is not actually like additional keys, which you might think."
3671400,3677960," It's just extremely extremely large. He's done many, many amazing things. And I think it could be"
3677960,3683240," really funny. All right, you know what? I'm down. But yeah, that's a potential collab."
3683240,3687640," I'm down. Yeah. Cool. All right. All right. I'm into it. I don't know what form it'll take or"
3687640,3691880," when it'll happen, but I'm interested in it. I kind of want to troll him. I mean, I still"
3691880,3696840," don't have a thing, right? A T powered computer. So clearly I'm a little behind on collabs right now."
3696840,3704280," But yes. Yeah. All right. Chad's pretty into it. I will say as much as you do need to do that"
3704280,3708200," T powered computer, I think this one's a little easier. I think he's going to fly here with the"
3708200,3712280," things that you need. And then you just like build it with him. Oh, wow. That's really easy."
3712280,3717960," Hashtag lie. I think that's what's going on. I'll have to I'll have to follow up again to figure out"
3717960,3723160," more details. But yeah. Okay. There was one last thing for Ryzen 7000, by the way,"
3723160,3730040," PCIe Gen 5 and PCIe 5.0 SSDs will come to market in October. I think that we've kind of reached"
3730040,3736680," the practical limit of PCIe SSD speeds, mattering for consumers for the next few years."
3739080,3743480," Yeah. That's good. Especially because there are other bottlenecks that are going to be concerns"
3743480,3748520," long before that kind of massive sequential throughput is going to be a problem. Still good,"
3748520,3754200," though. Oh, it's my bleep not working. You want you want that level of component to be ahead?"
3754200,3759960," That's fair. That's fair because new hardware will come and you want your your old platform to"
3759960,3764680," be ready for it. I mean, there's nothing more frustrating than going back to an old system."
3764680,3770280," You know, like, I don't know, let's say Intel 2000 and 3000 series and going,"
3770280,3775480," yeah, this is still totally fast enough for what I need to. Oh my god, it has like two USB"
3775480,3782200," three ports. Yep. 100%. Yeah. Oh, good. Gigabit ethernet is what we're going to think about"
3782200,3786760," anything older than like a couple of years ago. Yeah. Really? Gigabit? I'm trying to transfer"
3786760,3793640," a frickin file here. Yeah. Come on. For real though. For real. Yeah. Oh man. Do we want to talk"
3793640,3801000," about this until ark thing? Oh wait. Luke, do you want to guess which one you think it is?"
3801000,3804120," I'm not going to I'm not going to say it publicly. I'm going to wait for you guys to find out."
3804120,3811320," It was on the list, but do you want to guess? You can just point your mouse pointer at it and"
3811320,3820200," I'll say yes or no. Originally, it was this. Yeah. That was my first one. By the end of it,"
3820200,3825000," I was thinking this before chat voted before chat voted. Okay. It's neither."
3825000,3833080," Yeah, I won't react. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So that'll be that'll be interesting."
3833080,3839480," Yeah. That's yeah. I have I have things to say about that regarding my guess, but I will say"
3839480,3842440," nothing for now. Wait till I have to show. Yeah. Yeah. There are definitely"
3844680,3852280," things that you might say. Yeah. Okay. Intel says ark is as good or better than Nvidia at ray tracing."
3852280,3861960," Okay. So here's the thing about ray tracing is that it only really matters if your rasterization"
3861960,3870200," performance is also good. We've seen GPUs that just, you know, had ray tracing hardware on them,"
3870200,3875160," but simply weren't powerful enough for that to matter because you weren't going to be gaming at"
3875160,3882920," a reasonable level of visual fidelity anyway. So Tom Peterson told PC gamer the RTU or ray tracing"
3882920,3888120," unit that we have is particularly well suited for delivering real ray tracing performance."
3888120,3893560," And you'll see that when you do ray tracing on comparisons with an RTX 3060 versus an a 750 or"
3893560,3899960," a 7700, we should fare very, very well. The Intel graphics YouTube channel released a ray tracing"
3899960,3905880," technology deep dive yesterday where they showed some actual software, everything from benchmarks"
3905880,3912520," to real games running on their arc hardware. So let's go ahead and skip to some of the time stamps"
3912520,3919160," that matter actually. Luke, do you want to give me some time stamps here? At 18 seconds. There's"
3919160,3923480," Ghostwire Tokyo running on an a 770 with ray tracing. Here we go."
3923480,3930840," Wow. Thank you, YouTube compression. This looks like absolute horse. So that's cool."
3930840,3937720," One of the problems is any visual stuff on YouTube. Yeah. What am I even running at here? Oh,"
3937720,3943240," cool. Auto 360 P because because I'm not on a 10 gigabit internet connection."
3945960,3950360," I had a Twitch clip. I don't really watch Twitch, but it was a clip. I had a Twitch clip that"
3950360,3953560," shared to me the other day and I was like, wow, this looks horrible. I figured out it had auto"
3953560,3960760," to 144. And I was like, that's, I'm amazed. Tell me you don't care about VOD and the VOD"
3960760,3966760," experience without telling me you don't care about the VOD experience. Yeah. At 1046, this"
3966760,3974680," shows 3D Mark Direct X ray tracing featured test on the a 770 versus a 3060 at 1445. It shows an"
3974680,3977640," Intel spheres demo. There's, there's some, there's some cool stuff."
3977640,3982840," Yeah. So you can check that out. But here's our discussion question. And this is sort of a big one."
3982840,3990920," If this card were released today, okay, amidst the, the pricing pocalypse in the GPU market, right?"
3990920,3997560," So let's, let's head over to new egg. If these cards were released today with all the, the, the"
3997560,4002520," warts that they have, like, I mean, even aside from the issues that Intel has acknowledged with"
4002520,4009240," things like Direct X nine performance, right? We've encountered other problems, like emulators,"
4009240,4014200," just these are small community projects. They don't have giant teams of developers. They don't"
4014200,4019960," have billion dollar companies behind them. Right. My experience running emulators on Intel"
4019960,4025880," graphics hardware has been has been awful and emulation is a huge part of YPC gaming."
4025880,4031800," You know, why a device like the steam deck is so great because you can play literally every game"
4031800,4037400," ever, not literally, but you guys understand what I mean, right? So knowing that there are going to be"
4037400,4048440," caveats in a world where an RTX 3060 is slashed all the way down to 380 bucks brand new. Okay,"
4048440,4052120," that was the lowest one that I saw. We're going to head over to eBay. Okay, these are,"
4052120,4057960," remember, these are current gen cards. We're not even talking last gen cards that can achieve"
4057960,4065080," equivalent-ish performance. So let's have a look at our sold. No, not condition. Come on,"
4065080,4072040," come on, sold items. Yeah, here we go. Where are people paying like new pricing for? Oh, that's a"
4072040,4085480," TI. Okay. Here's a 3060 for $308. Here's a 3060 for $250, 300 bucks, 300 bucks, 290. So these are"
4085480,4095000," going for as little as 250 to just just around $300 at this point. What price would Intel need to"
4095000,4104440," come in at for you to consider an arc alchemist GPU? What would it take? Like unless it's okay,"
4104440,4110280," no, I'm gonna let you go first. Actually, oh, we should pull again. Let's let's let's pull. So I"
4110280,4117960," want to see like 200 to 250, 250 to 300, 300 to 350. Because I don't think anything above that"
4117960,4122520," is reasonable. I mean, you can put in 350 to 400, I guess you might as well just have it there, right?"
4122520,4130200," Okay, then we're gonna on the pool. Okay, Luke's working on the pool. Well, maybe I should,"
4130200,4134520," I push out, okay, do I, am I just an idiot and I can't find the pool tool? Like, I don't see how"
4134520,4143160," to do it. I think so. Okay, where's the button? It's really straight. Oh, it's not in the chat window,"
4143160,4150920," that's why you can't find it. Ah, yeah. It's just to the just barely to the bottom right of the player."
4150920,4155720," Well, there it is. Look at that. And you just make a pool like that. And now that you know that,"
4155720,4162360," when the player when the new player launches, yeah, it's probably gonna move. Cool. So, and the new"
4162360,4165960," player is launching like, immediately. Pretty darn soon. Okay, perfect. Thanks, Luke. That's"
4165960,4171080," really helpful. Yeah, no worries. Okay, I want to hear what I want to hear what you say."
4171080,4180120," What's what's your reason? Yeah, what's the what's the arc arc alchemist price range for the,"
4180120,4184680," because remember, this is so we're talking a 770. Okay, a 770. That's the that's the one that"
4184680,4191080," they're positioning against the 3060. What's the price range that would get you to buy? Yeah."
4191960,4198040," Yeah. What's the maximum price range that you would buy up? I think you're overthinking it."
4198040,4204440," There was too many characters in the title I'd read. I see. What's your price?"
4204440,4212440," Choose your price to me. I for me, it's like"
4212440,4219720," it's tough because at different times, I would have said different things because"
4220280,4227240," right now I use my computer for work a lot. So there isn't one. Sure. You know what I mean?"
4227240,4233400," I'm not willing. I need something very stable. Got it. Okay. Because if I if I can't get my"
4233400,4237240," computer working, no, I'm going to flip this around on you. I'm not going to let I'm not going"
4237240,4242520," to let you hide behind the it's for work. So I'm not done. Okay. All right. Okay. All right."
4242520,4247240," Other times I was going to cop out. I was I looked like a cop. I can understand. It looked and it"
4247240,4252760," smelled like a cop out for sure. I would also say though, at other times in my life, I really like"
4252760,4258120," this type of stuff. Oh, so you would just get the newcomer just to like very likely try. I would"
4258120,4261960," want to see what's going on. I would want to try the different emulators, see which ones broke,"
4261960,4266360," figure out why see what those emulators were doing about it, figure out what the problems were,"
4266360,4271800," try different games. That would be very exciting and enticing for me. So I'd probably say the 300"
4271800,4279400," to 350 range because I wouldn't want it to be more expensive. Sure. But I would be willing to take"
4279400,4284120," the risk if that makes sense. All right. Here is I'm going to throw one more scenario at you though."
4284120,4289400," What if it was today and you were you now? Okay. But it wasn't for work. This is purely for our"
4289400,4295480," gaming rig because and before you answer, I want you to consider the challenge that we had"
4297080,4301880," that we undertook recently where we switched to daily driving Linux. I wanted to do this with"
4301880,4308520," these cards. So the social I think I mentioned that the social aspect of gaming is like a huge"
4308520,4313640," part of it. And that was a big part of what I felt like you and I both missed out on during"
4313640,4319320," the Linux challenge is that even though it run was a we were able to get a lot of games running"
4319320,4324920," sometimes with a fair bit of work. If you can't play what everyone else is playing,"
4324920,4331080," it doesn't matter how well it performs. It just doesn't matter because you are not able to have"
4331080,4337080," that social experience. And I'd read that if it's cheaper than $600. I'm not buying it. I don't"
4337080,4341960," buy anything that's not expensive because it makes me feel because it makes me. Oh, shut up,"
4341960,4345160," Conrad. You're just trolling. You're trolling."
4345160,4354520," He's easy. I don't know if that's serious or not."
4354520,4359320," Well, at any rate, he's kind of a baller."
4359320,4364040," Here's the here's the poll results. Sorry. Here's the poll results."
4364040,4371480," Okay, I think he's the winning. The winning result is 200 to 250 bucks over on Flowplane."
4371480,4373160," Yeah, because everyone wants it to be as cheap as possible."
4373160,4381560," 46% of the vote. Although a massive 36% of you are saying 250 to 300 is also fine"
4381560,4389320," with 13% of you saying 300 to 350. So actually, you're in the 13% Luke who are saying like,"
4389320,4392360," yeah, it just needs to be competitive. It doesn't actually need to be cheap."
4392360,4396520," I find it very interesting. I think it would also change depending on what card I currently have."
4397160,4404120," If I had a card that was, it could still do it with modern games, then I just wouldn't get"
4404120,4407640," rid of my current card right away. Right, because then you could always bail."
4407640,4415000," Yeah. But if I had a card that was like, it died or something, I might be less willing."
4415000,4419080," Yeah, like you, it would depend on my life stage because there were definitely times in my life"
4419080,4425240," that I didn't have enough capital to have a spare GPU. I would immediately be flipping that."
4425240,4430360," You'd have to be able to afford the next one 100%. Yeah. So it like, it depends on a lot of things,"
4430360,4435560," but there's definitely price ranges and scenarios here where I'm down 100%. I'm very intrigued by"
4435560,4441960," these GPUs. I think I even mentioned like us doing a challenge where we have to run it when it was"
4441960,4444440," announced or something like that was a long time ago. I don't remember if I did or not."
4444440,4452520," But I, it's very interesting to me. I've always really wanted Intel to succeed with this because"
4452520,4459400," I want another player in the space. Luke can confirm that I didn't change the formatting of the person"
4459400,4464440," that I pointed to who was the person that was sponsored. All I did was move the cursor next to"
4464440,4469320," it. The formatting is different for different people because just the document is, and I just"
4469320,4472680," didn't bother to. I mean, it's just different for the top one because it was the first one that was"
4472680,4476840," typed in. So it still had the like header. Yeah. Yeah. So don't read too much into it guys."
4479640,4488040," All right. Let's go ahead and where's our food at? And he didn't point at it by like changing the"
4488040,4492200," font that's extremely unnecessary. If you ever use Google Docs before, he just put his cursor there."
4492200,4500120," For the food, I think he went, he went home for a bit. I looked on the map. He was, he's almost here."
4500120,4504360," Okay. After I messaged him saying, hello, are you coming? I saw his car turn around and start"
4504360,4510120," going back towards us. So, you know, it might be cold man with the lads, but we'll find out."
4510120,4517160," I mean, cold chicken and warm, cold. I was going to say, how long has it been?"
4517160,4521560," Because like cooked chicken. It's been long enough that Uber each is like, we're so sorry."
4521560,4526440," So yeah, right. But like, is it like, okay, because it's cooked chicken? Yeah, it's not been"
4526440,4531080," that long. Okay. It's only like two hours. Do I get like a partial like refund or like,"
4531080,4537320," how does this work? I do believe so. It's been a very, very long time. Okay, cool."
4537320,4544200," For those of you who haven't got any merch messages in yet, we are going to be responding to the"
4544200,4549640," curated ones from Bell in a little bit. We're just, we're waiting for our food. So we wanted to get"
4549640,4552680," through all our topics. I just thought the food was going to be here a little sooner. We're getting"
4552680,4557960," some chicken. Cool. And those with the lads. I like it a lot. Hey, you know what's cool? I get"
4557960,4567240," to cover a controversy that's not my own for a change. Yeah. Yeah. We did it. Debrand is facing"
4567240,4574360," backlash after posting a production update for their steam deck accessory kit project kill switch."
4574360,4579480," The notes are prepared by Riley. So if there's anything wrong in here, then I blame Riley."
4579480,4585160," On Thursday, Debrand posted an update source to original update from Debrand. Here we go. And"
4585160,4593000," this is in our slash steam deck. It'll load eventually. I promise we actually do have fast"
4593000,4598920," internet here because we care about people's productivity and mental well-being. Man, loading"
4598920,4605560," just bothers me so much more now than it used to. The social team posted an amazing meme that was like,"
4605560,4610360," ah, my game is taking an hour to download. And then like the like,"
4611320,4617080," ah, yes, I will listen to this MP3 after a night of restful slumber. Like I just my mentality"
4617080,4621000," was good has totally changed about it. I thought that was a little bit. It still doesn't bug me"
4621000,4626600," that much. I like having fast internet, but like I'm not I'm not willing to to fork out the funds"
4626600,4631880," for gigabit right now. So they posted this update talking about the release date, talking about"
4631880,4637960," some different stoves, how the reservation was going to work, some different scenarios,"
4637960,4643640," and kind of some stuff like that price elasticity of demand percentage of customers willing to pay"
4643640,4647240," at I don't even know what any of that is. So cool. Anyway, they posted an update."
4647240,4657480," They said that they would launch September 28th in the form of an essential kit at 59.95"
4657480,4664120," and a travel kit at 74.95. Well, the the the update number four says to some or September 25th."
4665080,4671400," Well, sure. Users immediately noticed the absence of any mention of the tempered glass screen protector,"
4671400,4676200," which many thought would be bundled with every other component in one kit, since it was listed"
4676200,4680760," along with the other components on dbrand's website source three, which I won't bother clicking right"
4680760,4685720," now. This led to anger that dbrand was ripping people off by removing an item from the bundle"
4685720,4690840," after promising it would be included. Some users criticized dbrand for charging extra for basic"
4690840,4696360," components in an official response posted under an hour ago, dbrand explains that they initially"
4696360,4700200," announced Project Killswitch is an umbrella term to encompass their suite of steam deck accessories"
4700200,4706200," and fairness. I did not know that I thought it was just the case. So I apparently was not even"
4706200,4710600," among their audience, one of the two camps in terms of how they interpreted that camp,"
4710600,4715800," a assumed all six items would be included as a single product purchased at one MSRP. So case"
4715800,4720760," kickstand travel cover skin for the case screen protector and stick grips while camp be assumed"
4720760,4725480," to want to see it. All six items were standalone products. Here's the source. Okay, got it."
4725480,4730840," Complicating things is the fact that the screen protector launched six months ago and was purchased"
4730840,4736360," by dbrand says the majority of kill switch reservation holders who paid a $3 reservation fee,"
4736360,4740440," which was subtracted from the price of purchase. The way dbrand sees it, including everything in"
4740440,4745560," one bundle, what camp a wants would saddle 68% of reservation holders with a duplicate product."
4745560,4748920," So they split it into two kits and keep the screen protector as a standalone purchase."
4748920,4753320," However, there's also the fact that prior to update number four, dbrand reservation holders"
4753320,4757240," received an email with a survey asking what price they'd be willing to pay for a kit."
4757240,4760360," dbrand included this data at the bottom of the Reddit post. Okay, that's what we were looking at."
4760360,4764520," So users are accusing dbrand of making this decision after finding out that they could make"
4764520,4771720," more money by splitting the products up in this way. Huh, okay. Um,"
4772600,4783080," is there like a preorder, an image of the preorder page? Well, it wasn't really a preorder."
4783080,4788520," So people couldn't purchase it. They hadn't announced pricing. So no one put their money down."
4788520,4795480," Um, yeah. I mean, I think so. Does it matter?"
4798200,4805320," I don't know. I don't really get it. The, okay. So the original picture, the, uh, the, um,"
4805320,4814520," let's see, not the update number four, not that, but the picture screenshot of kill switch listing"
4814520,4820840," tempered glass as a component. This I could definitely see being interpreted in, in different ways."
4820840,4828120," Because this is pro can I zoom in? Yeah. So there's a project components thing at the bottom."
4828440,4832760," I'll make this really big and then share my screen so that people can see what I'm talking about."
4832760,4837480," So this is at the bottom project components impact resistant grip case, magnetic kickstand,"
4837480,4844760," skins, tempered glass, travel cover, stick grips. Um, but it doesn't like, it doesn't like say"
4844760,4852680," that like, I don't know, it could be a line of products. It could be one package of products."
4852680,4855320," It doesn't say any of that. I don't know."
4857240,4863080," Yeah. I also, there's no pricing. So what does it even matter if it's included or not?"
4863080,4868520," If they made the tempered glass thing, you can just buy it, right? You can buy it now. Yeah. So I"
4868520,4871720," don't get it. If they never announced the pricing, what does it actually change?"
4871720,4879960," So just add one of the bundles to your cart and then also add the tempered glass to your cart."
4882920,4889320," Okay. People, including I put $3 down for Project Kill Switch. What does that even mean?"
4889320,4895560," Well, that's, that's to like reserve, like basically it's to indicate interest in a way that D-brand"
4895560,4901560," can actually kind of count on. Like I wish that when we had taken screwdriver or backpack interest"
4901560,4907880," levels that we had taken like a sum token amount of money because it's a much, it's a much larger"
4907880,4912840," commitment. Do you make that refundable? So the way it works is when you place your order, it's"
4912840,4917400," included or something like that. And it's a fairly negligible amount, like it's three bucks. So I"
4917400,4923160," think for them, they saw that as justifiable. Now that we've done things, the way that we've done"
4923160,4926680," them, I don't know that we'll change it just because it's kind of working for us and everyone"
4926680,4930360," has their own way of doing things. But it's definitely something that I'd want to reevaluate"
4930360,4936200," next time we have like a sign up for notification. You know, do we want to take some kind of deposit?"
4936200,4939640," Do we not want to take a deposit? We had a lot of people say we should have taken a deposit kind"
4939640,4947000," of like Valves done with the Steam Jack. Yeah, so I don't know. We'll think about it. I don't know."
4947000,4954520," For me, the most interesting part of all of this is the way that D-brand can pivot between being"
4954520,4964200," antagonistic towards their customers and the absolute royal crown, crown, king and queen of"
4964200,4970440," trolling the entire world and being like meticulous and professional in their communication."
4970440,4978680," But all without not being them, this is probably the funniest line in this whole response."
4978680,4985400," Replying to this Reddit post, can you attach the travel cover when the deck doesn't have"
4985400,4990360," the kill switch case on? Does the deck fit in the Valves supplied case with the travel cover on?"
4990920,4996280," By their understanding, the travel cover is a truly standalone component usable without a case."
4996280,5001960," At least 12 other users seem to agree with their understanding. At no point did we suggest this was"
5001960,5008040," a possibility. This user is simply mistaken. While it is fair to hold us to a higher standard of"
5008040,5013480," customer consumer education on interoperability, the reality is that we have almost 11 years of"
5013480,5018120," data to support the notion that this type of misunderstanding is unavoidable at scale."
5018120,5026520," They just basically called people idiots. But in the most professional way that I think I have ever"
5026520,5034840," seen. I think there's no reason to me why I don't know."
5034840,5041720," Yeah, I don't know. Does it even say it's a magnetic kickstand? I don't know. I'm over it."
5041720,5042280," I'm over it."
5044600,5048680," If you can't refund, it's a pre-order. Don't go back in your word. Yeah, that makes sense to me."
5048680,5057000," All right. Yeah, I mean, I guess if people didn't know what they were buying, then Dbrand's"
5057000,5063480," biggest sin here is just not figuring out the plan. It is very unclear. I will say that much."
5063480,5070280," When you go to the project page, it says project could like, we're doing this project, we're looking"
5070280,5076120," for interest, whatever, reserve yours for $3. The project includes all of these things."
5076120,5082360," My base assumption would be that I'm buying this thing that costs this much."
5082360,5087240," Not that costs as much. I actually have no idea how much it costs, so there's no way in"
5087240,5092280," how I would ever do this. Because why would I reserve something that I have no idea what the"
5092280,5098680," price for it is? But I mean, that's other people's thing. You can do whatever you want."
5098680,5103720," But I would assume that it's one package that has all of this. But again, if it's all possible"
5103720,5112360," for sale and they didn't say them how much it costs, then who cares? I don't know. I don't really"
5112360,5119800," get it. I don't think this matters. But I also just learned about it now and don't really understand"
5119800,5125320," everything that's going on. So sounds good. Trostaf asks, \"I wish floatplane took up more of the"
5125320,5128920," screen when not full screen. Thankfully, picture in pictures there. The new player. Is it going to"
5128920,5133000," have like a theater mode style thing?\" \"The theater mode.\" Cool. Coming very soon. Coming soon."
5133000,5143000," \"The mythical new player.\" All right. The chickens here. We've got some chicken. That means I think"
5143000,5148600," it's time to do some merch messages and go off the rails a little bit here. So here, we're trying"
5148600,5154040," something new this week. We've had some people saying they don't like merch messages, like clogging up"
5154040,5159400," the tech discussion. So we're doing all the tech discussion front loaded. So if you don't like"
5159400,5166760," the Q&A stuff and all that goodness, then see you later. And we're hungry. So we're going to have"
5166760,5174840," some dinner. Hey, thanks, Bell. Thank you. You didn't, by any chance, happen to get your hands on like"
5174840,5182840," thingamahiki for putting in the thing. Did you? A thingamahiki. What a guy. He's got the forks."
5182840,5189000," He's got that sauce. What's the sauce for? You don't like shake it. You just mix it with the fork?"
5189000,5194040," Well, I don't know. I told you, I've never had nandos before. I don't know what the sauce is for."
5194040,5202120," That is some lukewarm chicken. Oh boy. That is lukewarm a. We both get one of these. I thought"
5202120,5205800," we got different things. I don't know. No, we both ordered the same thing. That's why I was telling"
5205800,5212760," you. No, but like the, what do you call it? The base? The base? Oh, the the the yeah, the basting."
5212760,5216680," Okay, so that's just for the chicken. I got medium. This is whatever goes on the salad."
5216680,5221480," Yeah, I don't on the salad. I think there's a whatever. I don't know what this is. I don't even"
5221480,5227400," know what's happening. I don't even know what's happening. Wait, did did this order literally take"
5227400,5234760," an hour and a half to arrive and didn't come with forks? Wow. This is this is amazing. All right,"
5234760,5240040," Bon Appetit, everyone. Do you have to like say that you need forks? Bell, while you get settled in,"
5240040,5245000," I'm just going to get a couple of merch messages going here. Okay. Oh man, there's a lot of curated"
5245000,5249800," ones tonight. All right, cool. Kayla Bask, what's the longest road trip you've ever taken currently"
5249800,5255320," on a 10 hour drive? Thanks for the infotainment. I don't actually know which one is technically"
5255320,5261400," longer. That's what she said. But I've, but I road tripped to Winnipeg and I road tripped to"
5261400,5265720," Arizona. I feel like Arizona is longer. That's quite a bit further. Pretty sure. I've never mapped it."
5265720,5271080," Oh crap. And Canada's big. Oh crap. I just threw rice all over myself. This is not good."
5271080,5276280," Is it your, you mix it like that? That's what I've done before. Well, I don't, I don't, like,"
5276280,5280840," no, I don't have, I haven't had this container. There's rice everywhere. Because if I get a bowl,"
5280840,5287320," I usually like shake it up. Thanks for nothing, Luke. I'm sorry. The longest road trip I've ever been"
5287320,5291240," on. Should I try it now? I always don't want to if it just sprayed everywhere. It was to Halifax."
5291240,5295400," I was going to do it before. So I drove across the country. Oh, that's long. When I, when I learned"
5295400,5303960," to drive. So the day I got my learner's permit, right? So I was 16 years old, exactly. The day I got"
5303960,5311240," my learner's permit, I took my knowledge test. That's it. It's purely a knowledge test. And I walked"
5311240,5317880," out to the parking lot, all excited. And my mom was like, what the **** are you doing? That's"
5317880,5328680," the passenger seat you drive now. And I was like, uh, K, this is a manual car. I, you had no training"
5328680,5337560," on manual yet? No. So she's like, well, no time like the present. So I drove out of like the,"
5337560,5342760," I wouldn't call it a city, like a maple ridge, like it's not, but I drove out of the ICBC"
5342760,5353160," licensing office in Maple Ridge home. Um, stick, which was interesting. Then we packed and we left"
5353160,5358600," because my birthday is in the late summer and we needed to be back for school to start. So this was"
5358600,5365240," on a trip. We were back for school and we left on either my birthday or the day after or something"
5365240,5371480," like that. Um, that was a long way. There's a lot of being in a car with two people. Yeah. Um,"
5371480,5376680," it was, it was good though. It was very memorable. It was one of the most memorable things I've done"
5376680,5387240," in my life. Definitely worth it. Cool. Next question here is from, uh, NCC 1702,"
5387240,5392600," Linus, your existential dread about LMG, your legacy has inspired me to change how I train people."
5393480,5399240," That is irrelevant, but would you, would you ever have LTT themed framework accessories,"
5399240,5403000," whether it's the shell or other parts of ore components?"
5403000,5409400," The training thing is kind of ominous. I wonder if that's a good thing or not."
5409400,5413800," Well, I think it is a good thing. I think that, that we should always try to,"
5413800,5420840," it depends what the goal is, right? So if my goal is to build something that provides"
5420840,5427560," information to consumers long after I'm dead, then I should be preparing for me to be dead as soon as"
5427560,5435000," possible. Right? But if my goal is to run a company, well, then obviously I don't really give two"
5435000,5439480," hoots about what happens to it when I'm dead because my goal is just to run a company, right? So,"
5439480,5443720," yeah, it's, I don't know, there's a lot of people here that are younger than me. They will, they will"
5443720,5449720," outlive me. Um, you know, I don't know that the younger people than me, like the Jake Bell events"
5449720,5453480," is of the world, the Lucla friend years of the world. I don't know that they'll still be here."
5453480,5455560," I don't think I'm going to outlive you for that long. That's fair."
5455560,5462920," That's an inside joke. It is. Yeah. Anyway, not explaining that. The point is I do think it"
5462920,5470680," matters. So my, for my goal matters a lot. As for your question, reframe work, LTT branded framework"
5470680,5477320," accessories, any business decision has to be like, it starts with a Venn diagram. Like it's so,"
5477320,5483320," it's so simple. We learn it in grade two, grade three, or whatever it is, but it's such an important"
5483320,5490440," life skill. Anytime I do anything, I basically start drawing a circle. Um, and I try to find,"
5490440,5497080," you know, what the, what the, what the necessary circles are that will land on the person who is"
5497080,5502120," interested in that, in that service or that product or that piece of content. And I talk,"
5502120,5508120," honestly, even not this week, because I was on vacation, but last week, I probably had a Venn"
5508120,5513160," diagram conversation with two separate writers, whether it's pitching a video concept or whether"
5513160,5517720," it's, um, you know, during the script, a paragraph that they've written where I've gone, okay,"
5517720,5525560," this paragraph is relevant to people who are super into Linux, people who get this joke you've"
5525560,5535080," made and people who, um, you know, have been keeping up with the current events that, uh, this, this,"
5535080,5540040," like news thing that you alluded to. So you've got these circles and you've got this tiny little"
5540040,5545000," intersection. You've got small circles with the tiny intersection and basically it doesn't land"
5545000,5549800," unless all of these stars align. You wrote this joke for yourself, take it out, you know, like"
5549800,5553880," those kinds of conversations, they're tough conversations, but it's a really important training exercise"
5553880,5560360," so that you don't just spin your wheels producing products or creating content that nobody actually"
5560360,5566760," wants to consume, right? Um, and so I feel like the LTT themed framework accessories"
5566760,5572040," fall there. No offense to framework, love framework, love their mission invested in the company,"
5572040,5578840," right? But their market share in the laptop space is, it's not a circle, it's a dot, you know?"
5578840,5589720," And so we need that dot to out to overlap with LTT, uh, viewers, right? We need that, we need the"
5589720,5597640," subset of LTT viewers that will actually buy anything LTT branded that want to rep the brand."
5597640,5601400," They have to actually have bought a framework laptop, right? So you got people interested in"
5601400,5606840," framework, people interested in LTT, people who actually bought a framework and people who are"
5606840,5610760," willing to buy something from LTT, you're asking for so many stars to align. I just don't think"
5610760,5614280," it's feasible. There's minimum order quantities, right? Like if it was some 3D printed thing that"
5614280,5619240," we could throw up on Thingiverse or something or I think Thingiverse ran afoul of like the creator"
5619240,5623000," community or something. I don't know. Don't quote me on that. But whatever the trendy,"
5623000,5629240," whatever the trendy place to throw up 3D printing files, right? Um, sure, sure. Yeah, that's fine."
5629240,5633320," But if we're talking mass mass production product where you have to make a thousand or"
5633320,5639880," 5,000, 10,000 of them, I just don't think it's feasible. There's also, I think, I think within the"
5639880,5645640," kind of whole idea of framework and things that we have promoted in the past, um, try to go to like"
5645640,5655480," a hobby space and laser cut your own vinyl. Yeah, sweet. I did it. My laptop has a purple"
5655480,5661560," D brand skin on it. And then someone, I was talking about wanting to do it. And then someone sent"
5661560,5666680," them to me better than I would have made, which was fantastic. And it's a, it's a hunter. There's"
5666680,5671640," eyes in the mouth and it goes on the purple. It looks like hunter and it's amazing. Looks super"
5671640,5679400," cool. Still there, still holding up really well. Yeah, it's great. Question for both of you."
5679400,5683000," This is good, but it's a really wimpy amount of chicken. Yeah, you were talking about how"
5683000,5687080," there's going to be way too much chicken, but those are all fake photos. Yeah, like this is like"
5687080,5690680," nothing. There's like no chicken. It's actually very little chicken. Yeah, if anything, I'm"
5690680,5695400," disappointed in the amount of chicken. I need more dead bird. Nando's reach out. We want the"
5695400,5701480," sponsorship. Change our minds. Yeah, we'll make a whole segment or something. Question from Jay"
5701480,5709800," for the both of you. Do you have any games on your phone? Yes. Why? Orna. I've talked about it on the"
5709800,5716280," show before. It's a, um, I don't know what to call the category map game, GPS game,"
5716840,5722360," whatever, but it's like a Pokemon. Yeah. Go. What I really like about it. Pokemon go alike. Yeah, sure."
5722360,5727800," What I really like about it is I think you know the story of Pokemon, my thing with Pokemon go."
5727800,5732200," It launched. I didn't look into it. I went on a hike because I wanted to get a geo dude. For sure."
5732200,5738280," And there's no Pokemon on the mountain because they want you to funnel into these polka stops."
5738280,5743560," Orna's not like that at all. Orna will actually detect like, hey, there's a forest here. We're"
5743560,5748760," gonna make it a forest biome. There will be more forest things. Same thing for water, stuff like that."
5748760,5754840," So it has significantly more stuff built into it that encourages you to get out there and move"
5754840,5759240," around and right and go on hikes and go off road and do those types of things, which I think is"
5759240,5764440," very cool. So I've been enjoying it. It is a mobile game. There are some pay to make your"
5764440,5770200," gameplay more successful. I wouldn't necessarily say win. Is there a win? You'll get more. Yeah,"
5770200,5775320," exactly. That's the problem. You get more loot and stuff though. So you could perform better with"
5775320,5780120," the amount of gameplay time that you invest, which I kind of do see as a form of pay to win."
5780120,5789080," But yeah, orna's sweet. I enjoy it. It encourages me to go outside. I have some games. I get quests"
5789080,5795480," all the time like go walk 2000 meters and I'm like, cool. I have checkers free chess."
5796680,5800760," Oh, I also have chess. Nice little time killer with the kids. I have dress coloring."
5800760,5805080," Sometimes the girls like to sit and play with my phone. Sure."
5805080,5810440," I have Minecraft on here apparently. I've never opened it. I don't know why that's on here."
5810440,5817800," Yeah, I have leechs and chess.com. I don't know why I didn't think of those I use as well."
5817800,5824920," X to twist to. That's just like a comfort food game. Yvonne and I like to play together."
5824920,5830040," I have Retroarch on here unicorn color book glitter. That's also for the girls."
5830040,5835640," And that's it. That's it for the games on my phone. I'm not really a big mobile gamer anymore."
5835640,5838920," I used to play more mobile games back when they were just actually like simpler."
5838920,5845160," In a way, they've kind of gotten too complicated for me. Like I'm not going to sit down with the"
5845160,5851480," intention of playing a game for an hour on my phone. Like, but it was like happy jump."
5852200,5856200," Like, yeah, I'm on the train. Yeah, it's like a happy bird. That era of games was like,"
5856200,5863560," that's all I wanted for sure. Yeah, agreed. Here's some Bell Lord to give him some more time to eat."
5863560,5868360," I love mobile games. I play a lot, but I prefer the ones that you can just buy and be done."
5868360,5871560," 100%. So without explaining, here's a bunch of onesies to check out."
5871560,5877560," Hold down down well, slay the spire. Wait, so this spire is on your phone now?"
5877560,5881640," Oh, I play it so much on the phone. It's perfect for the phone because you can just like,"
5882520,5886120," click it and it saves your spot and you can move on with your life and go back and keep playing."
5886120,5891960," So I have many hours in that. Loop hero also on the phone also plays great on the phone,"
5891960,5896200," a dark room. The one I'm going to explain so they have more time,"
5896200,5901240," play down well. It's just go down the hole and try not to die. It'll cost you like five bucks,"
5901240,5908600," but it's great. Cool. Next question here from here."
5910600,5918360," Yeah, it was fine. Yeah, it's been it's been great. It's perfect."
5918360,5926360," Next one here. You guys tweeted out a while ago. This question's from Brandon, by the way,"
5926360,5931160," that you're looking for the next big thing. I shouldn't be. Oh, Chad saying you were."
5931160,5936520," That's probably old classic. Classic. Chad always such pranksters. We tweeted out,"
5936520,5940040," what should we make next? And other way of the backpack and screwdriver out. Was there anything"
5940040,5943240," that you read that you were like, actually, this is a good idea or something we should consider?"
5943240,5948200," There's definitely some good ideas that I saw. I saw someone posted that we should do a glow in"
5948200,5953960," the dark screwdriver. I messaged that to Nick, who said apparently it was already on the list."
5953960,5957960," And then Yvonne said that she had suggested at some point. So apparently it was already like,"
5957960,5965320," on the random future ideas list, I'd say some of the most obvious ones are a smaller version"
5965320,5972360," of the backpack. Got a lot of people asking for that. Yeah, RGB screwdriver. That I don't think we"
5972360,5977960," have planned anytime soon. Smaller version of the backpack though, maybe costed down as well."
5977960,5983880," Yeah, I think people might end up disappointed at how little it ends up affecting the cost because"
5983880,5989000," most of the cost is in the construction, not the raw materials. And the construction is really"
5989000,5994120," complicated. It's a really complex bag to manufacture. That's a big part of why it costs so much."
5994920,6000760," I saw a really interesting post breaking down how much we've made on backpack and screwdriver on"
6000760,6007640," Reddit. No way that's accurate. It was not accurate. Our costs, so I just want to make it really clear."
6007640,6017640," It expected or it estimated our costs at 25% of our retail price. That is not even close on either"
6017640,6023640," backpack or screwdriver. Our costs are substantially higher than that on both of them because materials,"
6023640,6030600," construction, logistics, they all cost a lot of money more than you obviously, more than you think."
6030600,6037800," They're profitable. We're making money. It's good. It's good business. But it's not, yeah,"
6037800,6042840," we're not making, what would that work out to? 400 points on them? That's not happening."
6042840,6051240," Other stuff. I mean, yeah, we'd love to do more variants of the screwdriver."
6051240,6054760," There's an email from you that I need to respond to. I've been mulling it over."
6054760,6061000," I think super no, like aggressively no. Oh, wait, what did I say? Is this not? It was about"
6061000,6069560," buying up a certain company. Buying a company. That is making a thing that I theoretically"
6069560,6076680," wanted at one point. Oh, can we just talk about it? Oh, we should not buy it. I pitched to Luke. I"
6076680,6083560," was like, hey, we have officially launched more tools than the coal bar hammer company."
6083560,6089080," Maybe we should just offer to buy them and finally push it over the finish line."
6089080,6095800," No, no, no, no, no. For a wide variety of reasons, I think no, no, no, no."
6095800,6101080," I'd love to hear more about your reasons. It has taken this long."
6103640,6108280," What do you think the state of the project said? I don't know. If you buy the company, do you buy"
6108280,6117320," their debt? I don't know. Maybe. But do you make the coal bar hammer? And do you make that back?"
6117320,6126840," Do you? Do you want to make the coal forever? Would you be better off just sicking Kyle or whoever else"
6126840,6132120," on ice? It makes no sense. But let's say you even wanted to make a hammer."
6133160,6139400," I think you'd be better off just having him design a hammer instead of just buying out"
6139400,6145320," this probably at this point in time, not even good design for a hammer. And like, it tries to do"
6145320,6151800," way too many things. If all you had it do was be able to break into a crowbar and also be a hammer,"
6151800,6155640," and that was it and just limited the other stuff, he could probably make one that was way better."
6155640,6161320," I have some bad news, Luke. What? Top message. Or I should call it top-keckage."
6161320,6170200," From Nick Light."
6170200,6179560," Not gonna lie, I thought about the coal bar idea a month or so ago. I think it's hilarious and I'm"
6179560,6185000," down. How many people are you even gonna get the joke? It doesn't have to be a joke. Maybe we can"
6185000,6192200," actually make it good. How would you want to make a hammer? Okay, backpack. I get it. I didn't buy it"
6192200,6199080," for me. I have a hammer. It's great. It's a hunk of metal that goes up and then goes both"
6199080,6204280," directions. But does it also go bry bar? And it's grown. And all the other crap it does?"
6204280,6211560," Darn it. I don't think most people are going to get the joke."
6213560,6215320," It doesn't even have to be a joke. What if it's just good?"
6215320,6222360," I buy the car hammer from my dad, says Conrad. Heck yeah. We can all buy one for our dad."
6222360,6228920," I was gonna say if we sell a coal bar hammer indirectly to everyone's dad."
6228920,6235320," Then it's fine. We're too great. Great business model. In all seriousness, I do have one that I'm"
6235320,6239960," pretty excited about that is very early stages. So who knows if it'll ever even make it across"
6239960,6245880," the finish line, but I want to do a battery bank that is kind of steamedex style."
6245880,6253640," So don't replace the cells. But also if you're going to do it, here's how to do it."
6253640,6258200," Yeah, that'd be sweet. So the idea would be like the last battery bank you'd ever buy."
6258200,6265240," If it's possible, I'd love to figure out if there's a way for us to make the firmware"
6265240,6273080," upgradable so that if let's say someone like Nintendo who uses USB PD, but in kind of a"
6273080,6277640," wonky different than everyone else way, so your switch can die if you use a standard power brick."
6277640,6285800," You know, that sort of thing, right? So if there's a way for us to firmware update it so that we can"
6285800,6289320," account for things like that, obviously things, bad things might still happen."
6289320,6296120," But if we can continue to tweak it over time, I think that would be a super valuable product."
6296120,6302280," And I think that's one of the big things that we're really going to continue to focus on as we"
6302280,6308040," go forward because that's what's really differentiated backpack and screwdrivers. We figured out what"
6308040,6312680," we wanted to exist and then made it exist, right? Like with something like a t-shirt,"
6312680,6317720," I think there's a little less room for innovation. But for something like that, that battery bank,"
6317720,6322520," I think absolutely we are identifying something that is a problem and we're fixing it."
6322520,6327640," I hate to say it. Yeah. It's been said a million times. It's been thought about. I think it might"
6327640,6336520," have even been decided to not do. But if you do socks and if you do sandals, you've literally"
6336520,6345960," completed the outfit. You could walk outside, respectively, maybe not respectively. You could"
6345960,6354840," walk outside legally wearing entirely LTT clothing. That would be pretty sick. I understand it's"
6354840,6359880," hard to do, but that would be pretty sick. And the amount of people that would buy socks and sandals,"
6359880,6363880," LTT edition, I think is pretty solid. I think there's a business argument there as well."
6363880,6371560," I need new socks pretty bad. I've been holding out for like years. The real motivation. Yeah."
6371560,6377720," Oh, I'm being transparent about it. It's time. I have to go buy new socks. So we're not going to"
6377720,6384520," hit my time window, unfortunately. But yeah, I think that'd be sweet. Darn tough. If you guys"
6384520,6397560," want to work together, hit me up. Yeah. Deodorant. Frankly, we couldn't make anything strong"
6397560,6406920," enough for our audience. Love you guys, but bare feet is high gene legal, not everywhere."
6406920,6410680," There are places that you have to have coverings on your feet."
6410680,6424840," No, I don't know. Speaking of buying companies, if you could choose another content creator"
6424840,6431720," to join the LMG staff, who would it be? I don't know how to answer this question without it being"
6431720,6439000," like, yeah, honestly, I think we, I think we skip that. Do I abstain? How about instead of the one,"
6439000,6444360," I could pick like all one that I'd love to work with? All of them. We would love to work with"
6444360,6449800," everyone. I mean, it's tough. You know, man, it's tough because just because I really like someone"
6449800,6453080," and respect them as a content creator and would love to work with them every day,"
6453080,6457880," doesn't mean I think they should be acquired. Right? Like, let's take, okay, let's take someone"
6457880,6463480," we talked about last week. Okay, Sarah Deachy, right? She has a totally different perspective on tech."
6463480,6468840," She is no reason to do that. Yeah. Great. Great on her own."
6468840,6476440," Exactly. She's doing great on her own. She's probably more valuable to the greater community as an indie."
6478120,6487160," Why like what? If all we wanted to do was, you know, make sure that she had, let's say she,"
6487160,6491560," she hadn't just killed it on her lab 22 launch or whatever else. So let's say that our, you know,"
6491560,6495640," she was struggling in some way or something. If all we wanted to do was make sure she had like"
6495640,6500840," consistent income or something like that. Well, like, what are we, what are we getting out of it?"
6500840,6507000," So presumably we expect profit at some point. So if that's our motivation, well, what are we going"
6507000,6513000," to do to squeeze her publication for more profit? Is that even going to provide any kind of service"
6513000,6517000," to her viewers? It has to be a win, win, win, right? It has to be a win for us, a win for her,"
6517000,6520360," a win for the audience. And if it's not a win, win, win, then it doesn't make sense. And I can't"
6520360,6530040," think of too many that would fit in that category. Yeah, it's tough. That's really tough. Because I,"
6530040,6539480," I mean, you see what was it MCN's? You see what MCN's did to people. Yeah, just extract value."
6539480,6545240," You don't want to be an MCN. That's stupid, blame and annoying. And no one likes you and you're dumb."
6545240,6552440," So like Linus said, there has to be value in both directions. There has to be something that's"
6552440,6562040," truly beneficial for them. And we could get them editors and videographers and stuff like that."
6562040,6566200," But a lot of these creators already have solutions for that. Some creators actually"
6566200,6571640," are unwilling to give up the creative control of editing. So want to do it themselves,"
6571640,6576760," which is respectable. That's an approach, whatever. I'm not making any judgment on that. But like"
6576760,6582840," some people wouldn't even want those benefits is what I'm saying. Yeah, I don't know. It's really"
6582840,6587640," tough. There's a lot of people that I would like love to work with more closely because I think"
6587640,6591560," it would be freaking awesome. But I don't think that would necessarily be better for anyone other"
6591560,6600680," than it just being like cool. Question from Jay, do you think we'll ever see ram slots on GPUs"
6600680,6609800," for choosing how much ram you want? Nope. Never. Should we explain in more detail or just leave it"
6609800,6617640," there? All right, we'll explain in more detail. What's the trend you see in terms of ram's physical"
6617640,6625560," proximity to processing power? Let's look at Apple's M1 processor, where they've actually got the ram"
6626120,6635640," right on the package closer. GPUs were one of the first consumer devices in your system that"
6635640,6644680," brought the ram off of an installable module that's just out of necessity, quite physically"
6644680,6650520," distant from the processor and from the memory controller and put it right on the board,"
6650520,6656520," soldered to the board right next to the processor. Why? Because GPUs needed"
6656520,6662920," mondo memory bandwidth in order to move texture data and other game assets back and forth."
6662920,6668920," So what you're never going to see then and look at the highest performance."
6668920,6674840," I don't know what that was. Look at the highest performance GPUs today. They actually bring the"
6674840,6683160," memory even closer with HBM. So those, because the traces are so short, are much easier to run at"
6683160,6688840," much higher frequencies. And so the last thing you're going to see the GPU industry do is"
6688840,6697160," trend back the other way to modules. Not only are they physically more distant, but any time you have"
6697160,6704200," an interface like that, like a slot, like a socket and a pin interface or anything like that,"
6704200,6710360," you're going to have some loss. And that loss is bad for signal integrity, which is bad for,"
6710360,6715080," you guessed it, higher switching speeds, which is bad for bandwidth. So it's just,"
6715080,6720440," it's never going to happen. I'm pretty sure it did happen way in the past as well."
6720440,6726760," And it's not done anymore, which doesn't always mean a lot, but in this case, I think it does."
6726760,6732920," We got a food question here. Lucan Linus, what was the most memorable meal of your life?"
6732920,6737480," Easy. I have an answer for this that is easy and I'll lock it in. Do you want to go first?"
6737480,6742520," No, I hit me. I think it might even be the same because you were there."
6742520,6749240," Oh, was it the first, the first dinner? The first LMG dinner? Oh, different one."
6749240,6750520," Darn it."
6750520,6755960," Because that was pretty memorable. We had that like truffle and stuff. Like it was a whole,"
6755960,6759720," I'm not really sure. It was a whole thing. Yeah, that was kind of big. The first LMG Christmas"
6759720,6768040," party was not really a Christmas party. And we could like, we, okay, to put it in perspective,"
6768040,6772440," our first meal when we landed in Las Vegas, that first year was chicken nuggets because they were"
6772440,6776920," cheap. Dude, we got a whole table of chicken nuggets. So we bawled out on chicken nuggets."
6776920,6784760," We had no money. But to celebrate the success of our CES trip and the connections we'd made and"
6784760,6789240," the sponsorships that we had started conversations about and all that good stuff,"
6789240,6795240," we went out for one nice dinner. And I was like, maybe we'll make this a tradition. That tradition"
6795240,6801160," has since become the annual Christmas party. But when it started, it was just me, Ed, Luke,"
6801160,6810360," and Brandon, and Luke's friend. And we, we kind of, you know, for us went kind of wild in terms of"
6810360,6815720," ordering. It felt pretty nuts. I remember like being worried about the company's books because"
6815720,6820200," we got like a $50 fried rice. I remember specifically that fried rice."
6820200,6829400," That was the, as much as I remember that fried rice, the food itself"
6829400,6838120," wasn't, was not great. Yeah, I didn't care like at all. That was a big moment in like my life."
6838120,6843960," But the meal isn't what made that memorable. So I think that's fair. Like,"
6844840,6849480," I wouldn't have picked my wedding just because it was about the wedding. It wasn't about the meal."
6849480,6853640," Yeah. So, okay. So that's the reason why I think my brain didn't go there. My brain went to a"
6853640,6861000," different dinner that you were also at Japan. Yes. Yeah. We, we stayed at this. It was a hotel in"
6861000,6865080," Japan that was like, Oh, it's like a thousand years old or some crazy, like I remember hearing"
6865080,6869000," that and being like, no way. And then I looked into it and it's like, uh, yep, that's true."
6870040,6878840," It was at a hot spring. We were, it was just amazing. We had a, uh, a meal in at the hotel in this like"
6878840,6885000," big open room. Uh, there was like three waitresses for like the, what was it? Like 12 of us that were"
6885000,6891720," there or something? Crazy one chef for just us. I still have, it's, it's still on my fridge. It"
6891720,6897960," will always be on my fridge. I still have the like the, it's not a menu. It's like the order that"
6897960,6902120," the dishes come in. I can't read it because it's in Japanese, but, um, that was,"
6902120,6908040," I know it was an incredible meal. I don't know. And it was, it, it does have the other components and"
6908040,6913160," it's probably cheating because of that to be fair. Because that was also a pretty big moment for us."
6913160,6919400," Um, the, the people that were there were awesome. There was a lot of other things going on,"
6919400,6925720," but the meal itself, like, Oh man, how many, it was like some insane number of courses,"
6925720,6931160," like over 12, I think. And chicken sashimi is definitely the most, um, adventurous thing I've"
6931160,6935160," eaten. You ate it too? Yeah. I didn't remember if you did. Yeah. We were, I remember both of us"
6935160,6941480," tried it. Yeah. And then cooked the rest of our chicken, which they were not a huge fan of."
6941480,6953960," It is what it is. Um, but yeah, that was amazing. Yeah. That was for the Amron factory."
6953960,6957000," What video is tied to that trip? Yeah. Amron, there's also a wancho,"
6957000,6964600," which is probably one of the more unique wanchos we ever did. Um,"
6964600,6967880," Ed was passed out drunk behind the camera."
6967880,6978440," Like it's a miracle. He managed to get the camera pointed in the right direction before he fell"
6978440,6983640," asleep on the stairs, but the stuff he has been able to accomplish wouldn't, would need to do his,"
6984120,6994840," is impressive. Absolutely unit. Yeah. Oh man. Okay. Speaking of travel, Tamas asks,"
6994840,6998120," if there's a country or place that you've always wanted to visit, but haven't had the chance to."
6998120,7003720," I'll go to Australia or New Zealand. I heard that's the place to be when the apocalypse comes."
7003720,7010840," What? Because they're already like trained in dealing with it? No, it's because there's nothing"
7010840,7016280," of real strategic value. It's far enough away from everything that is of strategic value that the"
7016280,7023480," fallout won't really get there. And it's like temperate and like pretty developed world in terms"
7023480,7030600," of infrastructure and like standard living, relatively self-sufficient. I know New Zealand is checking"
7030600,7035880," a lot of those boxes specifically. Yep. Those are definitely up there. A lot of the places that I"
7035880,7040360," really wanted to go, I have gone to. So that knocks off a bunch of stuff, to be honest. I would really"
7040360,7045640," like to go back to Japan. I barely even count our trip there as like actually being in Japan."
7045640,7050680," We were there for like less than 24 hours, weren't they? weren't we? And we slept. So like it was"
7050680,7057160," very short period of time. I think I'm going to cop out and say Japan because I don't really count"
7057160,7062360," being there for literally less than 24 hours as really being in Japan. Even though I literally"
7062360,7065960," just mentioned one of my favorite dinners being there. I found out why this was 600 calories."
7066520,7071000," Look at the disgusting amount of sauce in it. Yeah. Like I can only eat half of this."
7071000,7077160," Ikins it's not completely saturated in mayonnaise water. It's got quite the aroma. Yeah."
7077160,7080120," We've got this like hummus thing though."
7080120,7085640," Graphic Wars with Hardware in Box in Australia. Yeah. I mean we've said all the unfortunate"
7085640,7089160," reasons why Scrappy Wars like isn't. Yeah it's dead. Sorry guys. Yeah."
7092440,7097800," Question here from Mike. My kids love my LTC water bottle. That's not really a question."
7097800,7101960," Would you consider making a smaller one for kids? Maybe with artwork from the ABCs of gaming?"
7101960,7107080," Yes. We're already working on a smaller one. We hadn't thought of putting ABCs of gaming"
7107080,7112120," characters on it yet but good idea. Yeah I get a lot of comments and a merge message about people"
7112120,7116600," loving the ABCs of gaming. So that'd be cool. I think it's because I specifically mentioned"
7116600,7120440," during the screwdriver stream that I read every review. Some people have left some"
7121320,7126440," really sweet reviews over the last few days. Thank you very much. It was a labor of love so"
7126440,7131400," yeah I really appreciate it. Next one here is from Elliot."
7131400,7137640," Linus you've talked about your disdain of closed ecosystems and smart homes many times on the show."
7137640,7141880," But you've also said you're super down for a biometric implant. Are you less concerned about"
7141880,7147480," biotech when compared to all this closed ecosystem? Well I wouldn't go for a closed ecosystem biotech"
7147480,7152680," implant. Yeah there's a lot of caveats there. The biometric implants that we're talking about"
7152680,7158280," are quite simple. Yeah like an NFC thing that I can just program to just like spit out you know"
7158280,7162680," a bunch of characters when I scan a thing. Like I'm talking really really really basic stuff right"
7162680,7169640," now. Yeah yeah very user controllable type of stuff. From Joshua how did you navigate the"
7169640,7173560," transition from a small to medium sized business? I'm working for a small company for the first"
7173560,7179480," time and we're rapidly growing. Any tips would be great. Higher PR person."
7179480,7188280," And then don't ignore them. There we go."
7188280,7197480," And all seriousness though I mean you just got to keep iterating right. Just keep learning as you"
7197480,7205240," go. I'm not a business. I'm not like a business guru type person. I'm not. I don't read a lot of"
7205240,7212760," business books. When I read them what I usually discover is that a lot of what I find in them"
7212760,7217720," is stuff that I did figure out along the way. Maybe not exactly the same way. To be clear I'm"
7217720,7221960," not saying I'm some kind of genius. Well I figured everything out as we love my own."
7221960,7228120," Like it's not like that at all but the problems that I've had to solve I've solved them. So I guess"
7228120,7235400," what I'm saying is take time identify problems solve them in ways that are scalable for the"
7235400,7242840," long term. Don't just solve problems short term. I just don't I just I I mean even the way we've"
7242840,7252840," moved into our house. Like you've seen it. A room goes from absolute chaos to perfection because I"
7252840,7257800," just do not have the cycles to do something that I know I'm going to have to do again."
7257800,7262600," It's not worth it to me. And that's one of the things I've I've learned as we've scaled."
7262600,7268920," And if it's not going to save you time in the future don't do it. There's a flow plane question."
7269640,7275240," Any new secret shoppers in the work hold on. I genuinely don't know. I'm not on the team that"
7275240,7280200," plans that type of stuff. I cannot actually answer this question. What I will say is you shouldn't"
7280200,7285320," even ask due to the nature of secret shopper. They can't tell you and you don't want to know"
7285320,7293320," because you don't want anyone else to know. There you go. Yeah. Well pickles lord of the jar wants to"
7293320,7298840," know. Just a few months back you're worried about the prospect of your new products not selling well"
7298840,7303480," enough. With this recent success do you feel more confident about launching future high-end"
7303480,7309560," merch deployments. It always depends right like nothing I can't take anything for granted. I've I"
7309560,7315320," feel like it's one of those things where if you guys just bought it because it had our label on it"
7315320,7322440," I'd be like have I taught you nothing you know so I think that there's a lot of pressure on us to"
7322440,7330280," keep making stuff that stands out and will be successful. Yeah I don't really feel any less of that."
7330280,7336120," I don't feel like past success is necessarily an indicator of future success in in in that"
7336120,7342200," particular regard. I think that you probably can carry some momentum forward but that momentum"
7342200,7347320," is short lived right if you guys buy one thing from us where you're like oh yeah I heard like"
7347320,7353880," LTT has really good quality stuff but I didn't like this you're never going to buy anything again so"
7353880,7358280," we kind of have to we don't have to hit it out of the park every time but you can never hit less"
7358280,7367160," than like a line drive single to use a baseball metaphor. Question here from Lucas Linus you've"
7367160,7371720," talked about VR a lot but what are your thoughts on AR headsets have you tried them like HoloLens"
7371720,7378920," and do you think we'll ever reach mass adoption? Not with HoloLens. Have you tried it? Yeah"
7378920,7388680," yeah it's kind of bad. Yeah so for me really it's not a question of how cool is this technology"
7388680,7393160," what can we do with it? It's a question of what do I want to do and can this technology do it?"
7393960,7404920," For me the killer app for AR is memory augmentation. I can never remember who people are or like where"
7404920,7410280," I know them from or the last thing we talked about or how many kids they have if I had a contact lens"
7410280,7418040," that I could wear that was like Luke mentioned his bird last time you guys were hanging out was"
7418040,7425000," having some health related issues you should check in with him about that. I can't even I can't I"
7425000,7430440," don't even think I could put a sticker price on what I would pay or something like that and I"
7430440,7435240," wouldn't be the only person like in a professional setting people literally will hire assistants"
7435240,7441400," whose entire job it is to follow them around at events and like cross-reference and like provide"
7441400,7446920," them with information as people approach like that's actually a thing right so in a professional"
7446920,7455880," setting I could see something like that being invaluable but I don't know man maybe navigation"
7455880,7463320," like a really slick navigation navigation and a facial recognition thing that can tell me who"
7463320,7471800," people are and maybe some basic information would be fantastic. I will remember so many details about"
7471800,7477960," someone and not their name and not their birthday but I'll remember like lots of things about them"
7477960,7482760," I'll be able to jump back into a conversation and as long as they don't expect me to say their name"
7482760,7491560," or remember their birthday yeah I'll do great but yeah nighttime astronaut asks given the importance"
7491560,7495560," of the WAN show now in terms of LMG's contact with the community and consumers should Bell be"
7495560,7501960," given a substantial pay increase and maybe some kind of crown or cape to denote his incredible role."
7501960,7507240," I like the crown and cape. I like the crown and cape but see the reason I the reason I brought up"
7507240,7513640," this comment is because I see comments like this a lot you know Kyle did a great job in this video"
7513640,7519720," he should get a raise or this person did this they should get a raise that is not how it works"
7520280,7525960," at all. What do you mean? That's not how it works. What do you mean? First of all you're assuming"
7525960,7532600," that they're not already paid fairly second of all guys the people who are in front of the camera"
7532600,7538520," are a small fraction of the people who work here you don't just give the person who gets the"
7538520,7546040," screen time the raise we have we have dozens of other people that supported that that made"
7546040,7552680," whatever it is that Bell or Kyle or I am doing possible who also need to be paid fairly if we"
7552680,7558760," just gave raises to people every time they did anything of value that was public facing"
7558760,7568760," our pay scale would be f*cked like a mess. No that's not how it works as much as I appreciate"
7568760,7574040," the sentiment when people will say then Anthony did a great job of this video he should get a raise"
7574920,7582600," that's just it's just not how it works I'm sorry no offense Bell you know you're great"
7582600,7586760," you know heart they wouldn't even see the cape in the crown. The crown and cape though"
7586760,7592760," but crown and cape I'm down for it. Yeah okay you've got you've got a $40 crown and cape budget. Let's go"
7592760,7597480," boys. Yeah just let logistics know they can sort something for you all right. You could just get a"
7597480,7603800," BK crown for free and then get a sweet $40 cape. That's exactly the plan. Yeah nice."
7603800,7609560," And we'll get you guys a bell cam so when we're doing merch messages we can just put him like in"
7609560,7613960," the middle here so we'll just get like a face cam for him. We down we're good. Yeah I'll get a"
7613960,7619640," really old one so it looks like an old 90s embassy. Let's do it let's do it let's go."
7619640,7626200," Questioning from Cameron do you have any thoughts on the GBD Win 3 there's been a lot of comparisons"
7626200,7632200," but I'd love to know your thoughts. We checked out the GBD Win Max 2 recently"
7632200,7639960," but the Win 3 oh you know what no I haven't I haven't really looked into this one yet. Sorry"
7639960,7645320," nope not yet someday soon looks sick though. Yeah."
7645320,7651240," Another AR thing. Oh no this is the old one. GBD Win 3 no this this one's old."
7652200,7656200," Yeah it's cool but it's a little it's yeah it's a little older. The slide out keyboard doesn't"
7656200,7662680," have a ton of value for me. I'll say that. Another AR thing is I would love a really fancy"
7662680,7669560," calendar slash alarm app where I can signify when like something is unmissable."
7669560,7677800," And by unmissable I mean like blast my face with it. Like make it so that I it's because it's"
7677800,7684040," literally covering my eyes. It's like impossible to not at least respond in some way to it. Like"
7684040,7689160," do not let this notification not come in basically. That would be great."
7689160,7693480," Honestly that could be solved with just oh yeah totally could."
7693480,7699320," Being able to set a persistent ringer on reminders like an alarm like hey anyone from the Android"
7699320,7704360," team if you're watching can that just be a feature next time around so that you can set a different"
7704360,7708920," alarm style like a looping alarm style on reminders and on calendar notifications"
7708920,7715240," that would be just a game changer for me. That'd be sweet. Like I actually need to go to this"
7715240,7720440," meeting. Do not stop until I acknowledge that I am at the meeting."
7720440,7725720," There would be cool if you could do it like I am there thing because there's also times where"
7725720,7730120," you're like oh I get a notification okay cool I don't have to do this thing and then you just get"
7730120,7735640," blasted by some like huge something's on fire problem. You need to immediately solve"
7735640,7740440," and then you need to remember to go back to that meeting but once the thing is not on fire"
7740440,7744920," anymore you forget about the notification. While we're at it it would be great if in the calendar"
7744920,7751000," app I could set what my default reminder schedule is because I always have to go in and manually say"
7751000,7755160," hey I need to know the day before. I need to know the hour before and I need to know the amount of"
7755160,7758600," time it takes for me to get there before because otherwise I won't go."
7758600,7761080," Yeah yeah agreed."
7761080,7767320," Question we have here from a lot of people what are your thoughts about the person"
7767320,7770440," winning an art contest with an AI generated piece of art?"
7770440,7780840," As someone who doesn't really get art but who can certainly appreciate seeing something I like"
7782040,7791480," and values the work that goes into it. I guess I'm excited for being able to just like"
7791480,7797880," for the cost of getting a print done decorate my house which I think is super cool."
7797880,7808040," I see it as a potential danger to the craft though of art over time so while it's pretty"
7808040,7813960," easy for me to say okay I saw someone tweet at me a portrait of Linus Sebastian in the style of"
7813960,7818600," Rembrandt right and they like they looked awesome if I wanted a portrait of myself in the style of"
7818600,7827000," Rembrandt I guess I could put that up I don't but what's going to be the style then what will be"
7827000,7833080," the the future styles that we can plug into our our AI generator. With that said maybe it's a"
7833080,7841080," totally invalid concern people create art just because they wish to create art and the value of"
7841080,7847240," something created by a person doesn't seem to be tied to the number of hours they spent on it the"
7847240,7852600," ease with which it could be replicated by something else it's about the it's about the person it's"
7852600,7859960," about that that aura around them right we don't we don't we don't pay a hundred thousand dollars"
7859960,7867960," for a painting or whatever else because it looks the it looks $90,000 prettier than a $10,000 painting"
7867960,7872920," that's just like not how it works it's about it's about who you know and it's about connections"
7872920,7877800," and it's about notoriety and so I don't think that an AI artist I think that it could absolutely"
7877800,7884440," take out a lot of commodity art but I don't think it's going to take out like high-end art"
7885480,7889640," like boutique art if that kind of makes sense yeah like hide your money from taxes art"
7889640,7892280," yeah won't take that well it's a whole separate conversation yeah"
7892280,7900200," oh for me on the art thing I think it's just completely down to whoever's hosting the contest"
7900200,7904520," do you allow or do you not it's like the same thing with speedruns right tool assisted speedruns"
7904520,7909640," task speedruns those are they have their own category you could have an art contest for"
7909640,7914760," for AI generated art whatever I think it's down to the contest I don't think I it's I I'm going to"
7914760,7920360," say the same as Linus so I'm not in that space I'm very far from being an artist yeah echelu"
7920360,7924760," over on twitch says AI art only looks good as a professional artist you need to be able to thoroughly"
7924760,7930440," explain your context to be taken seriously but yeah it's fair enough I don't give two about any"
7930440,7937160," of that but I suspect AI artists could also start working with GPT-3 and have it write a blurb that"
7937160,7942840," goes along with the art and explain why it's cool if you think that's a limitation now I'll see you in"
7942840,7952600," two years but either way I just I think it's always going to be a different different space yeah yeah I"
7952600,7959800," agree like smart smartphones put cameras and put video recorders in the pockets of of everybody and"
7959800,7968840," that doesn't make it so that you don't still need like filmmakers right like it's yeah what we also"
7968840,7975240," see is that you can sell prompts for the ais to generate stuff which I think is so interesting"
7975240,7980440," it's like this guy who was in the art contest was like I will share what my prompt was to get this"
7980440,7986360," art later and like is trying to sell this prompt to get the art that he had made that one so"
7986360,7994200," very interesting future I mean it's a kind of IP I guess yeah yeah it's like if you're if you're"
7994200,8002360," really good at configuring the machine that has a value so sure yeah I'm just very surprised but"
8002360,8008840," makes sense similar things have been done in the past question from mica what's your favorite part"
8008840,8015400," about running a youtube channel slash youtube media company I know what's not to like it's the"
8015400,8029800," coolest job ever thank you best part I don't know it's nice that someone listens you know feeling"
8029800,8036440," like part of a community um and then we're social creatures right like we all are sort of"
8036440,8043640," fundamentally drawn to a lot of the same things turning what you would have done every day anyway"
8043640,8047800," into into work is it a bit of a double edged sword I'd say it's the best and one of the"
8047800,8052680," worst things about it but it's definitely one of the best even if it might also be one of the worst"
8052680,8060440," yeah there's a lot to love that's it for merch messages that's it oh well then I guess that's"
8060440,8065160," it for the show pretty good timing yeah thank you so much for tuning in this week we'll see you again"
8065160,8067160," next week same bad time same bad time"
